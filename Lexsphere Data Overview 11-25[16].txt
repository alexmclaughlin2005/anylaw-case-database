Lexsphere Data Overview Lexsphere owns and maintains a proprietary, continuously updated database of millions of precedential U.S. judicial opinions. The dataset includes full-text appellate decisions, citations, dockets, and metadata across all 50 states and federal jurisdictions. The system is designed for accuracy, coverage, and seamless integration with enterprise workflows. 1. Dataset Overview The AnyLaw Case Library contains over 8 million cases spanning 209 jurisdictions and more than 400 courts. It includes the U.S. Supreme Court, all Federal Circuit Courts, District Courts, State Supreme and Appellate Courts, Bankruptcy Courts, and Tribal Courts. Category Count Jurisdictions 200+ Courts 400 + Cases 8.5 M + Monthly Additions 20 K +  2. Data Architecture & Processing Pipeline Lexsphere’s data pipeline automates acquisition, parsing, and enrichment of court opinions. Cases are collected from court websites via crawlers and public APIs, then parsed, validated, deduplicated, and indexed into Elasticsearch. A screenshot of a computerAI-generated content may be incorrect. 3. Data Structure & Format   Each case in the Lexsphere database is represented as a unified JSON document that combines the full opinion text with structured metadata such as jurisdiction, docket number, opinion date, and citations. Source Files. Original case law files are preserved in their native formats (primarily PDF, with some HTML) exactly as received from each court. These raw files are securely stored in Lexsphere’s AWS S3 bucket to ensure authenticity and auditability. Metadata Layer. For every opinion, the pipeline generates a corresponding structured JSON metadata file extracted from the court’s source. This metadata includes key identifiers — court name, docket number, publication status, opinion date, and outbound citations — which are normalized and validated against the originating source.  Unified Record. During indexing, the parsed opinion text is merged with its metadata to create a single JSON document containing multiple tagged fields (e.g., jurisdiction, citations, court level, and publication status). This unified design allows new tags, filters, or AI-generated enrichments (summaries, holdings, or analytics) to be added without altering the core structure. Indexing & Retrieval. All unified JSON records are indexed into Elasticsearch, enabling high-speed search, categorization, and classification across millions of opinions. The dataset is fully optimized for ingestion into a variety of databases including vector databases, or AI model pipelines, supporting both real-time querying and bulk analysis.    4. Maintenance and Quality Assurance AnyLaw continuously monitors all participating court sites to ensure coverage completeness and freshness. Processes include backfilling, metadata normalization, citation linking, deduplication, and validation against court records. Quality assurance workflows are automated yet regularly audited by the Lexsphere team. 5. Use Cases for Licensees Enterprise partners leverage Lexsphere data to: 1. Train and fine-tune legal AI models (RAG, LLMs). 2. Embed legal research tools within practice management platforms. 3. Power analytics, citators, and compliance solutions. 4. Support academic, judicial, or institutional research initiatives. 6. Courts The following is a list of our collection of opinions for jurisdictions includes both the lower appellate court(s) and the upper or final court of appeal for that jurisdiction, whatever it might be named. Because the court systems of states are independent from federal jurisdictions, there is no continuity in terms of start dates for either the lower appellate courts nor the final court of appeal, both largely depending on each state’s unique legislation. In addition, lower appellate courts, make their decisions available for public databasing and thus a very few may not be represented within this collection. Tribal law is included in the collection.  Court Start Date U.S. Supreme Court 1882   U.S. Federal Circuit Courts, Included States  1st Circuit: MA, ME, NH, PR, RI 1930   2nd Circuit: CT, NY, VT 1930   3rd Circuit: DE, NJ, PA, VI 1930   4th Circuit: MD, NC, SC, VA, WV 1930   5th Circuit: LA, MS, TX 1930   6th Circuit: KY, MI, OH, TN) 1930   7th Circuit: IL, IN, WI) 1930   8th Circuit: AR, IA, MN, MO, ND, NE, SD 1930   9th Circuit: AK, AZ, CA, GU, HI, ID, MP, MT, NV, OR, WA 1941   10th Circuit: CO, KS, NM, OK, UT, WY 1930   11th Circuit: AL, FL, GA 1981   D.
