    "body": "Submitted: June 13, 2001\n\nUPON APPEAL FROM THE SUPERIOR COURT. AFFIRMED.\n\nI. Introduction\n\nThomas J. Capano was found guilty of first degree murder and sentenced to death for the murder of Anne Marie Fahey. As with all capital cases in Delaware, the proceedings here were divided into a guilt phase, a penalty hearing and a sentencing determination by the trial judge, who gave substantial weight to the jury's recommendation following the penalty hearing.\n\nCapano was arrested for Fahey's murder in November 1997 and indicted in December 1997. His trial began in Superior Court in October 1998. The guilt phase of this proceeding before the jury was quite long, spanning approximately thirty-two trial days spread over ten weeks from October 6, 1998 to January 17, 1999. After the jury unanimously found Capano guilty of first degree murder, the penalty hearing commenced. It lasted for five days and resulted in findings by the jury on aggravating and mitigating circumstances. In the penalty phase the jury found a statutory aggravating circumstance by a vote of 11 to 1 and recommended by a vote of 10 to 2 that the trial judge find the aggravating circumstances outweighed the mitigating circumstances.\n\nAfter giving proper weight to those findings, the Superior Court Judge sentenced Capano to death on March 16, 1999. This appeal followed. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e2\u003c/span\u003e Capano asserts the following sixteen grounds for reversal of the conviction and sentence, in the order presented by him on this appeal--not in the order discussed in this Opinion:\n\n1. The trial court's failure to instruct the jury on the lesser included offenses to the charged offense of Murder First Degree;\n\n2. The admission of Fahey's hearsay statements to her psychotherapists and friends;\n\n3. The introduction of prejudicial \"bad act\" and \"character\" evidence;\n\n4. Evidence and argument suggesting that Gerry Capano took a lie detector test;\n\n5. Improper cross-examination of Capano and improper remarks to the jury in closing argument;\n\n6. Allowing witnesses to express personal opinions that Capano was guilty;\n\n7. The trial court's failure to investigate juror bias or misconduct and to dismiss a juror for alleged misconduct;\n\n8. Capano's absence from certain office conferences in violation of his Sixth Amendment right to be present at all stages of trial;\n\n9. The trial court's decision not to require the State to turn over to the defense evidence of Gerry Capano's drug use;\n\n10. The trial court improperly limited Capano's allocution;\n\n11. The trial court's charge on the aggravating circumstance that \"the murder was premeditated and the result of substantial planning\" was erroneous;\n\n12. Delaware's death penalty statute is unconstitutional because it does not require unanimous jury findings with respect to aggravating circumstances;\n\n13. Imposition of the death penalty in this case is disproportionate to the penalty imposed in other cases;\n\n14. The trial judge was not impartial and therefore reversal is required, or in the alternative, a remand to develop facts related to this issue;\n\n15. The trial court's inconsistent admission of evidence of marital infidelity to impeach the credibility of witnesses; and\n\n16. The prosecutor's cross-examination of Capano concerning post-arrest silence.\n\nA. Summary of Conclusions Reached on Appeal\n\nThis being an appeal in a death penalty case we apply a high degree of scrutiny to the sixteen issues Capano has presented to us in this direct appeal. Four of the sixteen issues were selected for oral argument. Three of these issues were selected by Capano's appellate counsel in the first oral argument held on October 24, 2000. The fourth issue was selected sua sponte by the Court for additional briefing and oral argument held on June 13, 2001.\n\nWe deal in this Summary with these four issues and a fifth significant issue that was not selected for oral argument either by Capano or by the Court. The remaining eleven issues are dealt with carefully in this Opinion. But they will not be mentioned in this summary of the conclusions reached on appeal.\n\nAs to all sixteen issues we find no reversible error and we affirm the judgment of the trial court. Nevertheless, the five principal issues mentioned in this Summary raise substantial questions that have given us some areas of concern. After a thorough review of the extensive trial record, the voluminous briefs of the parties, two oral arguments and the applicable law, however, our concerns have been resolved. It is now clear to us that there is no reversible error either in the guilt phase or the penalty phase in the proceedings in the Superior Court.\n\n1. The Lie Detector Test\n\nTwo major categories of evidentiary issues are dealt with at the outset in this Opinion. The first relates to Gerry Capano's testimony and that of his lawyer relating to a lie detector test. Testimony regarding the results of lie detector tests are normally inadmissible. That was not the issue here. The issue here related to references to the lie detector test involving Gerry. It was the mention of the threat of a lie detector test in testimony describing the dénouement of the government's investigation as its agents were seeking to persuade Gerry to testify against his brother.\n\nWe hold that mention of the lie detector test as the trigger point for Gerry's decision to cooperate and the related issue of his lawyer's vouching for Gerry's credibility were improper but not reversible error in light of the trial judge's limiting instruction and the totality of all the evidence presented in this long trial.\n\n2. Hearsay Testimony by Fahey's Psychotherapists and Friends\n\nFahey's diaries, emails between Capano and Fahey and the testimony of Kim Lynch-Horstmann were admitted into evidence by agreement of both the State and Capano. That stipulated evidence painted a general picture of Fahey's state of mind, her rocky, on-again-off-again relationship with Capano and her need for psychological treatment. A central theme of this stipulated evidence involved Capano's efforts to control Fahey's life.\n\nOver Capano's objection, the trial judge admitted other evidence offered by the State tending to show Fahey's state of mind, her attempts to seek psychiatric help and certain incidents that occurred in her relationship with Capano. That evidence, quoting Fahey, was admitted through the testimony of psychotherapists and friends. It was obvious hearsay, but it was admitted in evidence by the trial judge, often with careful limiting instructions to the jury as to its purpose, under exceptions to the hearsay rule for Fahey's state of mind and medical diagnosis or treatment.\n\nWe hold that the quotations from Fahey going to her state of mind were properly admitted under established exceptions to the hearsay rules. We further hold that certain testimony quoting Fahey's recollection of facts was inadmissible under the state of mind exception, but the admission of these factual recitations was not reversible error because the general subject matter was already subsumed in the stipulated evidence that Capano had agreed to present to the jury. We also hold, alternatively, that the psychotherapists' testimony regarding Fahey's statements to them for the purpose of diagnosis or treatment of her mental condition is independently admissible under the medical diagnosis and treatment exception to the hearsay rules. Finally, we conclude that this application of Delaware's exceptions to the hearsay rules does not run afoul of the Confrontation Clause of the United States Constitution.\n\n3. Lesser Included Offenses\n\nCapano contends that the trial judge erred in not instructing the jury that it could convict Capano of the lesser offenses of Murder Second Degree, Manslaughter or Criminally Negligent Homicide. The trial judge concluded that there was no rational basis in the evidence for a charge to the jury on any of these lesser included offenses because: (a) the State's case, if believed by the jury, tended to show only premeditated, first degree murder, and (b) Capano's testimony that the killing was a tragic accident was the only alternative evidence offered, and Capano's testimony was consistent only with an outright acquittal.\n\nWe hold that the trial judge was correct in not instructing the jury on the lesser included offenses. We find no rational basis in this record to support the argument that the jury could acquit Capano of First Degree Murder and convict him of any of the lesser included offenses. The evidence supported only a First Degree Murder conviction or an outright acquittal. Furthermore, we find no federal constitutional violation in the decision of the trial judge to decline to instruct the jury on the lesser included offenses under the facts of this case.\n\n4. Limits on Allocution\n\nCapano contends that the trial judge improperly restricted his right, in the penalty phase, to speak in allocution directly to the jury without being sworn or subject to cross-examination. Capano had testified at length before this jury in the guilt phase and he spoke to them extensively in allocution in the penalty phase. Capano argues that the trial judge improperly denied him the right to discuss or argue facts already in evidence at the guilt phase, and that the trial judge's harsh treatment in cutting him off in the presence of the jury unfairly prejudiced him. The question was first presented on appeal, so we review it on a plain error analysis.\n\nWe hold that the trial judge erroneously limited Capano's allocution by not permitting him to discuss or argue in allocution from facts already in the record. But we hold that this error was harmless under all the circumstances and Capano was not unduly prejudiced.\n\n5. Constitutionality of Delaware's Death Penalty Statute\n\nBased on a distinguishable recent United States Supreme Court Opinion, Capano argues that the Delaware Death Penalty Statute is unconstitutional. Capano claims that the statute unconstitutionally permits the trial judge, after a unanimous jury finding of guilt that authorizes the possibility of the death penalty, to decide to impose death without a unanimous jury recommendation in the penalty phase.\n\nWe hold that the authority relied on by Capano does not support this argument. The United States Supreme Court has never held that a judge's imposition of a death sentence following a unanimous finding of guilt by the jury and a less than unanimous recommendation of the jury in a penalty phase is a denial of the right to a jury trial or otherwise a denial of due process. We hold that the Delaware Death Penalty Statute is constitutional and was properly applied here.\n\nAccordingly, we have found no reversible error committed by the trial court and no basis to vacate the death sentence, either on the five issues summarized above or on any of the other issues raised on this appeal. Therefore, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court and remand the matter for the setting of a new execution date.\n\nB. Summary of Background Facts Leading to Trial\n\nThe facts of this case, as developed in the evidence adduced over the course of this ten-week trial, are extensive. What follows in this section is a bare summary of some of the salient facts. More detailed facts are discussed in connection with the various sections of this Opinion dealing with specific issues presented on appeal.\n\nAnne Marie Fahey, the scheduling secretary for Delaware's then Governor Thomas Carper, was last seen alive on Thursday, June 27, 1996, when she went to dinner with Capano in Philadelphia. Fahey's family reported on June 30, 1996, that she was missing. An extensive investigation concerning her disappearance ensued. That investigation culminated in November 1997, over sixteen months later, in Capano's arrest for her murder. Fahey's body was never found, however, and the State was unable to establish the precise manner by which Fahey died.\n\nCapano was a well-known Delaware lawyer and former managing partner at the Wilmington office of a major Philadelphia-based law firm. He was estranged from his wife and is the father of four daughters. He has three brothers (Louis Capano, Jr., Gerard \"Gerry\" Capano and Joseph Capano) and one sister, Marian (Capano) Ramunno. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e3\u003c/span\u003e\n\nFahey's disappearance was a mystery for a considerable time before Capano was charged with her murder. Capano, who was the last known person to have seen her alive on June 27, 1996, was an early suspect in the investigation by the Wilmington Police. By mid-July 1996, the FBI actively joined in the investigation, and a federal grand jury heard evidence for over a year. Capano continued to deny any involvement in Fahey's disappearance and even offered various explanations for her whereabouts. Throughout the investigation and until the Fall of 1997, Gerry and Louis Capano, as well as Deborah MacIntyre, a mistress of Tom Capano, continually lied about material evidence that could have implicated Capano, even to the extent of lying to the federal grand jury.\n\nIn October 1997, Gerry's house was raided by federal agents who found illegal drugs and weapons. In November 1997 Gerry agreed to become a cooperating witness in exchange for a plea to reduced charges. Louis also began to cooperate with the authorities in November 1997 as part of a plea agreement. MacIntyre likewise eventually agreed to cooperate in exchange for an agreement not to be charged with perjury.\n\nC. Summary of Facts: The State's Case\n\nThere were many witness presented by the State in its case-in-chief. The key witnesses included two of Capano's brothers, Gerry and Louis; Deborah MacIntyre; and psychotherapists and friends of Fahey. The State constructed a circumstantial theory of the case, which rested on three broad categories of evidence: (a) \"motive,\" (b) \"plan,\" and (c) \"consciousness of guilt.\"\n\nThe State's \"motive\" evidence consisted of statements Fahey recorded in her diary and those allegedly made to her family, friends and psychotherapists. Fahey began dating Capano in March 1994. She kept this relationship, or at least its intimate nature, hidden from most of her friends and her family, and even from the psychotherapist she was seeing at the time. Her personal diaries detailed her on-again-off-again relationship with Capano. Importantly, these diaries, as read into evidence by her sister, emails between Capano and Fahey, and the testimony of Kim Lynch-Horstmann were admitted into evidence by stipulation.\n\nIn September 1995, Fahey met Michael Scanlon while she was still involved in the relationship with Capano. After a rocky beginning in her relationship with Scanlon, she fell in love with him.\n\nFahey suffered from a serious eating disorder. Although Capano knew about Fahey's illness, and was actively trying to get her help, Fahey hid her disorder from Scanlon. She also was afraid that Scanlon would learn of her relationship with Capano, a married man, and kept this a secret from him as well.\n\nAfter Fahey began dating Scanlon, she tried to break off her relationship with Capano, who became very upset and pursued her relentlessly. In a diary entry by Fahey dated April 7, 1996, she wrote that \"I have finally brought closure to Tom Capano . . . what a controlling, manipulative, insecure jealous maniac.\" Also, one of Fahey's psychotherapists, who was treating Fahey in connection with her eating disorder (and whose bills were being paid, at least in part, by Capano) testified that, in the period between February and early April, 1996 Fahey spoke to her often about how she felt \"controlled\" by Capano. As her relationship with Capano became strained, her eating disorder became aggravated. By April 1996, however, Fahey had come to believe that she and Capano had established a friendship that she could manage while continuing to become more involved with Scanlon.\n\nThe State's theory was, and circumstantial evidence was offered to show, that Capano had already begun to plan Fahey's death. In February 1996, Capano told two of his brothers, Gerry and Joseph, a story about being threatened by one or more unidentified extortionists. Capano borrowed $8,000 from Gerry, which he paid back a few days later. This loan was supposedly in connection with the extortion. Some time after borrowing the money, Gerry provided Capano with a handgun that was returned to Gerry by May of that year. Some time between February and May 1996, Capano asked Gerry if he could borrow his boat if he needed to dispose of a body.\n\nIn April 1996 Capano purchased a 162-quart marine cooler eventually used to dispose of Fahey's body. In May 1996 Capano had his mistress of seventeen years, Deborah MacIntyre, purchase a gun for him. At trial, MacIntyre testified that on May 13, 1996, Capano drove her to Miller's Gun Center where, at his request, she purchased a handgun while he waited in the car outside. She returned to the car and gave him the gun and some ammunition. MacIntyre said she never saw the gun again. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e4\u003c/span\u003e\n\nOn Thursday, June 27, 1996, Fahey left work at about 4:30 p.m. and went to an appointment with her psychiatrist. Afterward, Capano picked Fahey up at her Wilmington apartment and drove to a restaurant in Philadelphia for dinner. Their server at the restaurant testified that they \"didn't speak to each other at all\" and that Fahey looked \"haggard and gaunt,\" and had a \"somber\" demeanor. Fahey was not thereafter seen alive.\n\nOn Friday morning, June 28, 1996, Thomas drove to his brother Gerry's house at about 5:30-5:45 a.m. Thomas asked to borrow Gerry's boat. Gerry testified that he asked Thomas, \"Did you do it?\" and Thomas replied that he had. Gerry and Thomas agreed to meet later at Thomas' house and Thomas went home.\n\nThomas took his wife's Suburban, a larger vehicle than his Jeep Cherokee, back to his house to await Gerry. By the time Gerry arrived at about 8:30 a.m., Capano had put a chain and lock on the cooler.\n\nGerry told Thomas to remove the lock and chain, and the two placed the cooler into the back of the Suburban. They drove together in the Suburban to Gerry's house in Stone Harbor, New Jersey. They carried the cooler onto Gerry's boat, and after purchasing gasoline, they took the boat approximately sixty miles out to sea and dumped the cooler over the side. The cooler did not sink, however. In an unsuccessful effort to sink the cooler, Gerry shot a hole in the cooler with a shotgun used to kill sharks. Finally, Gerry pulled the boat alongside the cooler and, after providing Thomas with two anchors, turned away while Thomas wrapped the body with the chain and weighed it down with the anchors. Gerry turned in time to see part of a human leg sink down into the ocean. Gerry rinsed out the cooler and removed the lid before tossing both back into the water and returning to Stone Harbor.\n\nThey drove back to Thomas' house in Wilmington. They carried the bloodstained love seat and rug from Thomas' \"great room\" to the garage where Gerry tried to cut up the love seat. Having no luck in dismantling the love seat, they placed it in a dumpster at a nearby construction site operated by their brother Louis, a developer. At this point, Gerry went home. On Saturday afternoon, June 29, 1996, Thomas bought a new rug for his great room.\n\nThe Wilmington Police conducted an initial interview with Thomas that Saturday night. They returned on Sunday afternoon to search Thomas' home, conducting an escorted \"walk through\" with his consent.\n\nLater that Sunday, Thomas spoke with his brother Louis and told him that Fahey had slit her wrists at his home, staining the love seat, but that she was okay. Thomas asked Louis to make sure that the dumpsters at his construction site were emptied the next day (Monday) because he had disposed of the love seat and some of Fahey's personal belongings in the dumpster. Louis ordered the dumpsters emptied on Monday even though they were not all full.\n\nIn a later search on July 31, 1996, federal investigators discovered small spots of blood on a wall in Capano's great room. The spots were compared with a sample of Fahey's blood from a blood bank through DNA testing and found to be a likely match.\n\nThe remaining relevant details of the State's case are discussed in connection with Capano's various arguments on appeal. Evidence presented in Capano's defense follows.\n\nD. Summary of Facts: The Defense Case\n\nCapano testified in his own defense that Fahey had died as a result of an accidental shooting that occurred in the great room of his house on Thursday, June 27, 1996, the night that Fahey was last seen. Capano testified that after dinner he took her back to her apartment where she dropped off some groceries he had bought for her; he then drove her to his house to watch television, arriving shortly after 10:00 p.m. Later that night, with Fahey still at his house, Capano spoke to MacIntyre over the telephone. They had a brief and unpleasant conversation in which Capano told MacIntyre that she should not come over to his house that night, as she often did.\n\nCapano then testified that several minutes later, at around five minutes past 11:00 p.m., Fahey and Capano were sitting next to each other on a love seat in Capano's great room with the television on. According to Capano, while he and Fahey were talking on the love seat, MacIntyre arrived very upset, yelling and saying things like \"Who's this?\" and \"Is this why you couldn't see me?\" Capano said he got up from the love seat and stood to face MacIntyre, who continued yelling. Fahey began to put her pantyhose back on (Capano testified she had taken them off due to the heat) and collected her shoes, telling Capano that she wanted to leave immediately.\n\nMacIntyre then pulled out a gun and threatened to shoot herself. Capano claims that he grabbed her arm to prevent her, causing MacIntyre to accidentally shoot Fahey behind her right ear, killing her instantly. Fahey was lying on the love seat. Capano claims that he and MacIntyre attempted to perform CPR on Fahey and then realized she could not be saved.\n\nIn order to protect himself and MacIntyre, Capano never called 911, an act that he referred to on the stand as \"cowardly and selfish.\" Capano testified that MacIntyre dropped the gun, and he took it, as well as the bullet clip that was in MacIntyre's car. Capano made sure MacIntyre was all right and sent her home at about 11:30 p.m. In the State's case on rebuttal, MacIntyre denied these claims and said she was not at Capano's house that night.\n\nCapano said he then cleaned up the blood and put Fahey's body in the cooler he had previously bought. Capano claimed that he went over to Fahey's apartment and arranged it to look as though she had been there. He testified that the next morning, he and Gerry dumped Fahey's body into the ocean off the side of Gerry's boat. Capano's testimony confirmed in many of its essentials the \"consciousness of guilt\" evidence put forward by the State.\n\nCapano also offered evidence to rebut the State's case based on motive and planning. Regarding his relationship with Fahey, he offered evidence that in the months before her death he and Fahey were no longer lovers but had developed a warm friendship. Emails between the two of them were offered to portray a relationship characterized by affectionate banter. Fahey confided in Capano regarding personal matters such as her therapy and would turn to him for help with items such as helping her install a new air conditioner.\n\nCapano gave innocent explanations for the evidence of planning offered by the State. He testified that he purchased the cooler as a gift for Gerry for use on his boat. He testified that he borrowed money from Gerry in order to surprise Fahey with a gift of $25,000 in cash so that she could get help for her eating disorder. He testified that he did not ask Gerry for a gun or ask to borrow his boat or mention anything about extortionists, but that these were in essence the product of Gerry's confused imaginings resulting from Gerry's drug use.\n\nIn this regard, Capano presented expert testimony explaining the phenomenon of \"confabulation\" in heavy drug users. He also testified that MacIntyre bought the gun for her own protection against his advice. To explain his decision not to reveal Fahey's fate to her family and to investigators, Capano testified that he kept silent in order to protect MacIntyre, with whom he was \"deeply in love.\" In support of this contention he offered letters written between him and MacIntyre while Capano was in jail awaiting trial.\n\nIt is against this factual backdrop that we now turn to the arguments that Capano raises on appeal.\n\nII. Preliminary Statement on the Admissibility or Exclusion of Evidence\n\nThe ultimate purpose of admitting or excluding evidence is to assist the jury's understanding of the underlying factual bases for its application of the law. For this reason, relevant evidence is presumptively admissible unless barred by constitutional restraints, statutory law, decisional law or court rules. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e5\u003c/span\u003e\n\nCourts often provide for the admissibility of certain evidence for only limited purposes when that evidence might be barred for one purpose but admissible for another. In such instances the law requires that the trial judge instruct the jury accordingly. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e6\u003c/span\u003e This procedure is calculated to provide the jury with the adequate factual base and breadth of understanding that it needs to render a fair verdict consistent with the truth, \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e7\u003c/span\u003e while striking the proper balance between relevant evidence and potential prejudice.\n\nNormally the decision whether to admit or exclude evidence rests in the discretion of the trial judge, and the decision of the judge can be reversed only for abuse of that discretion. If objection is not made, the plain error standard of review is applied. The prejudicial effect of the proffered evidence is often the determinative consideration, requiring the trial judge to make a threshold balancing of probative value and the danger of undue prejudice. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e8\u003c/span\u003e\n\nIII. References to Gerry Capano's Lie Detector Test\n\nGerry Capano, one of Tom Capano's brothers, was a crucial witness for the State. His credibility was a principal and hotly contested issue. Gerry's testimony not only established the fact that he and Tom disposed of Anne Marie Fahey's body at sea, but also was offered in support of the State's theory of a planned homicide.\n\nDuring the government's investigation of Fahey's disappearance, Gerry emerged as possibly a key government witness, but he was not willing to cooperate at first. After the government put pressure on him in connection with his alleged possession of drugs and firearms, Gerry agreed to cooperate with investigators.\n\nCapano argues that references in the testimony to a polygraph (lie detector) examination in connection with the government investigation and Gerry's cooperation undermined the fairness of his trial. Gerry testified on direct examination that: (1) Tom requested an $8000 cash loan from Gerry to pay unidentified extortionists not to hurt Tom's children; \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e9\u003c/span\u003e (2) Tom borrowed Gerry's handgun and returned it after one or two months, well before the disappearance of Anne Marie Fahey; \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e10\u003c/span\u003e (3) Tom asked Gerry if he could use Gerry's boat \"if either one of these people that was threatening to hurt his kids were to hurt one of his kids and he was to do something to them;\" \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e11\u003c/span\u003e and (4) he and Tom used his boat to dispose at sea of a cooler containing a body. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e12\u003c/span\u003e\n\nA. Gerry's Reference to the Lie Detector Test\n\nGerry testified on direct that he disclosed three of these matters to his lawyer before the police found illegal drugs and weapons in his home and before he was offered a plea agreement in exchange for his testimony against Tom. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e13\u003c/span\u003e In contrast, Gerry testified that he did not disclose the fact that he and Tom had discussed Tom's use of Gerry's boat to dispose of a body until after Gerry agreed to cooperate with the police and \"[b]efore I went and took a lie detector test.\" \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e14\u003c/span\u003e\n\nCounsel for Tom Capano immediately moved for a mistrial on the ground that Gerry's reference to the lie detector test encouraged the jury to assume that Gerry took and passed the test and was therefore telling the truth. The trial court denied the motion, ordered the unresponsive outburst stricken, and instructed the jury to disregard Gerry's lie detector remark. The court's complete instruction to the jury at this point was as follows:\n\nQ: When did you tell him [Dan Lyons] when you first changed the story that you told him?\n\nA: I didn't tell him that my brother said to me that if somebody was to hurt my kids and I had to do something to them, could we use the boat.\n\nQ: When did you tell him that last part of the story, that if your brother--about your brother asking you if he hurt somebody, could he use the boat?\n\nA: When did I tell him that?\n\nQ: When did you tell Dan Lyons that, if you did at all?\n\nA: I did tell him that.\n\nQ: And when?\n\nA: Before I went and took a lie detector test.\n\nBefore Gerry testified, the trial court ruled that Gerry could not refer to the lie detector test during his testimony, and the prosecution advised Gerry that he was not to mention the test. Tr. of 11/9/98 Office Conference, at 6-12.\n\nMembers of the jury, immediately before the luncheon break, the defense objected to the unresponsive answer of the witness to Mr. Connolly's question. The answer made reference to a lie detector test.\n\nSuch a response is inadmissible, even though the witness did not indicate whether or not he had taken such a test, or if so, what the results might have indicated.\n\nThe Courts of this state, the Federal Courts, and those of every other state, have consistently found such tests to be unreliable, and therefore inadmissible as evidence. Therefore, you are to disregard the witness' response, and you are not under any circumstances to speculate as to whether or not he took such a test, or what the results of such a test might have been. You are to in no way consider the witness' response in your determinations. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e15\u003c/span\u003e\n\nThe initial problem we note is the confusion in the record about whether or not Gerry actually took the lie detector test. In his unresponsive outburst, Gerry fixed the time of his disclosure to the government as being \"before I went and took a lie detector test.\" \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e16\u003c/span\u003e When the trial judge instructed the jury to disregard the witness' response, the trial judge said \"the witness did not indicate whether or not he had taken such a test, or if so, what the results might have indicated,\" and admonished the jury \"not under any circumstances to speculate as to whether or not he took such a test, or what the results of such a test might have been.\"\n\nWhether or not the trial judge accurately characterized Gerry's testimony, any misstatement there may have been was harmless. The testimony was stricken and there were no later references suggesting that Gerry actually took the lie detector test. We now turn to the remainder of this issue.\n\nCapano argues that the trial court abused its discretion by denying Capano's motion for a mistrial after Gerry referred to the lie detector test during his testimony. A mistrial is not automatically required, however, every time a witness mentions a polygraph test. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e17\u003c/span\u003e The trial court should grant a mistrial only \"if the reference to the test raises an inference about the result that substantially prejudices the defendant's case\" in light of all of the evidence. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e18\u003c/span\u003e In assessing the prejudice produced by such references, courts have considered a wide variety of factors, the most important of which are: \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e19\u003c/span\u003e (1) the effectiveness of a limiting instruction, (2) the extent to which the State's case depends on the witness' testimony, and (3) the extent to which the credibility of the witness is in dispute. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e20\u003c/span\u003e\n\nWith respect to Gerry's unsolicited comment, the most important factor is the effectiveness of the trial court's curative instruction. As noted above--and it is worth repeating--the trial court instructed the jury that:\n\nThe Courts of this state, the Federal Courts, and those of every other state, have consistently found such tests to be unreliable, and therefore inadmissible as evidence. Therefore, you are to disregard the witness' response, and you are not under any circumstances to speculate as to whether or not he took such a test, or what the results of such a test might have been. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e21\u003c/span\u003e\n\nOn this point, Capano argues that the court's instruction could not prevent or even discourage unwarranted inferences by the jury about Gerry's credibility from the fact that he took or may have taken a polygraph test. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e22\u003c/span\u003e As a general rule, we must presume that \"the jurors followed the court's instruction.\" \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e23\u003c/span\u003e In the present case, we conclude that the trial judge's striking of the testimony and his immediate limiting instruction was sufficient to neutralize any prejudice to the defense from Gerry's comment about his lie detector test. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e24\u003c/span\u003e\n\nB. Lyons' Testimony about the Threat of a Polygraph Test\n\nBefore the State presented the testimony of Gerry's lawyer, Edmund (Dan) Lyons, Esquire, the State requested the trial court's permission to ask whether Lyons had warned Gerry that he could be required to take a polygraph test if he cooperated with federal investigators. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e25\u003c/span\u003e The defense strongly objected. In overruling the objection, the trial court permitted the State to ask the question \"in a context which is modified to suggest the possibility of the test as opposed to the absolute fact that a test is going to be given.\" \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e26\u003c/span\u003e The testimony by Lyons on this point proceeded as follows:\n\nQ: Now, he had told you up to this point about going out on his boat with his brother Thomas and dumping a body, is that correct?\n\nA: Yes, sir.\n\nQ: He had not told you at this point about his brother Thomas asking him if he could go out and use the boat if he had to dispose of a body prior to June 28th, is that also correct?\n\nA: That's true. He had not told me that.\n\nQ: Now, when you met with him on October 30th of 1997, did you have information to the effect that Thomas had told him that or asked him that prior to June 28th of 1996?\n\nA: Yes.\n\nQ: What did you tell--specifically with respect to meeting with the federal authorities, what did you tell Gerry about whether he could or could not withhold information from the federal authorities if he made a decision to go in?\n\nA: I told him what I would tell any other client in that situation. If you make a decision to go in, you have to go in and make full disclosure. You can't hold anything back.\n\nIf you do or if you have not told me every little detail and something comes out in the course of meeting with federal prosecutors, it will come back and bite you on the rear end, and it's just crucial, and I said this to Gerry, I need to know everything before we go in because if you hold anything back, you're going to hurt yourself.\n\nQ: Did you also tell him prior to going in--did you also tell him at that meeting that he would or might be required to take a polygraph test?\n\nA: Yes. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e27\u003c/span\u003e\n\nThe trial judge then immediately instructed the jury that this testimony was admissible for only a limited purpose, namely:\n\nsolely for the purpose of permitting you to consider its impact on the state of mind of Gerard Capano at the time he made the ensuing statement. His state of mind at that time has been placed in issue and is in issue, and you are to consider the question and answer just presented solely for that purpose.\n\nThere is no evidence that such a test was administered, and you should not speculate on that since the results would not be admitted into evidence. . . . \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e28\u003c/span\u003e\n\nPutting aside for the moment the issue of potential prejudice engendered by a reference to a lie detector test, we believe that the trial judge's limiting instruction was consistent with a rational theory--namely that it was arguably preferable, on balance, for the jury to hear, with appropriate caution, an explanation of why, at that particular moment, Gerry elected to stop lying and to tell the truth. Permitting this testimony with a limiting instruction may have been considered by the trial judge to be preferable to a course of action that would leave the jury to speculate on a wide range of scenarios for Gerry's apparent epiphany, with the risk that some of the speculative scenarios could have been irrelevant and false.\n\nThe State emphasized the impact of Lyons' testimony three times during closing arguments, observing that Gerry did not disclose the conversation about using his boat to dispose of a body until after he was threatened with a lie detector test. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e29\u003c/span\u003e A key reference to this testimony in the State's summation is as follows:\n\nBut he [Gerry] told his story, his testimony, to Dan Lyons as early as April 1997, months before his house was raided. And the only piece of the puzzle he left out had to do with the defendant's request that if he killed somebody could he use the boat. That's the only piece missing. And we get that piece when on October 30th Dan Lyons, knowing that Gerry is about to come in and discuss his case with the Government, tells [Gerry] you must tell the complete truth. He threatens him with the possibility of taking a lie detector test and he says you have to tell the complete truth, you cannot hold back.\n\nI want to read you something from Dan Lyons' testimony. Remember, Dan Lyons was Gerry's lawyer and he was asked by Mr. Wharton: \"What did you tell--specifically with respect to meeting with the federal authorities, what did you tell Gerry about whether he could or could not withhold information from the federal authorities if he made a decision to go in?\"\n\nAnd Mr. Lyons responded: \"I told him what I would tell any other client in that situation. If you make a decision to go in, you have to go in and make full disclosure. You can't hold anything back. If you do or if you have not told me every little detail and something comes out in the course of meeting with federal prosecutors, it will come back and bite you on the rear end, and it's just crucial, and I said this to Gerry, I need to know everything before we go in because if you hold anything back, you're going to hurt yourself.\" Question: \"Did you also tell him prior to going in--did you also tell him at that meeting that he would or might be required to take a polygraph test?\"\n\nAnswer: \"Yes.\"\n\nHaving advised him of that, what did he do then? Then Mr. Lyons said this--he said: \"Well, I said a little bit more. I said look, you have told me everything that happened, but it is possible, and I just don't know, but it is possible that there may have been a situation in which Tom said to you I'm thinking about killing somebody or just raised the issue before June of 1996 and if you are holding that back because you just don't want to tell me or it is painful to tell me, or you want to protect your brother you are making a big mistake, because if it happened you are going to hurt yourself. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e30\u003c/span\u003e\n\nCapano contends that the trial court committed reversible error by permitting the State to refer to Gerry's lie detector test during its direct examination of Lyons. The State argues that Lyons' testimony was admissible for the limited purpose of showing Gerry's state of mind in that he agreed to disclose incriminating evidence against his brother only after his lawyer warned him that he would have to take a lie detector test as a condition of his plea agreement. Under this theory, the State did not seek to prove that Gerry had taken and passed the lie detector test; instead the State sought to prove only a \"triggering event\"--that Gerry's decision to disclose the second \"extortionist\" conversation was triggered by the threat of a lie detector test.\n\nThe State also asserts that a reference to a lie detector test raises a concern only where the reference directly or impliedly discloses the results of the polygraph. Clearly, the results of a polygraph are inadmissible. Courts acknowledge, however, that \"the only logical conclusion [the jurors] could deduce would be that [the witness] passed the polygraph test thus enabling him to complete his plea bargain with the State.\" \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e31\u003c/span\u003e\n\nLyons' testimony raises two related issues: (1) whether a reference to the threat of a lie detector test may be admissible evidence and (2) whether Lyons improperly vouched for the credibility of Gerry's testimony by testifying in his capacity as an attorney and an officer of the court that he had warned Gerry about the possibility of a lie detector test.\n\n1. Admissibility of Lyons' Reference to the\n\nThreat of a Lie Detector Test\n\nAs a general rule, and as the trial court instructed here, the results of polygraph tests are \"inadmissible for any purpose because their scientific reliability has not been established.\" \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e32\u003c/span\u003e Similarly, polygraph evidence is never admissible if it is offered to establish that a witness' version of the events is true. These rules reflect a legitimate concern that jurors will assume that the results of the polygraph are accurate and will therefore accept the witness' testimony as the truth. Put differently, the concern is that a potentially unreliable lie detector test will take the place of the jury in assessing the credibility of witnesses. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e33\u003c/span\u003e\n\nThe State nevertheless contends that evidence of the \"threat\" of a polygraph test is admissible, even if the results of the polygraph test are not admissible. Curiously, neither party in all the voluminous briefs \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e34\u003c/span\u003e filed in the case before us cites Whalen v. State, \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e35\u003c/span\u003e where we held, in the unique circumstances of that case, that a polygraph test may be admissible as a relevant fact in assessing the voluntariness of a defendant's confession. The Whalen Court reached this conclusion because the \"presentation to the trier of fact of all relevant facts and circumstances is appropriate when it must assess the totality of the circumstances\" surrounding the defendant's confession. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e36\u003c/span\u003e\n\nThe holding in Whalen preserves the rule prohibiting \"the use of the results of a polygraph test without prior agreement of the parties.\" \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e37\u003c/span\u003e We believe that any reference to a polygraph test is potentially mischievous. In fact, we cannot now foresee scenarios in which the potential for prejudice would not exist. At the very least, the trial court must apply enhanced scrutiny (in addition to a Rule 403 analysis) to assure that any references to a polygraph are necessary, of minimal prejudicial impact and that no other appropriate alternative evidence is available to establish the relevant operative fact sought to be admitted. The trial court must also formulate a clear cautionary instruction for the jury. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e38\u003c/span\u003e\n\nWhalen may not be read broadly to permit references to a lie detector test to prove a limitless range of operative facts, and it must be limited to the circumstances that were present in the Whalen case itself. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e39\u003c/span\u003e Accordingly, we do not pronounce today a per se exclusionary rule prohibiting any reference to a lie detector test, but we caution that one cannot rely on a broad reading of Whalen.\n\nThe State characterizes the \"threat\" of a polygraph test as an event like any other event that could cause a witness to change his or her testimony in one direction or the other. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e40\u003c/span\u003e But a lie detector test is fundamentally different from other events because its purpose as an investigative tool is to gauge whether a person is telling the truth. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e41\u003c/span\u003e In the presPent case, the jury may have inferred from Lyons' testimony: (1) that Gerry was not telling the truth before the threat of a lie detector test and (2) that he was telling the truth after the threat. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e42\u003c/span\u003e\n\nThe admission of Lyons' testimony relating to a threat of a polygraph test in this situation was improper because it runs the risk that a reasonable juror could infer that the witness was lying before the threat of a test but telling the truth afterward. Given the judicial suspicion of lie detector tests and the potentially prejudicial nature of the lie detector testimony described above, the threshold question is whether the trial court abused its discretion in permitting the State to elicit testimony that Gerry disclosed information in response to the threat of a lie detector test \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e43\u003c/span\u003e even for the limited purpose for which the testimony was admitted and within the context of the trial court's limiting instructions.\n\nUnder the circumstances of this case, however, we find that the trial court's admission of Lyons' reference to a lie detector test does not require a reversal of Capano's conviction. We believe there is no basis to conclude that the jury would ignore the cautionary instruction given in this case. As discussed in subsection C of this Section, we conclude that any error in allowing this testimony is harmless when viewed through the prism of the totality of the record and in light of the trial judge's limiting instruction.\n\n2. Improper Vouching by Lyons\n\nCapano also contends that Lyons' testimony taken as a whole improperly vouches for Gerry's credibility. This issue involves two related questions: (1) whether Lyons' testimony improperly attested to Gerry's credibility and (2) whether the State used Lyons' credentials as an experienced lawyer and former federal prosecutor to bolster Gerry's testimony.\n\nAt the outset, we note that the trial court admitted Lyons' testimony based on \"its impact upon the state of mind of Gerard Capano at the time he made the ensuing statement [about Tom's request to use his boat].\" \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e44\u003c/span\u003e Nevertheless, it is clear that the State presented the testimony to explain why Gerry did not disclose this information until after he began to negotiate an arrangement with prosecutors. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e45\u003c/span\u003e Thus, the credibility of Gerry's testimony was at issue, not his state of mind at the time of his final disclosure.\n\nAs a general rule, a witness may not bolster or vouch for the credibility of another witness by testifying that the other witness is telling the truth. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e46\u003c/span\u003e The State argues that the trial court did not err in this respect because Lyons did not vouch for Gerry and did not express an opinion on the veracity of Gerry's testimony. But the cases are clear that improper vouching includes testimony that directly or indirectly provides an opinion on the veracity of a particular witness. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e47\u003c/span\u003e\n\nIn the present case, Lyons testified that he warned Gerry: (1) about the possibility of a lie detector test; (2) about Gerry's obligation to \"make full disclosure\"; and (3) not to \"hold anything back\" from the federal prosecutors. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e48\u003c/span\u003e In our view, these three points made by Lyons, when taken together, created a substantial risk that the jury would conclude that Lyons' admonitions to Gerry induced him to tell the truth to the federal prosecutors and hence to the jury. It is implicit in Lyons' testimony that Lyons believed his own admonitions to have been effective. Thus, this testimony is a subtle and indirect version of vouching for Gerry's credibility.\n\nThe problem is compounded by the State's elicitation from Lyons of his credentials as an experienced lawyer and former federal prosecutor. This testimony highlights the potential that Lyons' status as an experienced lawyer may have imparted credibility to Gerry's testimony--owing not to Gerry's believability but to the credentials of the lawyer-witness vouching for him. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e49\u003c/span\u003e Given Lyons' experience with federal prosecutors, a jury would be likely to infer that Gerry did not disregard Lyons' emphatic directive to make full disclosure.\n\nIn Graves v. State \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e50\u003c/span\u003e we reversed a conviction in part because the lawyer for two prosecution witnesses improperly vouched for them. Before the witnesses took the stand, the witnesses' lawyer appeared as a witness for the State and testified that he had urged the witnesses to cooperate with investigators and to \"tell the truth.\" \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e51\u003c/span\u003e The lawyer also testified extensively about his impressive credentials and about specific honors that he received as a criminal defense lawyer. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e52\u003c/span\u003e In that situation, this Court was concerned that the lawyer's \"recital of his professional attainments and his standing in the legal community could serve but one purpose: that a lawyer of his standing would not represent clients who were not truthful.\" \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e53\u003c/span\u003e\n\nIn the present case, the State did not exalt Lyons' credentials in the same blatant manner as in Graves, but Lyons did testify that he worked as a federal prosecutor for eight years and had been in private practice since 1982. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e54\u003c/span\u003e He also testified extensively about his dealings with federal prosecutors on Gerry's behalf. This was a subtle but clearly effective method of permitting Lyons to vouch for Gerry's truthfulness in his disclosures to federal prosecutors. There is thus a concern that the jury may have inferred that a lawyer of Lyons' experience may have believed that Gerry's testimony was credible. Although it was error to permit Lyons to testify in a manner that amounted to vouching, compounded by using Lyons' credentials to bolster Gerry's credibility, the admission of Lyons' testimony was harmless in view of the entirety of the evidence.\n\nC. Harmless Error Analysis of Lyons' Testimony\n\nUnder \"well established\" Delaware law, \"[a]n error in admitting evidence may be deemed 'harmless' when 'the evidence exclusive of the improperly admitted evidence is sufficient to sustain a conviction. . . .'\" \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e55\u003c/span\u003e In this case, we must consider the effect of the references to lie detector tests and Lyons' improper vouching testimony on the credibility of Gerry Capano's testimony. The prejudice involved here \"is limited to the potential that the jury might give undue credence\" \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e56\u003c/span\u003e to the admissions Gerry made to his lawyer under threat of a lie detector test and after being counseled by the lawyer to tell the truth. In determining the effect of this potentially improper bolstering, we will consider the extent to which the State's case depends on the witness' testimony and the extent to which the credibility of the witness is in dispute. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e57\u003c/span\u003e\n\nAlthough we place emphasis on the evidence put forward by the State, our harmless error jurisprudence requires us to examine the entire record. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e58\u003c/span\u003e Our decision in Van Arsdall is an instructive illustration of the scope of the analysis. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e59\u003c/span\u003e In that case, in considering the significance of the tainted testimony in light of the defendant's admission, made on the stand at trial, as to his presence on the crime scene, we stated:\n\n[T]he reviewing Court must consider both the importance of the error and the strength of the other evidence presented at trial. . . . It is necessary to review the entire record to determine the significance of the error. . . . Ultimately, the Court must weigh the significance of the error against the strength of the untainted evidence of guilt to determine whether the error may have affected the judgment. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e60\u003c/span\u003e\n\nWe have noted that \"[a]ny harmless error analysis is a case-specific, fact-intensive enterprise.\" \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e61\u003c/span\u003e\n\nIt is undisputed that Gerry provided the State with important evidence from which a jury could infer that Capano began planning Fahey's murder long before her death and that he disposed of her body at sea. Capano vigorously contested Gerry's credibility on several grounds, including: (1) his plea agreement with federal prosecutors, (2) his drug use and expert testimony concerning \"confabulation\" of events by drug users, \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e62\u003c/span\u003e and (3) Gerry's conversation with his mother indicating that he would fabricate facts to incriminate Tom.\n\n1. Effect of Lyons' Testimony on the Credibility of Gerry's Testimony\n\nIt is clear that the State regarded Gerry as a key witness and his credibility as crucial. In closing argument, the State said that \"the most important piece of evidence is Gerry's testimony.\" \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e63\u003c/span\u003e The State also emphasized that \"Gerry solves the case\" and that \"[i]f it wasn't for Gerry and Dan Lyons, he [Capano] might have got away with it.\" \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e64\u003c/span\u003e Capano refers to Gerry as \"a critical prosecution witness\" because \"the testimony that Capano had asked him whether his boat would be available if he ever should need it was the most important evidence in the case on the issue of premeditation.\"\n\nBut the fact that Gerry was a critical witness whose credibility was pivotal is not the end of the harmless error analysis. One must place the unfortunate lie detector reference and vouching by Lyons in the context of all the evidence, particularly the other admissible evidence corroborating Gerry's testimony.\n\nAs noted earlier, Gerry testified about several issues. Most important for our analysis, he testified concerning: (1) the \"extortion story\" described below and (2) the attempts to hide Fahey's death. It is crucial to examine the extent to which his testimony on these two issues was corroborated or undisputed. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e65\u003c/span\u003e\n\nWe begin with the fact that most of the testimony regarding the immediate cover-up of Fahey's death, including the disposal of her body, is either undisputed or corroborated. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e66\u003c/span\u003e Capano admitted to dumping Fahey's body over the side of Gerry's boat. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e67\u003c/span\u003e The events of that morning are corroborated by eyewitness testimony and physical evidence, such as phone records and gas receipts. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e68\u003c/span\u003e\n\nThe State emphasized in closing argument that when Gerry came forward with his story about the cooler, it was a story that he could not prove and might invite disbelief. But the cooler finally surfaced, having been found at sea by a fisherman. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e69\u003c/span\u003e Thus, Gerry's story was vindicated, and at trial the evidence of what had happened in disposing of the body was essentially undisputed. As the State argued, the cooler \"is the ultimate corroboration of Gerry Capano.\" \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e70\u003c/span\u003e It appears to us that much of the importance ascribed to Gerry's testimony by the State is linked to this portion of his testimony, for the reason that only Gerry could give direct testimony concerning the disposal of Fahey's body in the State's case. Tom Capano in the defense case corroborated the essence of Gerry's testimony concerning the body disposal. This testimony does not, standing alone, show that Capano actually killed Fahey or how. But it does show a cover-up, and thus consciousness of guilt.\n\nThe \"consciousness of guilt\" evidence was not contested at trial. Thus, we must focus on the main element of Gerry's testimony that was disputed: the evidence of planning and, more specifically, the alleged conversations about extortionists. According to Gerry, Thomas approached him in February 1996 and asked to borrow $8,000 in cash. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e71\u003c/span\u003e Gerry testified that Tom's explanation for this request was that \"a guy and a girl\" were \"extorting\" Tom, \"threatening to hurt his kids and ruin his career.\" \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e72\u003c/span\u003e Gerry testified that he went to the bank, cashed a check, and gave Tom the money. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e73\u003c/span\u003e\n\nGerry further related at trial that in a later conversation, Tom said that he was scared that \"the guy was going to beat him up or hurt him,\" and asked to borrow one of Gerry's guns. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e74\u003c/span\u003e Tom later returned the gun unused. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e75\u003c/span\u003e Finally, Gerry testified that Tom asked if he \"could use the boat\" if the extortionists \"hurt his kids\" and \"he was to do something to them.\" \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e76\u003c/span\u003e\n\nThe State used this testimony as evidence of planning. Capano disputes Gerry's testimony on these points. The State's theory was that Thomas was thinking ahead about using Gerry's boat to dispose of Fahey's body, and feeding Gerry a story about extortionists so that Gerry would think there was a \"legitimate\" reason for this use of the boat. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e77\u003c/span\u003e According to the State's theory, borrowing $8,000 in cash was a premeditated attempt to support the extortionist story because Capano had at least $125,000 in his checking account at all times in February 1996, and over $150,000 on the day he borrowed the money. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e78\u003c/span\u003e\n\nThe State also argued that the jury could infer that Capano borrowed the gun at that time as a premeditated step toward carrying out the murder. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e79\u003c/span\u003e The State argued to the jury that Thomas later returned the gun to Gerry (and had MacIntyre purchase a different gun) because Thomas realized that this gun would be easily traceable to him if recovered after he used it to kill Fahey. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e80\u003c/span\u003e According to the State, all of this planning connected to the extortion smokescreen took place just when Fahey was beginning to truly distance herself from Capano, supplying a timely motive.\n\nThe references to lie detector tests tended to bolster the credibility of the State's planning evidence that was centered on Gerry's testimony. Nevertheless, we find that there are significant factors in the context of the totality of the State's case militating against the likelihood that these improper references constituted such substantial prejudice to Capano that we should reverse the conviction and sentence.\n\nFirst, Gerry's testimony about the extortionist story is circumstantially corroborated. The fact that Thomas borrowed $8,000 from Gerry in early February 1996 is admitted by Thomas and established by bank records offered by the State and admitted into evidence. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e81\u003c/span\u003e Capano's own explanation for the transaction appears strained and its credibility was strongly contested at trial. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e82\u003c/span\u003e\n\nSecond, as with the cash, it is undisputed that Thomas accepted a gun from Gerry. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e83\u003c/span\u003e The corroborating evidence mitigates the impact of the lie detector evidence on the credibility of Gerry's testimony. Gerry testified that after Tom told him about the extortionists, he went to his friend Jon Burris to ask whether he knew a \"leg breaker\" who could help his brother. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e84\u003c/span\u003e Jon Burris gave testimony corroborating Gerry on this point. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e85\u003c/span\u003e\n\nAnother source of corroboration of Gerry's testimony is MacIntyre's testimony that Capano told her about extortionists as an explanation for why he wanted her to purchase a gun for him. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e86\u003c/span\u003e Additionally, MacIntyre's purchase of the gun for Capano corroborates Gerry's testimony because it leads to the inference that Capano was not a passive and reluctant recipient of Gerry's gun; rather, he was actively seeking a gun by May 1996. All of this corroboration greatly reduces the prejudicial impact of the references to the lie detector test.\n\nOf significant concern is Gerry's statement that \"my brother said to me that if somebody was to hurt my kids and I had to do something to them, could we use the boat.\" \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e87\u003c/span\u003e Relatedly, this statement is the one most directly bolstered by both Gerry's and Lyons' references to the lie detector test. This is because according to both of these witnesses, it is the one statement that Gerry withheld from Lyons until he was threatened with a lie detector test. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e88\u003c/span\u003e Although the lie detector reference certainly risks enhancing the credibility of all of Gerry's testimony, this statement is the one that is directly and specifically bolstered. The State confirms this in closing argument, saying with reference to this statement:\n\nBut [Gerry] told his story, his testimony, to Dan Lyons as early as April 1997, months before his house was raided. And the only piece of the puzzle he left out had to do with the defendant's request that if he killed somebody he could use the boat. That's the only piece missing. And we get that piece when on October 30th Dan Lyons, knowing that Gerry is about to come in and discuss his case with the Government, tells [Gerry] you must tell the complete truth. He threatens him with the lie detector test and he says you have to tell the complete truth, you cannot hold back. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e89\u003c/span\u003e\n\nThus, we must weigh the impact of this statement, in light of the rest of the State's evidence, mindful of the credence that the jury may have accorded it. But, in the context of this ten-week trial, this statement was harmless when measured against the strength of the total evidence against Capano, despite the State's reliance on it. Moreover, we discuss in subsection C-3 the trial court's instruction carefully limiting the purpose for which the lie detector references were admitted.\n\n2. Untainted Evidence of Planning\n\nHaving identified the potentially tainted portion of Gerry's testimony, we next determine the extent to which \"the evidence exclusive of the improperly admitted evidence is sufficient to sustain a conviction.\" \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e90\u003c/span\u003e We must therefore determine whether, excluding Gerry's testimony that Tom had asked to borrow Gerry's boat in the event that Tom had to \"do something to\" two extortionists, the State presented sufficient untainted evidence of planning to support a conviction for first degree murder. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e91\u003c/span\u003e The State's theory, as developed in its closing argument, was that Tom's conversations with Gerry about extortionists were merely the beginning of the evolution of a plan to kill Fahey. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e92\u003c/span\u003e\n\nEven though Capano offered innocent explanations in some instances, we conclude that a rational jury could have convicted Capano based on the following evidence of planning and motive: (1) Capano's purchase of a large cooler in April 1996; (2) his purchase of the lock and chain that he used to secure the cooler top; (3) his purchase of a gun through Debby MacIntyre in May 1996; (4) his immediate concealment of Fahey's death and disposal of her body; and (5) evidence that Fahey sought to end her romantic involvement with Capano and began dating another person early in 1996.\n\nFirst, the jury heard evidence that Capano purchased a very large, 162-quart cooler on April 20, 1996. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e93\u003c/span\u003e The State presented evidence that Capano made this purchase at approximately the same time that Fahey began to distance herself from him and to become closer to Michael Scanlon. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e94\u003c/span\u003e\n\nSecond, the jury heard evidence that, at some point early in 1996, Capano purchased the lock and chain that he used to secure the cooler containing Fahey's body. Although Capano presented innocent explanations for these purchases, the State vigorously attacked these explanations in its rebuttal and closing. Capano testified that, around January 1996, he purchased a twelve-foot length of chain from a neighborhood hardware store to increase the traction of his car tires during the winter. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e95\u003c/span\u003e The State argued in its closing that it would make no sense for Capano to purchase only twelve feet of chain, without hooks, for this purpose. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e96\u003c/span\u003e In addition, the State presented testimony that the hardware stores in Capano's neighborhood had no record of \"purchases of chain over eight feet long from January of '96 through June 28, 1996.\" \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e97\u003c/span\u003e\n\nCapano also testified that he purchased the lock early in 1996 because someone had broken into his locker at his country club and because the club president had issued a letter advising members to purchase locks for their lockers. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e98\u003c/span\u003e In rebuttal, the State presented testimony from several witnesses refuting this testimony. These witnesses testified that Capano's country club did not issue a letter advising members to purchase locks for their lockers. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e99\u003c/span\u003e From the State's evidence, the jury could reasonably infer that Capano purchased the lock and chain at approximately the same time as he purchased the cooler, as part of his overall plan to kill Fahey and to dispose of her body at sea. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e100\u003c/span\u003e\n\nThird, Deborah MacIntyre testified that Capano asked her to purchase a gun for him in April 1996--at approximately the same time that Capano purchased the cooler. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e101\u003c/span\u003e Although MacIntyre was unable to purchase the gun for him at that point, she testified that Capano renewed his request in May 1996. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e102\u003c/span\u003e After MacIntyre agreed to this second request, Capano drove her to a gun shop and she purchased a handgun. MacIntyre testified that she immediately gave the handgun to Capano and claims not to have seen it again. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e103\u003c/span\u003e From evidence of this transaction, the jury could infer that Capano sought to purchase a gun that could not be traced directly to him--once again, as part of his plan to kill Fahey.\n\nFourth, the State presented substantial evidence that, immediately after Fahey died, Capano concealed her death and disposed of her body and other physical evidence. Capano testified that, at about 11:35 p.m., after he abandoned his attempts to revive Fahey after the \"accident,\" he retrieved the cooler from a crawlspace and placed Fahey's body inside. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e104\u003c/span\u003e At this point, he also retrieved a bottle of Clorox to remove the bloodstains on the loveseat. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e105\u003c/span\u003e Within approximately twenty minutes of Fahey's death, Capano drove to Fahey's nearby apartment to make a \"star-69\" call from her phone and to leave a gift and some perishable groceries. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e106\u003c/span\u003e\n\nOn cross-examination, Capano conceded that these actions, which were taken within twenty minutes of Fahey's death, were designed to give the appearance that Fahey had been at home recently. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e107\u003c/span\u003e Capano testified that he knew that Fahey was not going to work the next day, \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e108\u003c/span\u003e and thus knew that her co-workers would be unaware of her disappearance until the following Monday. At 12:05 a.m. on June 28, 1996, approximately thirty minutes after Fahey's death, Capano also made a call to the voice mail system at his law firm \"to create an alibi that I was home\" because he knew that the system recorded the time of incoming calls. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e109\u003c/span\u003e Thus Capano admits that he acted immediately and decisively to conceal his involvement in Fahey's death and to create an alibi for himself. This admission is consistent with planning, and it supports a reasonable inference that, before June 27, 1996, Capano had planned Fahey's death. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e110\u003c/span\u003e\n\nSimilarly, Capano's efforts to destroy physical evidence of Fahey's death are consistent with planning. By about 5:00 p.m. on Saturday, June 28, 1996--after Thomas and Gerry Capano returned to Wilmington from disposing of Fahey's body at sea--Thomas had transported the stained loveseat from his great room to a dumpster at a construction site run by his family. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e111\u003c/span\u003e His brother, Louis Capano, testified that Thomas asked him to have the dumpster emptied on Monday, July 1, 1996. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e112\u003c/span\u003e On June 29, 1996, less than one day after Fahey's death, Thomas placed the stained rug from his great room and various cleaning materials into a dumpster at a hotel in New Jersey owned by his family's business. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e113\u003c/span\u003e Because Capano effectively destroyed most of the physical evidence connecting him with Fahey's death in a relatively short time span, the jury could reasonably infer that his actions were the product of a pre-arranged plan to conceal her death.\n\nFifth, the State presented evidence that Fahey sought to end her romantic involvement with Capano in January and February of 1996. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e114\u003c/span\u003e The State also presented evidence that Capano did not want the relationship to end and that he was upset about Fahey's attempts to break things off between them. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e115\u003c/span\u003e This evidence supports the State's theory that Capano had a motive to kill Fahey because she rejected him and started to date another man. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e116\u003c/span\u003e\n\n3. The Trial Judge's Limiting Instructions\n\nWe also note that the trial judge twice issued limiting instructions--once during Lyons' testimony and once in the final jury charge--regarding the jury's use of the lie detector evidence in their deliberations. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e117\u003c/span\u003e These instructions limited the jury's consideration of the contested testimony and thus reduced the prejudicial effect of the testimony. The fact that these limiting instructions tended to minimize the impact of the evidence is a factor to consider in this harmless error analysis.\n\nAccordingly, we conclude that, although the totality of Gerry's testimony was critical to the State's case, the portion of Gerry's testimony that was tainted by Lyons' vouching testimony was not an indispensable or critical part of the State's case \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e118\u003c/span\u003e and that the State presented ample untainted evidence of planning to support Capano's conviction. On harmless error analysis, therefore, we hold that the erroneous admission of Lyons' testimony concerning Gerry's polygraph test and his improper vouching did not substantially prejudice the defense and that admission of this testimony does not warrant a reversal of Capano's conviction and sentence. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e119\u003c/span\u003e\n\nIV. Hearsay Testimony by Fahey's Psychotherapists and Friends\n\nThe State presented the testimony of three of Fahey's psychotherapists: a psychiatrist, Neil Kaye, M.D.; and two psychologists, Dr. Michele Sullivan and Dr. Gary Johnson. For the most part, this testimony related to two primary subject areas: the genesis and treatment of Fahey's emotional difficulties, including her eating disorder, and Fahey's relationship with Capano, including descriptions of specific incidents during the relationship. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e120\u003c/span\u003e The State also presented the testimony of Fahey's sister and six of Fahey's friends. Like the psychotherapists, these witnesses testified about their conversations with Fahey concerning Fahey's relationship with Capano and her descriptions of several incidents involving Capano. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e121\u003c/span\u003e\n\nIn his initial briefs before this Court, Capano argued broadly that all of the testimony presented by Fahey's psychotherapists and friends is inadmissible under the hearsay rules. In his supplemental briefs and in his June 13, 2001 oral argument before the Court on this issue, however, Capano specified more carefully his hearsay arguments and the evidence to which each argument applies. The State argues that all of the disputed testimony is admissible under exceptions to the rule against hearsay and is cumulative of similar evidence that was admitted by stipulation. In any event, the State argues, if there was error admitting this evidence, it was harmless error.\n\nCapano raises several challenges to the trial court's admission of testimony by Fahey's psychotherapists and friends recounting her description of specific examples of Capano's conduct during their relationship and her characterization of Capano as \"controlling\" and \"jealous.\" First, Capano argues that the psychotherapists' testimony on these topics is not admissible under the medical diagnosis exception to the hearsay rule in D.R.E. 803(4), raising a question of first impression concerning whether that exception applies to statements made for purposes of psychotherapy--as distinct from statements made for purposes of diagnosing physical ailments. Second, he argues that the statements to the psychotherapists and Fahey's similar statements to her friends are not admissible because this testimony is a \"statement of memory or belief\" by Fahey and therefore does not fall within the state of mind hearsay exception. Third, Capano argues that Fahey's hearsay statements concerning her fear of Capano, although admissible under the state of mind exception, should not have been admitted during the State's case-in-chief. Capano contends that the State was not permitted to present this testimony until the defense had presented evidence or raised an affirmative defense making her state of mind relevant. Finally, Capano argues that the admission of this hearsay testimony violated his federal constitutional right to confront the witnesses against him.\n\nWe focus first in Subsection A on the question whether, and to what extent, the statements of both Fahey's friends and psychotherapists are admissible under the state of mind exception of D.R.E. 803(3). In Subsection B, we consider whether the erroneous admission of statements under this exception was harmless error. Finally, in Subsection C, we deal separately, and alternatively, with the question whether the testimony of the psychotherapists is also admissible under the medical diagnosis or treatment exception of D.R.E. 803(4).\n\nClaims alleging that the Superior Court erred in admitting evidence are subject to review in this Court to determine whether the trial court abused its discretion. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e122\u003c/span\u003e Where the trial court determines that the probative value of evidence is not \"substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice\" under Rule 403, this Court's review is necessarily deferential because \"the trial judge is in a unique position to evaluate and balance the probative and prejudicial aspects of the evidence.\" \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e123\u003c/span\u003e Claims alleging the infringement of a constitutionally protected right are subject to de novo review in this Court. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e124\u003c/span\u003e\n\nA. Admissibility of Hearsay Testimony by Fahey's Psychotherapists and Friends under the State of Mind Exception\n\nIn challenging the admission of the hearsay testimony presented by Fahey's psychotherapists and friends, Capano raises two related issues. First, he argues that certain of the statements do not fit within the hearsay exception for statements of the declarant's then-existing state of mind. This issue centers on the elements of Rule 803(3), particularly the provision excluding \"statement[s] of memory or belief to prove the fact remembered or believed.\" Second, he argues that the trial court erroneously admitted Fahey's statements of her fear of Capano during the State's case-in-chief because the State may present evidence of the victim's fear of the defendant only in rebuttal after the defense raises an issue making the evidence relevant. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e125\u003c/span\u003e This issue assumes that Rule 803(3) is satisfied, and focuses on relevance and prejudice concerns under Rules 401 and 403.\n\nThe State contends that the contested hearsay evidence is admissible because it reveals Fahey's state of mind--that is, why Fahey wanted to end her relationship with Capano--and because it rebuts Capano's contention that they had a good ongoing relationship. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e126\u003c/span\u003e According to the State, the hearsay evidence therefore supports the prosecution's theory that Capano formulated a plan to kill Fahey because she was attempting to break off their relationship.\n\nAgreeing with the State, the Superior Court admitted the hearsay testimony under D.R.E. 803(3) because the court viewed the change in the relationship between Fahey and Capano as relevant to Capano's motive to murder Fahey and, consequently, to the State's theory of the case. The trial court thus concluded that \"[Fahey's] state of mind becomes important\" \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e127\u003c/span\u003e and that the hearsay evidence was admissible evidence on that issue. The trial court was concerned with both the State's need to present a coherent theory of the case and the fact that Capano had raised an accident defense during opening statements that the State needed to rebut.\n\n1. Whether Fahey's Statements Fall within the State of Mind Exception\n\nD.R.E. 803(3) provides a hearsay exception for:\n\nA statement of the declarant's then existing state of mind, emotion, sensation or physical condition (such as intent, plan, motive, design, mental feeling, pain and bodily health), but not including a statement of memory or belief to prove the fact remembered or believed unless it relates to the execution, revocation, identification, or terms of the defendant's will. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e128\u003c/span\u003e\n\nThe exclusion of statements of \"memory or belief\" derives from the United States Supreme Court's decision in Shepard v. United States, in which a witness testified that the victim had stated, \"Dr. Shepard [the defendant] has poisoned me.\" \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e129\u003c/span\u003e The Shepard Court held that this declaration was not admissible under the state of mind exception because it was a statement of \"memory.\" \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e130\u003c/span\u003e Specifically, the Court stated:\n\nDeclarations of intention, casting light upon the future, have been sharply distinguished from declarations of memory pointing backwards to the past. There would be an end, or nearly that, to the rule against hearsay if the distinction were ignored.\n\nThe testimony now questioned faced backward and not forward. This at least it did in its most obvious implications. What is even more important, it spoke to a past act, and more than that, to an act by some one not the speaker. Other tendency, if it had any, was a filament too fine to be disentangled by a jury. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e131\u003c/span\u003e\n\nFollowing Shepard and the text of Rule 803(3), a statement that \"I am afraid\" is admissible. This statement fits within the justification for the hearsay exception, namely, the declarant's \"unique perspective into his own feelings and emotions.\" \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e132\u003c/span\u003e Similarly, the statement that \"I am afraid of D\" is generally admissible. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e133\u003c/span\u003e\n\nThe case is different with respect to a statement that \"I am afraid of D because he is a maniac\" or \"I am afraid of D because he threatened me\" or \"I am afraid of D because he is going to kill me.\" \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e134\u003c/span\u003e Such statements are simply perceptions or beliefs a victim has of events, and their admission is not justified under the rationale for the state of mind exception. There is substantial authority holding that such statements of memory or belief are not admissible under Rule 803(3). \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e135\u003c/span\u003e Thus, the \"statement of the declarant's then existing state of mind\" would not include anything but the assertion that \"I am afraid.\" The reasons why she was afraid cannot be characterized as assertions (i.e., \"statements\") of her state of mind. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e136\u003c/span\u003e\n\nThe State argues that the hearsay evidence admitted against Capano nevertheless falls within the state of mind exception. The State also argues that, by stipulating to their admission before trial, Capano waived any hearsay objections with respect to Fahey's diary, the Capano-Fahey emails, and testimony by Kim Lynch-Horstmann. We address this fact, along with the State's argument that the trial court appropriately limited the jury's consideration of the evidence to \"the state of mind of Miss Fahey at or about the time when the alleged incidents occurred,\" as part of the harmless error analysis below.\n\nThe State maintains that it did not offer the contested testimony to prove the \"fact remembered or believed\"--i.e., that Capano actually engaged in the conduct described or that Capano is a controlling, jealous person. Instead, the State argues that it offered the testimony to prove that Fahey believed that these things were true and, as a result, wanted to end her relationship with Capano. The State therefore argues that the testimony of Fahey's friends and psychotherapists does not fall within the definition of hearsay because the testimony was not offered to prove that the events and opinions described were actually true. Under the State's theory, to the extent that the proffered testimony is prejudicial, the trial court (as the court did in this case) must determine whether the testimony is admissible under the balancing test of D.R.E. 403.\n\nAlthough one could plausibly interpret the state of mind exception to authorize the admission of testimony of memories or beliefs for some purpose other than proving the fact remembered or believed, \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e137\u003c/span\u003e this interpretation places a difficult burden on the jury. In particular, the jury must confine its consideration of the declarant's memories and beliefs, including memories of potentially serious misconduct by the defendant, to the limited issue of a person's state of mind. Under these circumstances, it is difficult for the jury to make such an abstract distinction, even when properly defined by the trial court's limiting instructions. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e138\u003c/span\u003e\n\nIn practice, the broad reading of the state of mind exception proposed by the State relies heavily on the balancing test of Rule 403 to ensure that the defendant is not unfairly prejudiced by testimony describing the declarant's memories or beliefs. Thus, where the danger of unfair prejudice from the admission of these statements substantially outweighs the probative value of the statements, the trial court may exclude the statements under D.R.E. 403. This reliance on Rule 403 presents a potential problem because it replaces hearsay limitations with the more lenient Rule 403 prejudice balance. The hearsay rule is designed to exclude statements untested by cross-examination that are insufficiently reliable due to possible defects in the declarant's memory, perception or veracity. The Rule 403 analysis, on the other hand, assumes that these reliability concerns are overcome and focuses on balancing the effects of the statement on the jury.\n\nIn view of the wide range of untested, and potentially unreliable, out-of-court statements that would be admissible under the State's broad interpretation of the state of mind exception, we conclude that Rule 803(3) authorizes the admission of hearsay statements by Fahey to her friends and psychotherapists \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e139\u003c/span\u003e reflecting her fear of the defendant (that is, her state of mind), but not the memories or beliefs giving rise to that fear.\n\nApplying the above analysis to the present case, we conclude that Fahey's description of specific events involving Capano and her opinion of Capano reflect not on Fahey's \"state of mind,\" but on her beliefs and memories of facts as she expressed them to her friends and psychotherapists. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e140\u003c/span\u003e For example, Jill Morrison testified that Fahey told her about being locked in a garage by Capano while they argued, an experience Fahey found \"extremely frightening.\" \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e141\u003c/span\u003e The narrative of this incident is not a state of mind--it is a memory of an event--and does not fall under Rule 803(3) as we interpret that rule. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e142\u003c/span\u003e In contrast, Fahey's statements that she was upset, that she was afraid of Capano, or that she intended to break off her relationship with Capano are admissible as statements revealing Fahey's emotional or mental state. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e143\u003c/span\u003e\n\nAccordingly, the evidence going solely to Fahey's state of mind was admissible. The portions of the testimony describing Fahey's beliefs or memories of facts were inadmissible.\n\n2. Whether Statements Describing Fahey's Fear of Capano May be Presented in the State's Case-in-Chief\n\nAs discussed above, the statement \"I fear Defendant\" falls within the proper scope of Rule 803(3). Due to concerns over relevancy and prejudice, however, courts limit the admissibility of such statements by victims. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e144\u003c/span\u003e The concern is that a victim's statement that \"I fear Defendant\" leads to an inference that the defendant deserves to be feared. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e145\u003c/span\u003e Courts are wary of allowing jurors to draw this inference because it may be based on subjective impressions but have great impact. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e146\u003c/span\u003e\n\nIn light of these concerns, courts have developed limitations on the admissibility of statements describing the victim's state of mind. United States v. Brown, the leading case on this issue, requires that the trial court must find a \"substantial degree of relevance to a material issue\" or a \"manifest need for such evidence\" before the court may admit statements describing the victim's fear of the defendant. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e147\u003c/span\u003e While not limiting admissibility to any predetermined set of facts, Brown observed that statements of the victim's mental state are generally admissible only to rebut the defendant's claim of self-defense, suicide, or accidental death. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e148\u003c/span\u003e The majority of courts have adopted this rebuttal requirement in one form or another. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e149\u003c/span\u003e The holding of the Superior Court in State v. Porter that a victim's statements of fear of the defendant could come in under 803(3) \"only . . . in rebuttal after evidence of accident, self-defense, suicide or extreme emotional distress has been presented by the defense\" is broadly in line with this prevailing view. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e150\u003c/span\u003e\n\nIn State v. Wood, the Arizona Supreme Court upheld admission of \"statements made by [the victim] about her fear of Defendant and her desire to end their relationship.\" \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e151\u003c/span\u003e The rationale for admissibility was as follows:\n\nThe statements about [the victim's] fear and desire to end the relationship helped explain Defendant's motive. The disputed trial issues were Defendant's motive and mental state--whether Defendant acted with premeditation or as a result of a sudden impulse. The prosecution theorized that Defendant was motivated by anger or spite engendered by [the victim's] termination of the relationship. [The victim's] statements were relevant because they showed her intent to end the relationship, which in turn provided a plausible motive for premeditated murder. In addition, [the victim's] statements were also relevant to refute Defendant's assertion that he and [the victim] had secretly maintained their relationship after July 4, 1989. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e152\u003c/span\u003e\n\nIt thus appears that Wood did not key admission solely to rebuttal of the defense case; rather, Wood recognizes the prosecution's need to present evidence that is material to the elements of its prima facie case. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e153\u003c/span\u003e\n\nIn a slightly different context, this Court has held that the State may introduce evidence of the defendant's prior bad acts in its case-in-chief only where the evidence is independently relevant to an issue or fact that the State must prove as part of its prima facie case. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e154\u003c/span\u003e Before admitting the contested evidence during the State's case-in-chief, the trial court must determine whether the evidence is sufficiently relevant to an element of the charged crime or whether the evidence must be presented in rebuttal after the defense raises an issue to which the evidence is relevant during its case-in-chief.\n\nFollowing the cases discussed above, we conclude that a victim's statements of fear of the defendant are admissible (1) during the State's case-in-chief to prove the State's prima facie case or (2) during the State's rebuttal case to counter a defense theory that places the victim's own actions squarely at issue. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e155\u003c/span\u003e\n\nApplying this rule to the present case, we find that testimony describing Fahey's state of mind was relevant to prove (1) that Fahey sought to end her romantic involvement with Capano and (2) that Capano, as the spurned lover, therefore had a motive to kill her. Since this theory of admissibility is material to a disputed element of the State's prima facie case for first degree murder (that is, intent and/or premeditation), the State could properly present this evidence in its case-in-chief. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e156\u003c/span\u003e Thus, the trial court did not abuse its discretion by admitting during the State's case-in-chief hearsay evidence that was properly admitted under the state of mind exception.\n\n3. Confrontation Clause Analysis of Hearsay Statements Admitted under the State of Mind Exception\n\nThe next question is whether the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment operates to bar admission of the hearsay statements by Fahey that are admissible under the state of mind exception. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e157\u003c/span\u003e The Confrontation Clause provides defendants in criminal cases with the right to confront witnesses who testify against them. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e158\u003c/span\u003e Where hearsay statements by an unavailable declarant are admitted into evidence, the accused has no opportunity to test the veracity of those statements through cross-examination. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e159\u003c/span\u003e Before the State may present hearsay statements against the accused in a criminal prosecution, the State \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e160\u003c/span\u003e must therefore establish (1) that the hearsay was admitted under a \"firmly rooted\" exception to the hearsay rule or (2) that the contested statements possess \"particularized guarantees of trustworthiness 'such that adversarial testing would be expected to add little, if anything, to the statements' reliability.'\" \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e161\u003c/span\u003e\n\nWhere hearsay testimony is admitted pursuant to a \"firmly rooted\" exception, it is not necessary to make a particularized assessment of the statement's reliability. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e162\u003c/span\u003e To determine whether an exception to the hearsay rule is \"firmly rooted,\" the Court must find that the statements admissible under the exception are invariably trustworthy. This finding depends in part on the longevity and widespread acceptance of the hearsay exception by courts and legislatures. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e163\u003c/span\u003e\n\nBased on the longstanding judicial precedent establishing the propriety of admitting statements under the state of mind exception, \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e164\u003c/span\u003e this Court declared the state of mind exception, as defined in Derrickson, to be \"firmly rooted\" for purposes of the Confrontation Clause. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e165\u003c/span\u003e Following this established jurisprudence, we find that D.R.E. 803(3) is a firmly rooted hearsay exception under the Confrontation Clause. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e166\u003c/span\u003e We therefore conclude that the admissible hearsay testimony concerning Fahey's emotional state is admissible under a firmly rooted hearsay exception and satisfies the requirements of the Confrontation Clause.\n\nB. Admission Under the State of Mind Exception of Fahey's Statements of Facts Remembered or Believed is Harmless Error\n\nThe hearsay testimony recounting Fahey's statements is found in the testimony of a number of witnesses. These include a psychiatrist and several psychologists \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e167\u003c/span\u003e and also several of Fahey's friends. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e168\u003c/span\u003e In addition, Fahey's emails to Capano were read to the jury, \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e169\u003c/span\u003e as were portions of Fahey's diary, which were read from the stand by Fahey's sister, Kathleen Fahey-Hosey.\n\nAs we have found, certain of the statements made by Fahey to her friends should not have been admitted under the state of mind exception because they recounted facts remembered or believed. Similarly, analyzed under the state of mind exception of D.R.E. 803(3), certain of the statements made to the psychotherapists are inadmissible for the same reason. We conclude that, whether or not the statements to the psychotherapists are admissible under D.R.E. 803(4), \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e170\u003c/span\u003e the admission of these statements, together with the inadmissible hearsay statements made to the friends, constitutes harmless error because these statements are cumulative of statements admitted under stipulation.\n\nThe following harmless error analysis therefore assumes that the statements made to psychotherapists should not have been admitted to the extent they contain facts remembered or believed. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e171\u003c/span\u003e\n\nCapano focuses on four categories of inadmissible evidence that were each presented through the testimony of one or more of the witnesses listed above: (1) the \"gift incident\" testimony that Fahey said Capano broke into her apartment at night and took back gifts that he had previously given her; (2) references to Capano \"stalking\" Fahey; (3) a discussion of Fahey's fear of being kidnapped by Capano; and (4) the \"garage incident,\" in which Capano locked Fahey in a garage for several hours while they argued. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e172\u003c/span\u003e\n\nWe agree that, standing alone, the hearsay testimony about these factual incidents is a fact remembered or believed and is outside the Rule 803(3) exception. But, crucially, some of Fahey's hearsay statements were also presented through testimony to which Capano stipulated. Specifically, Capano stipulated to the admission of three sets of evidence: (1) Fahey's diary, (2) emails between Capano and Fahey, and (3) the testimony of Kim Lynch-Horstmann. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e173\u003c/span\u003e Of course, the admission of this evidence is not an issue in this appeal, but the effect of the admission of this evidence by stipulation is critical to our harmless error analysis.\n\nThe issue is whether the erroneous admission of the four categories of evidence was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e174\u003c/span\u003e We must determine whether the State \"has proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the error complained of did not contribute to the verdict obtained.\" \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e175\u003c/span\u003e The State argues that the erroneously admitted evidence is similar to the evidence admitted pursuant to stipulation, and thus is not prejudicial. Capano argues that the four categories of evidence at issue add new and damaging detail and thus are not cumulative of the subject matter of the stipulated evidence.\n\nSpecifically, Capano argues that this evidence was \"grossly prejudicial,\" that the State had a weak case based on circumstantial evidence, and that \"to fill the void, the prosecution relied on Fahey's extra-judicial statements that Capano was stalking her and was violently jealous. . . .\" Capano supports this view by contending that in closing argument the prosecutor emphasized the theme of Capano being \"controlling and manipulative.\" Capano also argues that the statements were especially prejudicial because they came from a sympathetic victim.\n\nWe have concluded that the admission of the testimony was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt because it is cumulative of the stipulated testimony and therefore had minimal prejudicial impact. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e176\u003c/span\u003e We begin by examining the substance of the stipulated testimony. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e177\u003c/span\u003e\n\nIn her last diary entry, Fahey called Capano a \"controlling, manipulative, insecure, jealous maniac.\" \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e178\u003c/span\u003e In another entry, Fahey described Capano as \"cold\" and \"disinterested,\" stating that he \"called and was nasty,\" that he \"raised his voice at me\" and was \"furious with me.\" \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e179\u003c/span\u003e Fahey wrote: \"I was afraid he would fly off the handle again.\" \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e180\u003c/span\u003e Lengthy stipulated testimony from Lynch-Horstmann added to this depiction of Capano. Through Lynch-Horstmann's testimony, the jury heard that Fahey viewed Capano as \"angry\" and \"obsessive.\" \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e181\u003c/span\u003e According to Lynch-Horstmann, Fahey \"felt she had to escape. She was very aware that the obsessiveness of it was weighing very heavily on her shoulders. And sometimes she said I feel like I have to move out of the state to get away from him.\" \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e182\u003c/span\u003e\n\nImportantly, the stipulated testimony also described several specific incidents between Capano and Fahey, adding considerable detail to this picture of a \"controlling, manipulative, insecure, jealous maniac.\" For instance, in an email message to Capano, Fahey wrote: \"Tommy, you scared me this weekend, starting with Friday and all the calls you placed. It really freaks me out when you call every half hour. . . .\" \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e183\u003c/span\u003e Lynch-Horstmann's testimony related numerous specific incidents centering on these themes. She testified:\n\nThere was an event in Delaware that Annie was very excited about going to with Michael called--I think it was the Grand Gala. And Tom had threatened her that he was going to be there, and she was very afraid that he was going to expose their relationship at this event. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e184\u003c/span\u003e\n\nOther testimony given by Lynch-Horstmann focused on Capano's manipulation of Fahey and the volatility of their relationship. For example, she related that Fahey told her that Capano humiliated Fahey by talking about their affair to a priest at a church Fahey attended, causing her to stop attending that church. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e185\u003c/span\u003e Lynch-Horstmann also testified that according to Fahey, Capano would \"attack [Fahey's] insecurities and refer to her as white trash\" and tell her \"that she should be lucky that he's even going out with her because of who he is and what he could buy and where she came from.\" \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e186\u003c/span\u003e She testified that Capano was giving Fahey \"a hard time\" about staying at the shore in a house where other men would be staying. According to her testimony, Fahey \"called me . . . to say . . . that Capano had just left and they had had a huge fight because he did not want her going to the shore. . . . [T]his fight ensued and she was too exhausted to make this trip to the shore.\" \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e187\u003c/span\u003e\n\nWe must examine the non-stipulated, erroneously admitted hearsay testimony in light of this extensive stipulated testimony reflecting on themes of fear, harassment, obsession, and control. Turning to the first of the four categories of evidence not admitted pursuant to stipulation, Capano focuses on the prejudicial effect of what is known as \"the gift incident,\" which Capano refers to as an \"especially noteworthy\" instance of prejudicial evidence. According to Dr. Johnson, Capano came \"to [Fahey's] apartment quite late at night . . . bolted the door shut and kept her inside for, my recollection was, three or four hours during which time he yelled at her, threatened to expose their relationship.\" \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e188\u003c/span\u003e Capano then \"took many of the gifts that he had given her out of the apartment and then eventually returned them.\" \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e189\u003c/span\u003e Dr. Sullivan gave a similar account of this incident as reported to her by Fahey. She added that Fahey told her that she was too \"frozen\" to call for help, and that Capano \"grabbed her arm and pushed her against the wall.\" \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e190\u003c/span\u003e Jill Morrison, another of Fahey's friends, testified that one night \"he came up the fire escape and they had a fight and he took back the gifts.\" \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e191\u003c/span\u003e\n\nThis testimony is largely cumulative of the stipulated testimony described above. The incident itself was introduced by stipulation through Lynch-Horstmann's testimony. She testified that Capano \"tried to remove all of the gifts that he had given Annie from her apartment because he didn't want another man watching the TV that he had given her, the clothes--seeing Annie wear the clothes that he had given her, so he removed a lot of those things from her apartment.\" \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e192\u003c/span\u003e Thus the jury knew that he had come in and taken away the gifts he had given to her.\n\nCapano argues that the psychologist testimony regarding the gift incident is significantly more damaging than the stipulated testimony because it depicts Capano acting violently--breaking into the apartment, grabbing Fahey's arm and pushing her. This argument calls for a degree of parsing that is not realistic in view of the extensive amount of similar, stipulated testimony. The incident depicts Capano as controlling, angry, and ultimately menacing. As explained above, this is just what the jury had heard through Fahey's diary entries, the emails, and Lynch-Horstmann. The jury had heard that Fahey was literally \"scared\" of Capano--\"afraid he would fly off the handle again\"--and had also heard about several specific fights. Capano's argument that the \"gift incident\" testimony truly stands out from the numerous other accounts of his relationship with Fahey is not convincing.\n\nThe three other categories of evidence at issue also carry minimal risk of prejudice because they are cumulative of the stipulated testimony. The first of these is \"stalking\" testimony. This category includes the testimony of Siobhan Sullivan that Fahey said of Capano, \"He's fucking stalking me.\" \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e193\u003c/span\u003e It also includes testimony from Fahey's doctors. For example, Dr. Kaye testified that \"if [Capano] was stalking her, sending her too many emails, parking his car in front of her home and she would notice it, not want him there, then you would expect to see . . . flare-ups in the eating disorder.\" \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e194\u003c/span\u003e Capano would show up unexpectedly, so that she would fear him \"appearing at times where she wasn't ready to greet him in a public place.\" \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e195\u003c/span\u003e He would also come \"over to the house uninvited, wanting to get in, making a scene such that he was allowed in.\" \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e196\u003c/span\u003e\n\nThe stalking testimony, exemplified by the above excerpts, is also cumulative of the stipulated testimony. Apart from the characterization of Capano's actions, i.e., apart from the use of the word \"stalking\" to describe them, this testimony simply paints the same picture of obsession that was testified to by Lynch-Horstmann. The following excerpt from her stipulated testimony suffices to make the point:\n\nHe would e-mail her at work all the time, and they were kind of obsessive e-mails. . . . [Capano] [w]ould be upset that she wouldn't see him or wouldn't talk to him. At one point he threatened to commit suicide because he said he couldn't live without her. So there was a lot of pressure on Annie because he was saying--there was a lot of pressure on Annie. He was saying I left my wife so we could be together. So there was a lot about the e-mails.\" \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e197\u003c/span\u003e\n\nAs noted above, Fahey's email to Capano also reflected this theme of obsession, stating, \"Tommy, you scared me this weekend, starting with Friday and all the calls you placed. It really freaks me out when you call every half hour. . . .\"\n\nThe next category of evidence Capano focuses on is Dr. Sullivan's statement that Fahey told her \"she was very concerned about getting kidnapped\" and she thought that it was Capano who might kidnap her. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e198\u003c/span\u003e Again, in light of the stipulated testimony, the vague and isolated discussion of kidnapping is essentially cumulative and harmless. Through Fahey's diary, the emails, and Lynch-Horstmann's testimony, the jury heard repeated testimony to the effect that Fahey was genuinely frightened of Capano. Moreover, this brief testimony appears to have been coaxed out of Fahey by Dr. Sullivan, who encouraged Fahey to muse about her fears, in a way that lessens the likelihood of prejudicial impact. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e199\u003c/span\u003e\n\nThe final category of evidence involves the \"garage incident\" testified to by Morrison:\n\n\"Yes, she told me of an incident where he had picked her up and took her back to his house into the garage and locked the doors and would not let her out of the garage while they argued and he made attempts to keep the relationship together. This was extremely frightening to Anne Marie because she had a fear of being locked in small dark places, and it was very upsetting for her.\" \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e200\u003c/span\u003e\n\nAgain, this testimony is akin to the stipulated testimony. Fahey's diary, the emails, and Lynch-Horstmann's testimony portrayed Capano as a \"controlling, manipulative, insecure, jealous maniac.\" The garage incident simply portrays the type of harassing behavior that permeated the stipulated testimony, such as \"call[ing] and leav[ing] maybe 15 messages on her answering machine in a two-hour period of time, [and telling her] that she had to talk to him, why wasn't she calling him back, that he needed to talk to her.\" \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e201\u003c/span\u003e The stipulated testimony also makes several significant and detailed references to \"furious\" and \"exhaust[ing]\" fighting. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e202\u003c/span\u003e The additional detail of Fahey being locked in the garage with Capano cannot have affected the outcome of Capano's trial. The garage incident, as well as the other evidence discussed above, is essentially cumulative and therefore harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\nFinally, we note that the limiting instructions issued by the trial court reduced the risk that any of this testimony would be a basis for inferring Capano's guilt. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e203\u003c/span\u003e\n\nWe conclude that the trial court erroneously admitted under the state of mind exception hearsay testimony from Fahey's psychotherapists and friends concerning specific incidents and beliefs described by Fahey. But, in view of the extensive and damaging hearsay evidence to which Capano stipulated at trial, we conclude that the erroneously admitted evidence was largely cumulative and that the trial court's error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e204\u003c/span\u003e\n\nC. Admissibility of Fahey's Statements to Her Psychotherapists Under D.R.E. 803(4)\n\nWe now turn to the issue concerning whether the medical diagnosis exception in D.R.E. 803(4) applies to statements made for purposes of psychotherapy--as distinct from statements made for purposes of diagnosing physical ailments. Specifically, Capano argues that the trial court erroneously admitted testimony from Fahey's psychotherapists recounting her statements to them during the course of Fahey's therapy. The State responds that the exception, by its terms, applies to statements made by a patient to licensed psychiatrists and psychologists during therapy.\n\nAs an alternative holding, we conclude that Fahey's statements to her psychotherapists are admissible independently under the medical diagnosis or treatment exception set forth in D.R.E. 803(4). \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e205\u003c/span\u003e\n\n1. Application of the Medical Diagnosis Exception Rule 803(4) provides:\n\n(4) Statements for purposes of medical diagnosis or treatment. Statements made for purposes of medical diagnosis or treatment and describing medical history, or past or present symptoms or sensations, or the inception or general character of the cause or external causes thereof insofar as reasonably pertinent to diagnosis or treatment.\n\nRelying on the broad language of Rule 803(4), which neither specifies the type of person to whom a patient must make the statements nor explicitly restricts application of the exception to physical symptoms or ailments, the State argues that D.R.E. 803(4) applies to psychotherapists.\n\nCapano argues, among other things, that such a broad reading of the exception renders meaningless the requirement that the statement be \"reasonably pertinent to diagnosis or treatment\" because nearly everything that a person has experienced, including statements of fault, is relevant to psychoanalysis. Capano also argues that in treating patients, psychotherapists do not depend on the \"objective\" truth of the statements made by the patients (that is, the correlation between the content of the statements and some notion of objective reality), or even on the sincerity with which the statements are made. To ensure that the medical diagnosis exception imposes a meaningful limitation on the types of hearsay statements that would be admissible at trial, Capano contends that the exception should apply only to statements relevant to the diagnosis and treatment of physical ailments. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e206\u003c/span\u003e\n\nThe State counters that statements made during therapy are likely to be highly reliable because patients have a strong motivation to be truthful in communicating with psychotherapists to ensure an accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment. To the extent that unfairly prejudicial testimony may become admissible under a broad reading of the exception, the State maintains that such testimony may be excluded under the Rule 403 balancing test.\n\nThis argument presents us with an issue of first impression. We have concluded that the better-reasoned view is that statements to either a psychiatrist (a medical doctor specializing and certified in psychodiagnosis or psychotherapy) and a psychologist (a trained and certified professional--not a medical doctor--who specializes in psychodiagnosis or psychotherapy) may be admissible under D.R.E. 803(4).\n\nWe do not declare a general view that such statements will always--or even usually--be admissible. But if a firm foundation with respect to the qualifications of a psychotherapist and the proper professional circumstances is established, statements made to that professional by a patient voluntarily submitting to diagnosis or undergoing mental health treatment may, in the discretion of the trial court, be admissible in a given case. While in some cases statements of the patient made to the professional in the course of psychodiagnosis or psychotherapy may be unreliable, inappropriately far-ranging, or unduly prejudicial, they are not necessarily so.\n\nTo establish the appropriate foundation, the proponent must show that the statements satisfy the two-part reliability test first developed in United States v. Iron Shell. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e207\u003c/span\u003e First, the declarant's motive in making the statement must be consistent with the purpose of promoting treatment, and the declarant must be aware that the diagnosis and treatment of her ailment depend on the accuracy of her statements. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e208\u003c/span\u003e Second, doctors must reasonably rely on this sort of information in diagnosis or treatment. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e209\u003c/span\u003e Finally, the trial judge must conduct a proper D.R.E. 403 analysis and determine that the probative value is not substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.\n\nThese safeguards must be employed by the trial judge to ensure that admission of psychotherapist testimony is consistent with the rationale underlying the medical diagnosis exception: \"[A] person seeking medical treatment is unlikely to lie to a doctor she wants to treat her, since it is in her best interest to tell the truth.\" \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e210\u003c/span\u003e Limiting hearsay testimony in this manner also assures that psychotherapists' testimony about their patients is not used to circumvent the rule against hearsay. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e211\u003c/span\u003e\n\nThus, where the patient's statements and the circumstances demonstrate reliable guarantees of trustworthiness we find no supportable reason why there should be a blanket exclusion of statements made to psychotherapists as compared to the general acceptance of statements made to doctors or medical paraprofessionals for physical ailments. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e212\u003c/span\u003e\n\nIn this case, we find that the trial judge properly exercised his discretion under circumstances consistent with our holding. The qualifications of Dr. Neil Kaye, M.D., Dr. Michelle Sullivan, and Dr. Gary Johnson, the psychotherapists, were established. The professional circumstances of Fahey's diagnosis or treatment were appropriate: There is no evidence that Fahey had an improper motive in seeking help from the psychotherapists or that she believed that the success of her treatment was unrelated to the accuracy of her statements.\n\nIn addition, Dr. Kaye testified that, in diagnosing and treating patients, psychotherapists necessarily rely on the patients' statements about their relationships in treating their psychological ailments. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e213\u003c/span\u003e Although Capano asserts that Fahey's ailments themselves (such as depression, anxiety, compulsive obsessive disorder, and anorexia) undermine the truthfulness of her statements in therapy, Capano fails to show how these disorders might have actually affected her ability to represent accurately her thoughts and feelings. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e214\u003c/span\u003e Similarly, Capano argues that Fahey often failed to disclose the full details of her life to her therapists. But Capano provides no reason to question the reliability of the statements and disclosures that Fahey did make during the course of her therapy.\n\nFahey had a motive to be truthful and candid. There is no reasonable basis, therefore, to conclude that her statements were contrived or so far-ranging as to be irrelevant to her treatment or otherwise problematic. Moreover, the trial judge conducted a proper D.R.E. 403 balancing test and concluded that the probative value of the psychotherapists' testimony was not substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e215\u003c/span\u003e\n\nFinally, it should be noted that the D.R.E. 803(4) exception for medical diagnosis or treatment does not contain the same limitation as the state of mind exception under D.R.E. 803(3) regarding a fact remembered or believed. Accordingly, to the extent that the psychotherapists' testimony regarding Fahey's statements included facts remembered or believed, they are not barred under D.R.E. 803(4). Therefore, they are either admissible under this alternative basis or constitute harmless error under the analysis previously set forth in this Opinion.\n\n2. Confrontation Clause Analysis of Statements Admitted Under the Medical Diagnosis Exception\n\nAlthough the medical diagnosis or treatment exception of D.R.E. 803(4) has been recognized in its generic form as \"firmly rooted\" for purposes of the Confrontation Clause, \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e216\u003c/span\u003e the exception has not historically been extended to psychotherapists in Delaware. Capano therefore argues that the medical diagnosis exception is not \"firmly rooted\" as applied to psychotherapists. But we need not reach that issue because the alternative ground of \"particularized guarantees of trustworthiness\" under the Confrontation Clause jurisprudence is applicable here.\n\nAs noted above, the plurality opinion in Lilly holds that the Confrontation Clause may be satisfied if the proponent of the evidence carries its burden of showing that the contested statements possess \"'particularized guarantees of trustworthiness' such that adversarial testing would be expected to add little, if anything, to the statement's reliability.\" \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e217\u003c/span\u003e Reliance on this prong of the Confrontation Clause requires a showing that the \"declarant's truthfulness is so clear from the surrounding circumstances that the test of cross-examination would be of marginal utility.\" \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e218\u003c/span\u003e\n\nIn this regard, we believe that it is particularly important that the statements satisfy the general requirements for admissibility established in Derrickson. Derrickson, which applies to the state of mind exception, requires \"that the statement(s): i) must be relevant and material; ii) must relate to an existing state of mind when made; iii) must be made in a natural manner; iv) must be made under circumstances dispelling suspicion; and v) must contain no suggestion of sinister motives.\" \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e219\u003c/span\u003e\n\nIn the present case, Fahey made the statements to her psychotherapists in a natural manner during therapy sessions and--at least for the most part--did not make the statements in response to questioning. In addition, there is nothing to indicate that Fahey made the statements under suspicious circumstances or in a manner suggesting that she had sinister motives. Rather, it appears that Fahey was expressing her concerns and fears regarding her relationship with Capano to those persons in whom she regularly confided. This conclusion finds further support in the \"spontaneity and consistent repetition\" of the statements. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e220\u003c/span\u003e Fahey made nearly identical statements concerning her intentions and her emotional state to a number of her psychotherapists and friends. In short, the nature of Fahey's statements, the manner in which they were communicated, and the persons to whom the statements were directed collectively establish that Fahey was speaking candidly. We therefore conclude that the admissible hearsay testimony presented by Fahey's psychotherapists possesses \"indicia of reliability\" and \"guarantees of trustworthiness\" sufficient to satisfy the Confrontation Clause. Thus the D.R.E. 803(4) exception as applied here satisfies the Confrontation Clause.\n\nFinally, our decision to affirm the trial judge's decision in admitting the hearsay evidence is independently supported under the state of mind exception of D.R.E. 803(3) and the harmless error analysis, whether or not the psychotherapists' testimony is also independently admissible under D.R.E. 804(3). These conclusions apply both for Delaware evidentiary law purposes and for purposes of the federal Confrontation Clause analysis.\n\nV. Lesser Included Offenses\n\nCapano requested that the trial judge instruct the jury on the following lesser included offenses to the charge of first degree murder: second degree murder, manslaughter, and criminally negligent homicide. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e221\u003c/span\u003e This request was made on two grounds. First, that there was evidence refuting the State's theory of intentional killing; and second, that Capano's testimony that Fahey was shot accidentally would support a verdict based on reckless or negligent homicide. The trial court denied the request, stating that \"the State's theory produces some evidence of intent, but there isn't any evidence of recklessness or negligence in this particular case.\" \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e222\u003c/span\u003e Addressing Capano's accident defense, the trial court further stated that it also failed to provide a basis for a theory of reckless or negligent killing by Capano. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e223\u003c/span\u003e\n\nMurder in the second degree is defined as \"recklessly caus[ing] the death of another person under circumstances which manifest a cruel, wicked and depraved indifference to human life.\" \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e224\u003c/span\u003e Manslaughter is defined as \"recklessly caus[ing] the death of another person.\" \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e225\u003c/span\u003e A person is also guilty of manslaughter when the person \"intentionally causes the death of another person under circumstances which do not constitute murder because the person acts under the influence of extreme emotional disturbance.\" \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e226\u003c/span\u003e Criminally negligent homicide is defined as causing, \"with criminal negligence, . . . the death of another person.\" \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e227\u003c/span\u003e\n\nIn reviewing Capano's claim that he was entitled to a jury instruction on any of these lesser included offenses, the statute and the case law require that we determine whether \"there is a rational basis in the evidence for a verdict acquitting the defendant of the offense charged and convicting the defendant of the included offense.\" \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e228\u003c/span\u003e We review de novo Capano's claim that there was a rational basis for the requested instructions. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e229\u003c/span\u003e We have concluded that there is no rational basis in the evidence to support a charge on any of the lesser included offenses advanced by Capano.\n\nA. Contentions of the Parties\n\nCapano's argument in support of the first ground (that he was entitled to an instruction on the lesser included offenses because there was evidence tending to refute an intentional killing) is that \"[a] jury, looking at all the evidence, could have decided that Capano and Fahey went out to dinner on Thursday night, June 27th, just as they usually did, and that, later that night, a sudden and spontaneous incident, for example, an argument that raged out of control, resulted in Fahey's death, but that her death was not intended and certainly not planned.\" The premise of this argument is that there was some evidence of an \"argument that raged out of control,\" suggesting a spontaneous crime of passion, recklessness or negligence. We find no support in the record for this premise.\n\nCapano's argument rests on two related contentions. First, he contends that the accident defense he presented through his testimony does not preclude an instruction on lesser included offenses, even though it is totally inconsistent with the theory that Fahey died after an argument with Capano. Second, Capano argues that there is a rational basis for any or all three of the lesser included offenses because the jury can \"reject or accept all or part of a witness' testimony, or all or part of the State's theory of the case, or all or part of the defense case.\" Under this reasoning, the jury is free to fill in the \"gaps\" in the State's case without any evidence in order to construct a speculative scenario of reckless or negligent homicide. The State argues that by \"limiting his defense to MacIntyre's accident, Capano ruled out any argument that he killed Fahey either accidentally or otherwise.\" Although we do not agree entirely with the State's argument, we have concluded that Capano's testimony and the elements of the lesser included offenses are mutually exclusive. Also, there is no evidence in this record to furnish a rational basis for the elements of the lesser included offenses.\n\nB. No Preclusion\n\nAs noted, the Delaware statute \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e230\u003c/span\u003e expressly provides that the trial court is \"not obligated to charge the jury with respect to an included offense unless there is a rational basis in the evidence for a verdict acquitting the defendant of the offense charged and convicting the defendant of the included offense.\" In cases where a jury could rationally disregard a defendant's exculpatory testimony, that testimony does not preclude the conviction of an included offense. We have concluded that in this case, the jury could rationally disregard all of Capano's testimony that Fahey was shot as a result of Capano's efforts to grab the gun from MacIntyre's hands. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e231\u003c/span\u003e Therefore, Capano's exculpatory testimony cannot be the sole basis for precluding lesser included offenses.\n\nThis reasoning is supported by our holding in Miller v. State. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e232\u003c/span\u003e In Miller, the defendant was charged with arson in the first degree for allegedly setting his former landlord's residence on fire. The State called two witnesses, each of whom testified that they observed the defendant entering the house through a back window and exiting minutes later. Each witness also testified that he saw smoke coming from the house shortly thereafter. In addition, the State called the former landlord, who testified that he had recently evicted the defendant from the residence. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e233\u003c/span\u003e\n\nThe defense offered three witnesses: the defendant's mother, the defendant's girlfriend, and the defendant. Each testified that the defendant was \"at his mother's house at the time of the alleged arson and burglary.\" \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e234\u003c/span\u003e \"The thrust of the defense was that the defendant was elsewhere.\" \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e235\u003c/span\u003e The issue on appeal was whether, notwithstanding the defendant's exculpatory alibi defense, the defendant was entitled to a jury instruction that he could be acquitted of first degree arson and convicted of the lesser included offense of arson in the second degree. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e236\u003c/span\u003e\n\nCiting Section 206(c), we held in Miller that the defendant's exculpatory defense did not preclude a charge on arson in the second degree, and that based on the evidence the charge should have been given. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e237\u003c/span\u003e Miller stands for the proposition that a jury can convict of a lesser included even when the defendant's testimony, if believed by the jury, would result in acquittal.\n\nMore recently, in Webb v. State, we cited Miller for the proposition that the rational basis \"standard applies even where the defendant denies any involvement in the charged offense.\" \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e238\u003c/span\u003e But, in Miller, unlike the case before us, there was some evidence from which a rational juror could infer the elements of the lesser included offenses.\n\nIn support of its preclusion argument, the State cites the following language from Manchester v. State: \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e239\u003c/span\u003e\n\nIn applying Section 206(c), this Court has held that where the defense is complete innocence to a charge of first degree murder, there can be only two choices for the jury: guilty of first degree murder or innocent. Dutton v. State, Del. Supr., 452 A.2d 127, 146 (1982); Bailey v. State, Del. Supr., 521 A.2d 1069, 1093-94 (1987).\n\nWe do not read Manchester or the cases it cites as adopting a rule of automatic preclusion where the defense is complete innocence. As we observed in Manchester, \"there was no rational basis in the evidence for a charge on a lesser-included offense.\" \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e240\u003c/span\u003e Similarly, in Dutton and Bailey we held that the denial of a lesser included instruction was not error because \"there is nothing in the record which would support a jury finding under the particular instruction . . . sought.\" \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e241\u003c/span\u003e These cases rely on fact-sensitive analysis and do not stand for a rule of automatic preclusion when the evidence--apart from the exculpatory version of events offered by the defendant--would support conviction of an included offense. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e242\u003c/span\u003e\n\nC. The Evidence Here Does Not Support a Lesser Included Offense Charge\n\nWe now address Capano's contention that based on the evidence put forward by the State there is a rational basis for acquittal of first degree murder and conviction of the lesser included offenses. The State's theory of the case was that Capano planned and intentionally killed Fahey. Capano argues that even if the State did not put forward \"affirmative\" evidence of recklessness or negligence, the \"evidence purportedly reflecting intent was de minimis at best, and what little evidence there was, was equally consistent with\" the lesser included offenses enumerated above. Capano argues that the jury \"can reject or accept all or part of a witness's testimony, or all or part of the State's theory of the case, or all or part of the defense case.\" This is correct in the abstract, but it begs the question whether there is some basis in the record for inferring from the gaps in the State's case some evidence to support the elements of any of the lesser included offenses.\n\nThe State argues that no evidence was presented of recklessness or criminal negligence, and that \"the jury was not free to infer a state of mind from nonexistent evidence.\" Our independent review of the evidence at trial confirms the accuracy of the State's view. There is no such evidence. To permit the jury to find the elements of the lesser included offenses on this record would permit unguided speculation by the jury.\n\nWe hold that the evidence produced at trial does not provide a rational basis for \"a verdict acquitting the defendant of the offense charged and convicting the defendant of the included offense.\" \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e243\u003c/span\u003e If the jury rejected the State's planning evidence, concluding, for example, that the cooler and gun purchases were unrelated to Fahey, it could have returned a verdict acquitting the defendant. But, conviction on any other theory would require pure speculation by the jury concerning the manner of Fahey's death. Allowing a conviction on the basis of speculation would be inconsistent with the statute and our prior case law requiring a \"rational basis\" standard.\n\nThe possibility that Capano killed Fahey by an act that was reckless, criminally negligent, or under the influence of extreme emotional disturbance is based entirely on speculation. Although there is evidence of the disposal of Fahey's body, the parties concede that apart from the accident defense offered in Capano's testimony, there is no evidence concerning the manner of Fahey's death. Her body was not recovered and neither was any murder weapon. Putting aside Capano's accident defense, no one gave eyewitness testimony bearing on the circumstances under which Fahey died. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e244\u003c/span\u003e If the State's planning evidence and Capano's accident defense are rejected, it is possible that Capano killed Fahey in some kind of jealous rage, or some other reckless or negligent act. But these possibilities are only speculative. They are not supported by any rational basis in the evidence.\n\nCapano contends that a jury could have decided that Capano killed Fahey after \"an argument that raged out of control,\" a theory that seems to suggest that Capano acted under the influence of extreme emotional disturbance and is guilty of manslaughter. This possibility is said by the defense to be supported by evidence concerning the troubled romantic relationship between Capano and Fahey. Even assuming evidentiary support for this theory, the applicable Delaware statute places the burden on the defendant to prove that he acted \"under the influence of extreme emotional distress\" and \"that there is a reasonable excuse or explanation for the existence of the extreme emotional distress.\" \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e245\u003c/span\u003e Because none of Capano's defense was directed at satisfying the burden he must carry under Section 641, the jury could not have found \"extreme emotional disturbance\" as a mitigating circumstance. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e246\u003c/span\u003e\n\nCapano cites the 1994 Connecticut case of State v. Sivri \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e247\u003c/span\u003e to support his argument that, because the State did not show how Fahey died, the jury could infer reckless or criminally negligent acts. In Sivri the evidence showed that the victim died in the defendant's home after sustaining a bloody injury, and that the defendant attempted to conceal the death and flee the country. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e248\u003c/span\u003e Reviewing the conviction of first degree murder, the Sivri Court held that, although the evidence would support a finding of intent to kill, it would \"permit the jury to infer that there was also a possibility that 'there was a sudden or spontaneous incident . . . resulting in the unintended death'. . . .\" \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e249\u003c/span\u003e Noting that \"the evidence of intent to kill was not overwhelming,\" the Sivri Court held that the \"proof on intent . . . was sufficiently in dispute\" to warrant instruction on lesser included offenses. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e250\u003c/span\u003e\n\nSivri is distinguishable from this case. First, in this case, unlike the situation in Sivri, there is evidence of planning. The Sivri Court itself distinguished another Connecticut case where \"evidence of prior planning and preparation\"--rental of a woodchipper to dispose of the body--made the \"defendant's claim of a 'sudden confrontation . . . too speculative to put the issue of intent sufficiently in dispute.'\" \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e251\u003c/span\u003e Second, this Court's precedent suggests that we would not follow Sivri on its facts and allow the jury the same freedom to speculate based on gaps in the State's evidence. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e252\u003c/span\u003e\n\nD. Accident Testimony Not a Basis for Lesser Includeds\n\nThe second ground on which Capano argues that he was entitled to a jury instruction on lesser included offenses is that based on his testimony alone there is a rational basis in the evidence for finding recklessness or criminal negligence. Capano testified that \"Debby shot Anne Marie.\" \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e253\u003c/span\u003e He testified that MacIntyre came into the great room of Capano's house where Fahey and Capano were sitting, surprising them both. MacIntyre was enraged, apparently because of Fahey's presence, and was crying and yelling. Then she threatened to kill herself. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e254\u003c/span\u003e According to Capano, \"the left arm was coming up and I thought, oh my God, she's going to shoot herself. And so I reached out with my right hand to grab her left hand to pull the gun away from herself. And as I did that, a shot went off.\" \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e255\u003c/span\u003e\n\nThis evidence does not support an instruction on a lesser included offense. This Court has held that an accident defense is incompatible with recklessness or criminal negligence. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e256\u003c/span\u003e Therefore, Capano's account of how Fahey died does not support recklessness or criminal negligence. Capano testified that he prevented MacIntyre from killing herself. Most important, according to Capano's testimony, MacIntyre fired the gun. Capano's testimony was that his role was simply to grab her hand as she lifted the gun up. These facts do not establish any criminal culpability. We are not persuaded by Capano's argument that a jury could find that he acted recklessly or negligently by \"grabbing the arm of a hysterical woman threatening suicide and brandishing a gun.\"\n\nThis would be an entirely different case if Capano had testified in a manner consistent with a homicide committed in a jealous rage, or by recklessness, or by an act of criminal negligence. But he did not so testify. His testimony was confined to an accident scenario that involved no crime on his part. To permit Capano now to prevail on an argument that the jury could completely have disregarded both the State's evidence and Capano's testimony and to speculate on a scenario that has no evidentiary support whatsoever would fly in the face of clearly established Delaware statutory and case law.\n\nE. No Due Process Violation\n\nCapano argues that the refusal to instruct on lesser included offenses violated Capano's due process rights. Relying principally on the 1980 United States Supreme Court decision in Beck v. Alabama, and Delaware authority as well, Capano argues that because he is a defendant in a capital case he has a constitutional right to a lesser included offense instruction in this case. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e257\u003c/span\u003e\n\nCapano's argument fails because the right to a lesser included offense instruction depends on there being a rational evidentiary basis for that instruction. Beck is consistent with that rule. And its facts were significantly different from the facts before us.\n\nBeck struck down Alabama's statutory prohibition on giving a lesser included offense instruction. In Beck, the Alabama statute provided that as to capital offenses:\n\nIf the jury finds the defendant guilty, it shall fix the punishment at death when the defendant is charged by indictment with any of the following offenses and with aggravation, which must also be averred in the indictment, and which offenses so charged with said aggravation shall not include any lesser offenses. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e258\u003c/span\u003e\n\nNo such prohibition is at issue in this case. The relevant Delaware statute simply states that the trial judge \"is not obligated\" to charge on lesser included offenses unless the rational basis test is met. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e259\u003c/span\u003e\n\nIn Hopper v. Evans \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e260\u003c/span\u003e , the United States Supreme Court stated:\n\nBeck held that due process requires that a lesser included offense instruction be given when the evidence warrants such an instruction. But due process requires that a lesser included offense instruction be given only when the evidence warrants such an instruction. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e261\u003c/span\u003e\n\nHopper explicitly upheld Alabama's requirement that there be a \"reasonable theory from the evidence\" to support a lesser included offense, and held that none was required on the facts of that capital case. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e262\u003c/span\u003e\n\nWe have concluded that in this case there is no \"rational basis in the evidence for a verdict acquitting the defendant of the offense charged and convicting the defendant of the included offense.\" \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e263\u003c/span\u003e Neither Delaware law nor the Due Process Clause requires the lesser included instructions requested by Capano. Nothing in Beck or its progeny supports Capano's argument.\n\nVI. Admission of Evidence of Capano's Character and Prior Misconduct\n\nCapano argues that the trial court improperly admitted evidence of his character during its case-in-chief and during his cross-examination. In particular, he contends that the trial court should have excluded the following evidence under D.R.E. 404: (1) Debbie MacIntyre's testimony that she purchased a handgun for Capano; \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e264\u003c/span\u003e (2) Tom Shopa's testimony that Capano, while in jail, asked Shopa if he would sleep with MacIntyre; \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e265\u003c/span\u003e and (3) the State's cross-examination of Capano concerning a racist email that Capano sent to another lawyer, \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e266\u003c/span\u003e specific instances of \"indiscreet\" marital infidelity, \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e267\u003c/span\u003e and Capano's net worth. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e268\u003c/span\u003e\n\nWe review the trial court's admission of evidence of other bad acts under D.R.E. 404 to determine whether the trial court abused its discretion. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e269\u003c/span\u003e In ontrast, we review de novo a trial court's determination under Rule 404 that \"bad act\" evidence is relevant to prove something other than the defendant's propensities or that the evidence is related to a \"pertinent trait.\" \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e270\u003c/span\u003e\n\nA. MacIntyre's Gun Purchase\n\nOn direct examination, MacIntyre testified that, on two occasions, Capano asked her to purchase a gun for him and that she eventually did so in May 1996. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e271\u003c/span\u003e On appeal, Capano argues that MacIntyre's testimony about the gun purchase is inadmissible under the rule articulated by this Court in Farmer v. State. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e272\u003c/span\u003e More specifically, he contends that this testimony is inadmissible because: (1) there is no evidence that the gun was involved in Fahey's death and (2) the jury may improperly infer that possession of a gun indicates a disposition to use it. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e273\u003c/span\u003e The State responds that the suspicious nature of the purchase is probative evidence that Capano planned to murder Fahey. The trial court agreed with the State and permitted MacIntyre to testify on this issue. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e274\u003c/span\u003e\n\nIn Farmer, the Court held that a gun found in the defendant's house was inadmissible because the State had no evidence connecting that gun or that type of gun to the shooting with which the defendant was charged. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e275\u003c/span\u003e The Farmer Court recognized that the admission of a gun into evidence may be unfairly prejudicial to the defendant where admission of the gun serves only to support an inference that the defendant had a gun available to him at the time of the shooting. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e276\u003c/span\u003e\n\nIn contrast, the State's case against Capano of a planned homicide depends on evidence that he \"was assembling the wherewithal to commit a homicide.\" \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e277\u003c/span\u003e And the suspicious nature of his use of MacIntyre to purchase the gun for him is probative evidence of this planning. Although neither side produced evidence indicating that the gun purchased by MacIntyre was involved in Fahey's death, MacIntyre's gun purchase for Capano is nevertheless independently relevant to prove that he had the gun purchased as part of a plan to murder Fahey and that he sought to cover his tracks by ensuring that he was not the registered owner of the gun.\n\nThe issue, of course, is whether the jury will infer from this transaction that Capano is a bad person because he purchased a gun illegally or that Capano possessed a gun and therefore used it to murder Fahey. In Getz v. State, \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e278\u003c/span\u003e this Court established six requirements for the admission of evidence of a defendant's prior bad acts. The evidence of prior bad acts must be: (1) material to an ultimate issue; (2) admissible under D.R.E. 404(b); (3) proved by clear and convincing evidence; (4) not too remote from the crime charged; (5) not unfairly prejudicial under D.R.E 403; and (6) accompanied by a limiting instruction.\n\nBecause MacIntyre's transaction is probative evidence of planning, the dispute centers on the last two Getz elements. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e279\u003c/span\u003e The first question is whether the danger of unfair prejudice \"substantially outweighs\" the probative value of the evidence under D.R.E. 403. Although there is a danger of improper jury inferences from Capano's possession of a gun, we find that this risk does not substantially outweigh the probative value of the evidence--particularly in view of the discretion accorded the trial court to decide these issues. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e280\u003c/span\u003e\n\nUnder the final Getz prong, the parties agree that the trial court failed to give a limiting instruction for MacIntyre's testimony. The State suggests, however, that Capano agreed at trial that no such instruction was necessary. The office conference discussions on this point are not crystal clear, but it appears that defense counsel wanted to wait until MacIntyre testified before proposing a limiting instruction. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e281\u003c/span\u003e Defense counsel did not repeat its request later, apparently because counsel thought that an instruction was not necessary. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e282\u003c/span\u003e Under these circumstances, we conclude that the trial court's decision to admit MacIntyre's testimony without an instruction did not constitute an abuse of discretion under Getz.\n\nB. Shopa's Conversation with Capano\n\nTom Shopa, who was a close friend of Capano, testified on direct examination that Capano asked him to have a \"physical relationship\" with Debbie MacIntyre. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e283\u003c/span\u003e Capano argues that this testimony is irrelevant and improper character evidence under D.R.E. 404 because it serves only to support an inference that Capano is a bad person. The State contends that Capano's attempt to induce Shopa to sleep with MacIntyre is evidence that Capano sought to \"exert continuing control over MacIntyre from prison.\"\n\nThe primary issue surrounding Shopa's testimony is whether the testimony is material to an ultimate issue or whether it bears only on Capano's character. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e284\u003c/span\u003e MacIntyre testified that she initially lied to investigators, at Capano's request, about her purchase of a gun for him. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e285\u003c/span\u003e Because Capano challenged this testimony on cross-examination, \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e286\u003c/span\u003e the extent of his control over MacIntyre became a material issue in this case. Shopa's testimony does not prove directly that Capano actually exerted an influence on MacIntyre, but a jury could reasonably infer from the testimony that Capano attempted to control MacIntyre by controlling her personal relationships. We conclude that Shopa's testimony was material to MacIntyre's explanation of events and therefore did not constitute improper character evidence.\n\nAlthough the testimony does not present Capano in a favorable light, the probative value of the evidence is not substantially outweighed by the risk that the jury will infer from the evidence that he is a bad person. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e287\u003c/span\u003e As a result, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting Shopa's account of his conversation with Capano.\n\nC. Cross-Examination of Capano\n\nCapano also contends that the State improperly cross-examined him about (1) a message he sent to a colleague that included racist remarks, (2) specific instances of sexual misconduct, and (3) his net worth. The State's cross-examination questions on these topics, Capano argues, were not relevant and were unfairly prejudicial because they encouraged the jury to make negative inferences about his character under D.R.E. 404(b). The State contends that D.R.E. 404(a) \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e288\u003c/span\u003e authorizes these lines of questioning because Capano's direct examination testimony placed relevant character traits in dispute.\n\nRule 404(a)(1) expressly permits the prosecution to use evidence of bad character traits exhibited by the accused to rebut \"evidence of a pertinent trait offered by an accused.\" This rule, in conjunction with Rule 405(a), \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e289\u003c/span\u003e extends to the State's use of Capano's prior bad acts to impeach his character evidence. The question therefore becomes whether the three challenged character traits are \"pertinent\" to this case within the meaning of Rule 404(a).\n\nWe emphasize at the outset that the trial judge necessarily has \"wide discretion\" in ruling on the permissible use of bad acts as impeachment evidence during cross-examination. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e290\u003c/span\u003e Nevertheless, to be \"pertinent\" within the meaning of Rule 404(a), the cross-examination questions must meet one of three conditions. The prior bad acts must either: (1) indicate that a character witness lacks sufficient knowledge of the defendant to render an opinion about the defendant's character; \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e291\u003c/span\u003e (2) indicate that the defendant is lying about a fact that is relevant to the case; \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e292\u003c/span\u003e or (3) indicate that the defendant lied about a specific fact. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e293\u003c/span\u003e\n\nIn the present case, only the third category applies to the disputed questions because the State sought to impeach Capano's testimony on topics that are not directly relevant to the State's first degree murder case. As the Second Circuit observed in United States v. Beno, \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e294\u003c/span\u003e the State may refute a defendant's lies about specific facts (whether relevant or irrelevant to the case as a whole) because the defendant \"should not be allowed to profit by a gratuitously offered misstatement.\" The court also observed that the rules governing the State's impeachment of the defendant's character evidence do not \"suggest[ ] that once a defendant has offered irrelevant and incompetent evidence on certain specific facts, the prosecution is immediately entitled to explore without restraint and at great length any specific occurrence which might tend to create an abhorrent image of the defendant.\" \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e295\u003c/span\u003e\n\nApplying this analysis to the present case, Capano testified during direct examination that he \"wasn't prejudiced\" \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e296\u003c/span\u003e and that he was \"discreet\" in his romantic affairs. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e297\u003c/span\u003e The State responded to Capano's testimony that he was not \"prejudiced\" by questioning him about an email he sent to a colleague that described a person as a \"dot head\" who \"smelled funny.\" \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e298\u003c/span\u003e To challenge Capano's assertion that he was \"discreet,\" the State questioned Capano on cross-examination about three specific incidents in which he engaged in sexual conduct that was not discreet. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e299\u003c/span\u003e\n\nThe trial court permitted these questions because Capano had volunteered information about specific, positive character traits, and the State was entitled to rebut his testimony. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e300\u003c/span\u003e We agree with the trial court that Capano was not entitled to \"profit by a gratuitously offered misstatement\" about his positive character traits. Although the State may not use isolated remarks as a means to engage in a lengthy examination of a defendant's past conduct, the State's questioning in the present case described only four specific incidents and was limited to rebutting the specific traits described during direct examination. As a result, we conclude that the State's cross-examination of Capano about his racist remarks and his extramarital affairs was sufficiently brief and targeted to fall within the proper scope of impeachment.\n\nDuring direct examination, Capano repeatedly asserted that he accepted less pay working in the public sector than he would have received if he had worked for a private law firm. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e301\u003c/span\u003e In response, the State presented evidence during its cross-examination indicating that Capano's net worth in 1993 exceeded five million dollars. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e302\u003c/span\u003e Although the State's cross-examination was not intended to prove that his testimony was false, the State's questions undermined the apparent purpose of Capano's testimony, i.e., to show that he has a good character because he sacrificed something by accepting reduced pay in the public sector. The State's cross-examination indicated that this pay cut did not require a significant sacrifice by Capano because he was independently wealthy. Although courts generally forbid the admission of the defendant's net worth for consideration by the jury, \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e303\u003c/span\u003e the trial court did not abuse its broad discretion by permitting the State to cross-examine Capano on this topic because he described during direct examination the financial sacrifices he made to work in the public sector. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e304\u003c/span\u003e\n\nD. Due Process\n\nCapano also presents an argument that the admission of the disputed character evidence violated his right to a fair trial under the Due Process Clause. Because we have concluded that the contested evidence was admissible and relevant under Rule 404, the admission of this evidence does not constitute a violation of the Due Process Clause. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e305\u003c/span\u003e\n\nVII. Denial of Motion for Recusal\n\nIn May 1999, while this Court had jurisdiction of this appeal, but the matter had been remanded for the trial judge to decide Capano's motion for a new trial, Capano made two requests that Judge William Swain Lee recuse himself in view of Judge Lee's possible candidacy for governor and various newspaper articles highlighting his role in the Capano trial. Judge Lee denied these requests by letters to the parties, stating that his \"ability to impartially address [the pending motions] has not been affected by the trial's impact on other aspects of [his] life.\" On August 20, 1999, a formal motion for recusal was filed. Judge Lee denied the recusal motion on August 24, 1999. The next day, he issued his opinion denying the motion for a new trial.\n\nAfter several extensions of time, Capano's brief in the appeal of his conviction and sentencing was filed with this Court on February 4, 2000. Just before that filing, Capano filed a motion in this Court for a limited remand of the proceedings to enlarge the record on appeal in connection with the recusal issue. We denied this motion in an opinion dated March 17, 2000. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e306\u003c/span\u003e Instead of interrupting Capano's appeal by staying briefing on the merits in order to conduct an evidentiary hearing that might become an \"open-ended fishing expedition,\" \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e307\u003c/span\u003e we directed Capano to file a supplemental brief on the recusal issue together with his other briefing. As we stated:\n\nThe supplemental briefing should address discrete instances of judicial discretion by Judge Lee, the exercise of which may have (a) been motivated by political ambitions; and (b) influenced the outcome of the trial to Capano's prejudice. Assuming that the briefing demonstrates an appropriate issue or issues for factual inquiry, a remand on discrete issues may be necessary. If a remand becomes necessary, we will address these issues in the context of all other issues on appeal. On the other hand, we may never have to reach the issues raised by the motion, depending on the outcome of other aspects of the appeal. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e308\u003c/span\u003e We now consider Capano's argument in the context of his appeal from his conviction and sentence.\n\nA. Capano's Contentions\n\nCapano contends that Judge Lee's ambition to run in the 2000 gubernatorial contest created \"the appearance, and, quite probably, the reality that because of political ambition, Judge Lee tilted in favor of both conviction and the death penalty because they were the politically popular outcomes in this widely publicized case.\" \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e309\u003c/span\u003e Capano argues that based on the record submitted to this Court, consisting mainly of newspaper articles quoting Judge Lee, it was error for him to deny the motion for recusal, and that we should reverse the conviction and death sentence. Alternatively, Capano continues to argue for a limited remand to conduct a hearing into the factual basis of his argument.\n\nIt is necessary to examine the record on which rests Capano's argument and his earlier recusal motion. On May 5, 1999, after sentencing but while a motion for new trial was pending, a news article was published in the Wilmington News Journal under the headline, \"Judge William Swain Lee May Run for Governor.\" \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e310\u003c/span\u003e In addition, Capano cites a newspaper report containing statements allegedly made by Judge Lee indicating that Republicans had approached him during Capano's trial to encourage him to consider running for governor. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e311\u003c/span\u003e\n\nIn suggesting that Judge Lee's political ambitions create a conflict of interest, Capano places particular emphasis on statements by Judge Lee in which he acknowledges the role that the Capano trial played in encouraging his candidacy. One newspaper article reports that in a speech given during Judge Lee's later campaign for the Republican nomination, he credited the Capano case and the guilty verdict for his popularity, saying that if Capano had been acquitted, the Judge would have been seen \"as just another judge who failed to see that the system did its job.\" \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e312\u003c/span\u003e Another newspaper article reports Lee making similar comments on another occasion. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e313\u003c/span\u003e Capano argues that, given the link--belatedly acknowledged by Judge Lee himself--between the Judge's political interests and a completed trial resulting in a guilty verdict, Judge Lee cannot have been impartial when he ruled on the recusal motion and the motion for new trial.\n\nB. Denial of Recusal Not an Abuse of Discretion\n\nCanon 3C(1) of the Delaware Judges' Code of Judicial Conduct provides: \"a judge should disqualify himself or herself in a proceeding in which the judge's impartiality might reasonably be questioned.\" When faced with a claim of bias or conflict of interest, the judge must follow a two-part analysis:\n\nFirst, he must, as a matter of subjective belief, be satisfied that he can proceed to hear the cause free of bias or prejudice concerning that party. Second, even if the judge believes that he has no bias, situations may arise where, actual bias aside, there is the appearance of bias sufficient to cause doubt as to the judge's impartiality. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e314\u003c/span\u003e\n\nOn appeal of the trial judge's recusal decision, the reviewing court must determine: (i) whether, as a matter of subjective belief, the judge was satisfied that he or she could proceed to hear the case free of bias or prejudice concerning a party; and (ii) whether objectively there is an appearance of personal bias. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e315\u003c/span\u003e We must be satisfied that the trial judge engaged in the subjective test and will review the merits of the objective test. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e316\u003c/span\u003e The standard of review is abuse of discretion. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e317\u003c/span\u003e\n\nWe are satisfied that Judge Lee's decision not to recuse himself was a proper exercise of discretion. In response to Capano's first request that he recuse himself, Judge Lee determined that his \"ability to impartially address [pending] issues has not been affected by the trial's impact on other aspects of my life.\" Judge Lee maintained this position in subsequently denying a second recusal request and a later motion for recusal. These responses fulfill the first part of the Los analysis described above. Accordingly, we turn to whether there is an objective appearance of bias in this case.\n\nThe highly publicized nature of the Capano trial brought all the participants into the public spotlight, a fact that Judge Lee obviously realized. We see no basis, however, to extrapolate the reality or the appearance that Judge Lee was unable to act impartially in all matters pertaining to the guilt and sentencing phase. There is nothing in the record to suggest that political ambitions of Judge Lee affected his ability to preside impartially over the entire proceedings in this case. Moreover, as noted in our opinion of March 17, 2000, we directed the parties to identify and discuss \"discrete instances of judicial discretion by Judge Lee, the exercise of which may have (a) been motivated by political ambitions; and (b) influenced the outcome of the trial to Capano's prejudice.\" \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e318\u003c/span\u003e In our view Capano has not satisfied this burden. Thus, Judge Lee's refusal to recuse himself, \"supported by his subjective belief that he could be impartial\" \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e319\u003c/span\u003e was not an abuse of discretion.\n\nWe find that Judge Lee did not violate the provisions of Canon 7 of the Delaware Judges' Code of Judicial Conduct. Canon 7A(2) states that a judge \"should not . . . make speeches for a political organization or candidate or publicly endorse or oppose a candidate for public office.\" Canon 7A(3) prohibits judges from several forms of participation in political organizations, including \"attend[ing] political gatherings.\" \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e320\u003c/span\u003e Canon 7C states that \"a judge should not engage in any other political activity except on behalf of measures to improve the law, the legal system or the administration of justice.\"\n\nThe Delaware Court on the Judiciary has observed that \"a judge should not have to resign merely to learn whether he has a realistic chance of election. . . .\" \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e321\u003c/span\u003e Any exploratory activity, however, must be done \"in a manner consistent with the Delaware Judges' Code of Judicial Conduct.\" \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e322\u003c/span\u003e\n\nAssuming that during Capano's trial or sentencing, Judge Lee had private conversations with one or more Republican leaders concerning a possible candidacy, such conversations did not violate his obligations under Canon 7. Likewise, assuming that Judge Lee was considering a possible candidacy, there is no evidence that he did so improperly under Canon 7. The Code of Judicial Conduct does not require judges to resign immediately upon conceiving of the possibility of running for office. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e323\u003c/span\u003e Nor does it disqualify judges who have been assigned to sensitive or well-publicized cases from seeking political office. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e324\u003c/span\u003e Capano's argument that Judge Lee acted improperly in this case because he entertained political ambitions has no basis in this record or Capano's proffer on remand.\n\nVIII. Investigation of Allegations of Juror Misconduct\n\nCapano raises two issues on appeal concerning the trial court's resolution of allegations of juror misconduct. First, he contends that the trial court abused its discretion by failing to investigate a dismissed juror's allegations that the remaining jurors had conspired to have the complaining juror removed because his view of the case differed from their view. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e325\u003c/span\u003e Second, he contends that the trial court abused its discretion by refusing to dismiss a juror who participated in a conversation about the case with a juror from another trial and who initiated a conversation with Fahey's sister before the penalty phase of this trial began.\n\nA trial court's determinations on the \"mode and depth of investigative hearings into allegations of juror misconduct\" and on the remedy for such misconduct are reviewed on appeal to determine whether the court abused its discretion. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e326\u003c/span\u003e\n\nA. Juror No. 5\n\nDuring the trial, the court received two letters from the jury foreperson alleging (1) that Juror No. 5 had expressed his opinions on the case to at least two other jurors and (2) that Juror No. 5 indicated that he had already reached a decision in the case. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e327\u003c/span\u003e In response to these allegations, the court interviewed Juror No. 5 in the presence of counsel. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e328\u003c/span\u003e The trial judge informed the juror of the allegations and identified the complaining jurors. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e329\u003c/span\u003e The juror asserted that he had not expressed any opinions to other jurors and that he did not know why the jurors had made the allegations. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e330\u003c/span\u003e Nevertheless, with the agreement of all counsel, the court dismissed the juror.\n\nAfter the trial was completed, Juror No. 5 approached two of Capano's lawyers and suggested that the other jurors had conspired to remove him from the jury because he was inclined to acquit Capano. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e331\u003c/span\u003e Based in part on these allegations, Capano moved for a new trial. The trial court again interviewed Juror No. 5 and concluded that the juror's testimony was not credible. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e332\u003c/span\u003e The trial judge declined to investigate the matter further and denied Capano's motion for a new trial. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e333\u003c/span\u003e\n\nThe trial court has broad discretion to determine the extent to which allegations of juror misconduct warrant further investigation. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e334\u003c/span\u003e This policy has particular force where the defendant wishes to impeach the jury's verdict with evidence of misconduct. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e335\u003c/span\u003e\n\nIn the present case, the trial court elected not to investigate further the allegation that members of the jury conspired to have Juror No. 5 removed because he was inclined to acquit Capano. In reaching this decision, the trial judge acted within his broad discretion because he found no credible evidence to suggest that the allegations warranted further investigation. The post-trial testimony of Juror No. 5 was the only evidence of misconduct by other jurors. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e336\u003c/span\u003e Moreover, the trial court had a sufficient basis on which to conclude that this testimony was not credible: (1) The juror did not mention the alleged conspiracy during his initial interview with the court or in his 1999 letter to the court and (2) the juror misrepresented the content of his first interview with the trial judge. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e337\u003c/span\u003e Although allegations of improper pressure by other jurors are undoubtedly serious, \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e338\u003c/span\u003e the trial court did not abuse its discretion in declining to conduct a further investigation into the post-trial allegations of Juror No. 5. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e339\u003c/span\u003e\n\nB. Juror No. 4\n\nJuror No. 4 was involved in two separate incidents that raise some questions about her impartiality. First, this juror had a conversation concerning the Capano case with a juror serving on another trial. During an interview with the trial judge, Juror No. 4 revealed the general tenor, if not the precise contents, of the conversation. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e340\u003c/span\u003e Based on this interview, the trial judge concluded that the conversation was \"innocent\" and did not prejudice Capano. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e341\u003c/span\u003e\n\nSecond, Juror No. 4 initiated a conversation with Fahey's sister, Kathleen Fahey-Hosey, at a local gym after the guilt phase and just before the penalty phase of the trial began. Juror No. 4 told Fahey-Hosey that she was \"really sorry about all this\" and that the jury had \"prayed for her family\" after it came to a decision in the guilt phase. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e342\u003c/span\u003e There is no evidence that Fahey's sister made any statement to the juror on the merits of the case. When the court interviewed her, the juror also suggested that she may have already reached a decision on sentencing. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e343\u003c/span\u003e\n\nAs an initial matter, it would appear that Capano did not object to the retention of Juror No. 4 after the disclosure of her conversations with the other juror or after her contact with Fahey's sister. Although it is unclear from the record when the trial judge revealed that Juror No. 4 discussed Capano's trial with the other juror, Capano waived his objection to the retention of Juror No. 4 by failing to present the issue to the trial court. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e344\u003c/span\u003e\n\nIn any event, Capano's claims with respect to Juror No. 4 fail because Capano does not present any evidence that the juror's conversations actually prejudiced his case. To impeach a jury verdict because of juror misconduct, \"a defendant must establish actual prejudice unless defendant can show that the circumstances surrounding the misconduct were so egregious and inherently prejudicial as to support a presumption of prejudice to defendant.\" \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e345\u003c/span\u003e Moreover, indications that a juror has made up her mind on an issue before the end of the trial--despite repeated admonitions from the trial judge not to do so--do not generally require dismissal of the juror. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e346\u003c/span\u003e\n\nIn the present case, there is no evidence that Juror No. 4's conversation with the other juror was prejudicial to Capano. Based on the testimony of Juror No. 4 and on the disclosure by the other juror, the trial court could properly conclude that Juror No. 4 did not overhear information about the Capano case during her conversation with the other juror. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e347\u003c/span\u003e The trial court could therefore properly retain Juror No. 4 after her contact with the other juror because there was no risk that the juror would base her deliberations on facts outside the evidence adduced in court. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e348\u003c/span\u003e\n\nSimilarly, although Juror No. 4's conversation with Fahey's sister was completely inappropriate during the course of the Capano trial, it did not indicate an improper bias in favor of Fahey's family. The conversation was relatively brief and did not concern the facts of the case or the jury's verdict. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e349\u003c/span\u003e Evidently, the trial court and defense counsel were satisfied with the account, and they agreed to permit Juror No. 4 to remain on the jury for the penalty phase, thus waiving the claim now presented. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e350\u003c/span\u003e\n\nFinally, Juror No. 4's comment that \"I feel like I've already come to my decision on [sentencing]\" was not sufficiently prejudicial to warrant dismissal because she merely indicated an inclination in one (unspecified) direction. Although jurors are consistently admonished not to reach a decision on any issue before the parties have presented all of the evidence, the trial court has discretion to permit a juror to remain as long as the juror does not \"express[ ] a firm conclusion that the man was guilty regardless of anything.\" \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e351\u003c/span\u003e Juror No. 4, by contrast, agreed that she could \"still discuss the aggravating and mitigating circumstances and be open to being convinced by other people who are on the jury.\" \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e352\u003c/span\u003e Because Juror No. 4 did not express \"a firm conclusion\" with respect to Capano's sentence, the trial court did not abuse its discretion by permitting the juror to participate in the penalty phase of Capano's trial.\n\nThe trial court could properly find that the incidents described above did not actually prejudice Capano and that they did not taint the jury's verdict. As a result, we conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion by declining to pursue further investigations or by refusing to grant Capano's motion for a new trial on the basis of this misconduct.\n\nThe courts of this State, and the courts of many other states, go to great pains to insulate jurors from any contact even remotely related to a pending case. Indeed, it is customary practice in Delaware for jurors to wear juror identification badges during a case. It is regrettable from an institutional perspective that these juror mishaps occurred in this case. Although contact between a juror and the victim's family is improper and should not be permitted, there is no indication that the conversation was prejudicial to Capano in this case. We trust, however, that the Superior Court has instituted adequate measures and instructions to ensure that such problems will not occur in other cases in the future.\n\nIX. Questions Concerning Post-Arrest Silence--No Plain Error\n\nCapano argues that questioning during cross-examination concerning his silence at his bail hearing violated his due process rights. Because no objection was raised at trial, we review this claim for plain error. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e353\u003c/span\u003e We conclude that the questions complained of were proper.\n\nCapano was arrested on November 17, 1997 for the murder of Fahey. He was indicted on December 12, 1997. A five-day proof positive hearing was held commencing on February 2, 1998, and bail was denied. Trial commenced on October 6, 1998.\n\nIn January and February 1998, while Capano was incarcerated awaiting trial, MacIntyre was in contact with investigators. She had testified before the grand jury in September 1996 and was possibly going to be required to appear as a witness at the bail hearing and the proof positive hearing. On January 28, 1998, MacIntyre attended an interview with law enforcement officials and stated under oath that she had thrown away the gun that she had purchased for Capano. This was the same testimony she had previously given before the grand jury. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e354\u003c/span\u003e According to MacIntyre, whose testimony at trial was that Capano took and kept the gun, \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e355\u003c/span\u003e it was at this January 28th interview that she decided not to continue giving a false story to the government. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e356\u003c/span\u003e On February 27, 1998, following negotiations between her lawyers and the government, MacIntyre signed an agreement with the State. This agreement protected her from prosecution for prior false statements in exchange for cooperation with the government investigation. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e357\u003c/span\u003e\n\nDuring this period, Capano and MacIntyre exchanged letters. The content of this extensive correspondence was examined in great detail through MacIntyre's and Capano's testimony, including Capano's direct testimony. The admission of these letters is not an issue on appeal. These letters contain \"advice\" from Capano about how MacIntyre should handle herself with respect to the investigation. He told her, for example, that she was not in danger of being prosecuted for perjury, and that she should hire new lawyers for herself. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e358\u003c/span\u003e The jury could reasonably infer from these letters that Capano was attempting to dissuade MacIntyre from cooperating with the government, and to manipulate her testimony. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e359\u003c/span\u003e\n\nOn direct examination, Capano's counsel read through a number of the letters, asking Capano what they meant. This testimony was clearly intended to bolster the claim that Capano was \"protecting\" MacIntyre by not revealing her role in Fahey's death. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e360\u003c/span\u003e\n\nIn this context, the questioning of Capano regarding his post-arrest silence were proper means of impeachment. These questions and answers are part of the following exchange on cross-examination:\n\nQ: And then February 27, 1998, after you are arrested, Debbie MacIntyre signs a cooperation agreement with the Government, right?\n\nA: Yes, she does. I didn't hear the date you said.\n\nQ: February 27, 1998?\n\nA: Yeah, I don't know if that's the date she signed. I know that's the date she went in. For all I know she had signed it the day before.\n\nQ: You kept quiet at the bail hearing which preceded this, right? There was a bail hearing in February to decide whether you would stay in jail. You never said she did it, right?\n\nA: I never testified.\n\nQ: But you never said it through any means. You never told your attorneys, you never did anything?\n\nA: No, I was true to my word. I was protecting her.\n\nQ: You were protecting her. February 27th she signs a cooperation agreement with the State?\n\nA: Yes.\n\nQ: And you're in jail?\n\nA: Yes.\n\nQ: You have--according to your testimony, it's been horrible conditions that you've endured in jail, right?\n\nA: Very terrible. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e361\u003c/span\u003e\n\nThe third and fourth questions in this exchange relate to Capano's post-arrest silence. In Doyle v. Ohio, \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e362\u003c/span\u003e the United States Supreme Court held that \"use for impeachment purposes of petitioners' silence, at the time of arrest and after receiving Miranda warnings, violated the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\" The prohibition on questioning regarding post-arrest silence extends beyond a defendant's exercise of his right to silence at the time of arrest to include pre-trial silence generally. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e363\u003c/span\u003e The rationale of Doyle is that it is \"fundamentally unfair\" to use a defendant's silence for impeachment after giving Miranda warnings assuring the defendant, \"at least implicitly, that his silence will not be used against him. . . .\" \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e364\u003c/span\u003e\n\nThe questioning excerpted above does not run afoul of Doyle because it did not \"impeach the exculpatory story.\" \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e365\u003c/span\u003e The State used Capano's silence to impeach him on a discrete issue that Capano himself had raised in order to convince the jury of the veracity of his accident defense. That discrete issue is the meaning of his letters to MacIntyre and what they could tell the jury about his conduct in January and February 1998. This testimony raised a subsidiary issue relative to the alleged accident that occurred on Thursday, June 27, 1996.\n\nAs stated above, Capano used his own direct examination to explain the letters, answering such questions as, \"Now, what did you mean by protecting someone completely?\" \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e366\u003c/span\u003e In his direct testimony he methodically referenced the letters as they related to his \"state of mind\" in January and February 1998. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e367\u003c/span\u003e Therefore the State was entitled to use his silence to raise the inference that the specific \"state of mind\" he claimed to have--i.e., a protective one toward MacIntyre--was not credible. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e368\u003c/span\u003e Therefore, we find no error.\n\nFinally, even assuming that there was a Doyle violation, permitting the isolated questioning is not plain error. Capano's pre-arrest silence following Fahey's death, and his persistent efforts to conceal her death and hide his involvement, were central issues before the jury. As Capano testified, he remained silent about MacIntyre's involvement at great cost to his family and his career, even as his \"world was collapsing.\" \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e369\u003c/span\u003e Capano's effort at trial was to convince the jury that this was because he loved MacIntyre and would not betray her. Even without the questioning complained of, the jury had to confront the stark fact that Capano remained silent before his arrest despite extraordinary pressures, all in order to \"protect\" MacIntyre. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e370\u003c/span\u003e It is thus inconceivable that two isolated references to Capano's failure to speak at a bail hearing caused any prejudice.\n\nX. No Brady Violation\n\nCapano argues that the trial judge was required to disclose to the defense certain sealed documents relating to Gerry Capano's drug usage. The trial judge held an in camera review. After that review, the trial court determined that this material was Brady material because it constituted impeachment evidence with respect to Gerry, in that it contained \"information on specific episodes when Gerard purchased and used drugs.\" \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e371\u003c/span\u003e The trial court further found that \"the material is cumulative evidence of facts in evidence and of which the defense already knows: Gerard purchased and used a large quantity of drugs on a regular basis.\" \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e372\u003c/span\u003e Based on this finding, and taking into account that the documents were sealed to protect an informant, the trial court excluded the information contained in the documents.\n\nCapano's claim of a Brady violation is without merit. We review for abuse of discretion the decision of the trial court. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e373\u003c/span\u003e In this case, Gerry Capano was cross-examined at length and in detail about his history of drug use. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e374\u003c/span\u003e Other witnesses gave testimony about Gerry's drug use, including Dr. Tavani, who testified that it affected Gerry's ability to perceive reality. The additional fact that Gerry was testifying pursuant to a plea agreement, and thereby avoiding prosecution on drug-related charges, was also before the jury. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e375\u003c/span\u003e Therefore, it was not an abuse of discretion for the trial judge to exclude this evidence on the basis that it was cumulative. Because the evidence is cumulative, Capano cannot show \"a Brady violation . . . by showing that the favorable evidence could reasonably be taken to put the whole case in such a different light as to undermine confidence in the verdict.\" \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e376\u003c/span\u003e\n\nXI. Propriety of Questions During Cross-Examination of Capano\n\nCapano argues that the State asked improper questions while cross-examining him. First, he argues that the State asked him questions that the prosecutor knew were likely to cause him to invoke his claim of lawyer-client privilege. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e377\u003c/span\u003e Second, he argues that the State asked \"so-called 'were they lying' questions\" that unfairly placed him in the position of having to argue that other witnesses had lied. We find no merit to either of these arguments.\n\nAs to the first category of claimed error, Capano concedes that no objection was raised at trial and that therefore this Court must apply plain error review. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e378\u003c/span\u003e On cross-examination, the State tried to demonstrate Capano's manipulation and control of Debbie MacIntyre. To that end, the State sought to establish that, while incarcerated, Capano asked MacIntyre to fire her own lawyers and hire a lawyer named Jack Willard recommended by Capano. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e379\u003c/span\u003e\n\nApparently Willard had represented Capano at some point. It was in this connection that Capano was asked whether Willard had asserted lawyer-client privilege on Capano's behalf. Capano repeatedly insisted that Willard had not been his attorney at the time Capano tried to get MacIntyre to hire him. The State was merely attempting to rebut Capano on this point by showing that Willard had in fact invoked lawyer-client privilege on behalf of Capano. No adverse inference was drawn from these questions. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e380\u003c/span\u003e In this context the questions were not improper because they were intended to explore the Capano-Willard relationship.\n\nCapano also complains of another group of questions in which the prosecutor asked Capano whether he had lied to his lawyers. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e381\u003c/span\u003e As Capano concedes, these questions related to false information that he fed his lawyers for public dissemination following Fahey's disappearance while her fate was still unknown. For example, Capano caused his lawyers to issue a press release describing Capano as \"devastated\" by her disappearance and \"hop[ing] she will be found safe.\" \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e382\u003c/span\u003e Capano was asked whether these statements were, in effect, \"lies\" he told to his attorneys. They did not require him to invoke lawyer-client privilege since they related to information that Capano told his lawyers for the purpose of making the information public. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e383\u003c/span\u003e Therefore they were not improper.\n\nCapano next complains of certain questions he refers to as \"were they lying questions.\" Such questions may be problematic for the reason that opinions about who is lying and who is not invade the province of the jury \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e384\u003c/span\u003e or for the reason that it is \"misleading and unfair to make it appear that an acquittal requires the conclusion that [a witness] is lying.\" \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e385\u003c/span\u003e Some courts, however, have found that \"were they lying\" questions are not always improper. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e386\u003c/span\u003e\n\nDelaware has not adopted a general prohibition on the type of questions at issue here, and we decline to do so now. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e387\u003c/span\u003e In this case the questions were not improper and do not warrant a new trial. For instance, Gerry's neighbor Jeffrey Stape testified that he saw Capano parked outside of Gerry's home on the morning of Friday, June 28, 1996, the day that Fahey's body was disposed of at sea. Capano was asked whether Stape had been \"mistaken\" when he testified that Capano glanced quickly away when Stape spotted him parked in front of Gerry's home the day after the alleged murder. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e388\u003c/span\u003e This question was about perception more than credibility, and in any event related to a minor fact. There was certainly nothing improper about this question.\n\nCapano was asked whether he had ever told either Fahey or Kim Lynch-Horstmann (a friend of Fahey) that one of his daughters needed brain surgery. Capano said that he had not. The prosecutor then said: \"Kim Horstmann is confused. Anne Marie Fahey is lying to her psychiatrist. And you are to be believed?\" \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e389\u003c/span\u003e This question, however, came after Capano had just testified that the State's contention was a \"lie\" and that Lynch-Horstmann was \"confused.\" \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e390\u003c/span\u003e In addition, we note that the question did not force Capano to comment directly on Fahey's credibility; rather, Capano asserted in his answer that Fahey's psychiatrist was not believable when she recorded the information. Therefore this questioning was not improper.\n\nFinally, Capano was asked whether his brother Joseph was lying under oath when he stated that he had asked Capano, \"Why didn't you do something about the extortion?\" \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e391\u003c/span\u003e Capano answered by saying \"it's possible that he made a mistake,\" \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e392\u003c/span\u003e a response that demonstrates the harmlessness of the question. Finally, we note that throughout the trial Capano himself labeled other witnesses as liars, asserting, for example, that both MacIntyre and Gerry had no credibility. For the foregoing reasons, the trial court's allowing the questions complained of on appeal was not error and does not warrant a new trial.\n\nXII. Personal Opinions of Witnesses as to Capano's Guilt\n\nOn direct examination, Brian Fahey, the victim's brother, testified that the Fahey family had filed a civil suit against Capano because they \"believed at the time that Tom Capano murdered my sister.\" \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e393\u003c/span\u003e He also said that Capano \"was responsible for causing my family a great deal of pain, for killing my sister . . . .\" \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e394\u003c/span\u003e Nicholas Perillo, a convicted felon who asserted that Capano had asked him to find someone to burglarize MacIntyre's home, read into evidence his statement to prosecutors that \"Jesus, I think the bastard killed her.\" \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e395\u003c/span\u003e Capano did not object to these statements at trial. On appeal, he contends that admission of these personal opinions as to Capano's guilt was plain error.\n\nNeither of these statements jeopardized Capano's right to a fair trial. It is apparent from Brian Fahey's testimony that he had no personal knowledge of what had happened to his sister, Anne Marie. Perillo was a convict, and by virtue of his testimony he was a \"jailhouse snitch,\" to use the State's phrase. These opinions do not invite the kind of deference that risks depriving Capano of the right to have the jury make the ultimate determination of his guilt or innocence. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e396\u003c/span\u003e Therefore, even assuming that admission of these statements would have been error in the context in which they were admitted if there had been a timely objection by Capano's counsel, Capano was not, in fact, prejudiced and their admission was not plain error.\n\nXIII. Capano's Absence from Office Conferences\n\nCapano contends that he was denied his right to be present at all stages of the trial because he was absent from the daily office conferences at which counsel presented evidentiary and other legal matters to the trial judge for decision. Because Capano failed to raise an objection at trial concerning his absence from office conferences, the plain error standard of review applies. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e397\u003c/span\u003e As a result, the issue is deemed waived unless the error is \"so clearly prejudicial to substantial rights as to jeopardize the fairness and integrity of the trial process.\" \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e398\u003c/span\u003e\n\nA defendant in a criminal case has a right to be present at trial based on the Sixth Amendment right to confront one's accusers and the common law \"privilege of presence\" during trial. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e399\u003c/span\u003e In Delaware, this right has been enshrined in Superior Court Criminal Rule 43. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e400\u003c/span\u003e As Superior Court Criminal Rule 43 indicates, however, the right to be present at trial has definite boundaries. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e401\u003c/span\u003e For present purposes, we need note only that Rule 43(c)(3) explicitly states that a defendant's presence is not required \"[a]t a conference or argument upon a question of law.\" Similarly, in United States v. Smith, \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e402\u003c/span\u003e the Third Circuit defined the scope of a defendant's right to be present at proceedings related to trial:\n\nDue process mandates that a criminal defendant have an opportunity to attend any proceeding where his presence has a 'relation, reasonably substantial, to the fullness of his opportunity to defend against the charge.' A defendant's presence is a condition of due process, however, only 'to the extent that a fair and just hearing would be thwarted by his absence.' \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e403\u003c/span\u003e\n\nBecause Rule 43 does not require the defendant's presence at office conferences concerning legal issues and because there is no basis to conclude that Capano's absence \"thwarted\" the fairness of his trial, we find that Capano's absence from the conferences did not violate his Sixth Amendment rights.\n\nFurthermore, because Capano does not allege that he was absent during the \"traditional and formal confrontation stage of the trial,\" he must show that he suffered some prejudice as a result of his absence. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e404\u003c/span\u003e Capano has shown no such prejudice. Although Capano was notified of the office conferences, \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e405\u003c/span\u003e he presents no explanation for his failure to attend them. As a consequence, we conclude that Capano's absence from the conferences was voluntary. Apart from a general suggestion that Capano could have \"contributed\" to the conferences, there is no argument that his presence would have affected the outcome of the trial or that he was otherwise prejudiced.\n\nWe conclude that Capano's absence from the office conferences did not violate his constitutional rights and that Capano cannot show that he suffered prejudice as a result of his absence from the conferences.\n\nXIV. Admission of Adultery Evidence During Impeachment\n\nCapano contends that the trial court permitted the State to impeach defense witnesses' testimony with evidence of marital infidelity but did not permit the defense to impeach the testimony of a prosecution witness with evidence of infidelity. For example, Capano argues that the trial court did not permit the defense to cross-examine a prosecution witness about his extramarital affairs as a means to undermine an inference that Capano arranged for the witness to sleep with Deborah MacIntyre. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e406\u003c/span\u003e In contrast, the court permitted the defense to cross-examine Gerry Capano about his extramarital affairs to undermine his credibility, \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e407\u003c/span\u003e and the court permitted the State to cross-examine Tom Capano about incidents involving marital infidelity to rebut Tom's assertion that he was \"discreet.\" \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e408\u003c/span\u003e Decisions on admissibility are reviewed under an abuse of discretion standard. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e409\u003c/span\u003e\n\nCapano's argument that the trial court ruled inconsistently on these issues fails for two reasons. First, the trial court did not prevent defense counsel from questioning State's witness Keith Brady about extramarital affairs. To the contrary, the court permitted defense counsel to ask Brady \"whether or not you have been involved in other adulterous relationships and how many\" in order to impeach Brady's credibility. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e410\u003c/span\u003e The court did, however, limit the extent to which the defense could describe the details of these affairs because such details were not relevant to Brady's credibility. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e411\u003c/span\u003e\n\nSecond, although the court limited the cross-examination of Brady by prohibiting the disclosure of the details of his extramarital affairs, this limitation does not conflict with the court's later ruling that the State could cross-examine Capano concerning specific instances of marital infidelity. Applying D.R.E. 404(a)(1), the trial court permitted the State to discuss particular sexual encounters to impeach Capano's direct examination testimony that he was \"discreet\" in conducting his extramarital affairs. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e412\u003c/span\u003e In exercising his discretion, the trial judge could properly conclude that the impeachment of the credibility of a witness by reference to extramarital affairs does not require disclosure of the details of those affairs, whereas the impeachment of Capano's specific assertion that he was \"discreet\" does require the limited disclosure of such details.\n\nWe therefore conclude that the trial court neither erred nor ruled inconsistently on these issues.\n\nXV. Plain Error--Limits on Allocution\n\nA. Introduction\n\nUnder the Delaware death penalty statute, where the defendant pleads not guilty in a capital case and does not waive trial by jury, there must be a trial to determine guilt. If the jury in the guilt phase unanimously renders a verdict of guilty of first degree murder, the same trial judge and jury will then turn to the separate penalty phase hearing. At the penalty phase, evidence is presented relating to mitigating and aggravating circumstances. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e413\u003c/span\u003e At the conclusion of the hearing, the jury will report to the trial judge whether the evidence shows beyond a reasonable doubt the existence of at least one statutory aggravating circumstance (e.g., premeditation and the result of substantial planning) and whether, by a preponderance of the evidence, the aggravating circumstances outweigh the mitigating circumstances. The jury report carries with it the final tally by number of affirmative and negative votes cast by the jury on each question. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e414\u003c/span\u003e\n\nSignificantly, the statute also provides that the defendant has the right personally to address the jury in summation in addition to having counsel address the jury in summation on the defendant's behalf:\n\nAt the hearing the Court shall permit argument by the State, the defendant and/or the defendant's counsel, on the punishment to be imposed. Such argument shall consist of opening statements by each, unless waived, opening summation by the State, rebuttal summation by the defendant and/or the defendant's counsel and closing summation by the State. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e415\u003c/span\u003e\n\nThis statutory provision is complementary to the requirement of the Rules of Criminal Procedure of the Superior Court:\n\nBefore imposing sentence, the court shall . . .\n\n(C) Address the defendant personally and determine if the defendant wishes to make a statement and to present any information in mitigation of the evidence. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e416\u003c/span\u003e\n\nThese statutory and rule provisions are, on their face, broad and open-ended in establishing the framework of the right of allocution belonging to a defendant facing the death penalty personally to address the jury and/or the judge before the determination of the penalty. It is important to focus on the fact that the right of allocution does not involve sworn testimony by the defendant nor does it subject the defendant to cross-examination. Black's Law Dictionary defines allocution as follows:\n\nallocution . . . 1. A trial judge's formal address to a convicted defendant, asking him or her to speak in mitigation of the sentence to be imposed. ° This address is required under Fed. R. Crim. P. 32(c)(3)(C). 2. An unsworn statement from a convicted defendant to the sentencing judge or jury in which the defendant can ask for mercy, explain his or her conduct, apologize for the crime, or say anything else in an effort to lessen the impending sentence. ° This statement is not subject to cross-examination. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e417\u003c/span\u003e\n\nUnder Delaware law, the function of the jury in the penalty phase is solely advisory. It is the judge who has the ultimate responsibility to impose either a death sentence or a sentence of life imprisonment without benefit of probation or parole or any other reduction. But the judge must consider and give substantial weight to the recommendation of the jury before imposing sentence. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e418\u003c/span\u003e The jury's recommendation is significant, and therefore the conduct of the penalty phase hearing must be conducted fairly. Accordingly, the nature and scope of the right of the defendant personally to address the jury in allocution is one we have recently addressed \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e419\u003c/span\u003e and one we must now apply to this case.\n\nB. Capano's Exercise of His Right to Allocution\n\nCapano elected his right of allocution January 28, 1999, the last day of his penalty phase hearing. On that day, Capano intended to allocute by reading a prepared statement from the witness stand. Before he began, Capano's counsel informed the trial judge that they had instructed Capano about the law of allocution. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e420\u003c/span\u003e Capano's counsel, however, informed the court that Capano had not told them the substance of his allocution. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e421\u003c/span\u003e Before Capano began, the trial judge imposed limitations, without objection, on the substance of allocution. Outside of the jury's presence, the trial judge explained to Capano that his allocution was limited as follows:\n\nAllocution is extended only to acceptable expressions of remorse, pleas for leniency, statements about his own good person and plans or hopes for the future. It is not to dispute the evidence or the verdict, to attack the investigation or the prosecutors. These limits are to be strictly enforced. And if in fact they are violated, I will terminate the allocution. . . .\" \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e422\u003c/span\u003e\n\nNo objection was raised by Capano or his counsel to these limitations. In fact, as noted, these ground rules had already been explained to Capano by his attorneys. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e423\u003c/span\u003e\n\nBefore Capano began to exercise his right of allocution, the trial court related these limitations to the jury, explaining that \"a man who is facing the possibility of capital punishment has the right to address his jurors, his judge, not to dispute the facts of the case or to comment on matters related to the trial, but to deal with those areas that are appropriate for you to consider in determining the questions that lie ahead of you.\" \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e424\u003c/span\u003e\n\nCapano began his allocution by saying, \"I'm not allowed to talk about the evidence, and the next thing I was going to say was about the evidence, so I won't.\" \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e425\u003c/span\u003e Again, at a later point in his testimony, he said with reference to a matter concerning his daughters, \"I'm not allowed to talk about that evidence . . . . \" \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e426\u003c/span\u003e Finally, at the end of allocution, he said, \"There are a couple of other things that I wanted to say but better check and make sure they don't violate any rules. Maybe just one other.\" \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e427\u003c/span\u003e\n\nCapano gave a lengthy allocution covering a number of subjects. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e428\u003c/span\u003e He alluded to his accident defense, saying, for example, that his actions on the night of June 27 were those of a \"panicked man,\" and were a result of \"very cowardly decisions which I think when I was on the stand before I basically already said that much.\" \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e429\u003c/span\u003e\n\nCapano did in fact make some references to the evidence, in spite of the court's limitation. In addition, he discussed his family life, explained his background and personal qualities to the jury, and described his relationship with Fahey, among other things. Thus he had a substantial opportunity to receive the intended benefits of allocution.\n\nCapano raises on this appeal for the first time for plain error review not only the trial judge's limits on discussing the evidence but also the trial court's reaction when Capano entered into a discussion of certain evidence. For example, Capano was discussing his pride in his daughters, and then veered into a discussion of what he viewed as harassment of his daughters, presumably by State officials. He told the jury that \"my kids were harassed. They were lied to and. . . .\" At this point the trial judge interrupted Capano as follows:\n\nThe Court: We're done. Please take Mr. Capano out of the courtroom.\n\nThe Defendant: Can I take it back, Your Honor?\n\nThe Court: No.\n\nThe trial judge immediately relented, however, stating in the presence of the jury:\n\nI will let him continue. Sort of blown my rules apart here and I'll instruct the jury on that, but the next time you make such a blatant attack on the rules that you're forced operate under I will remove you. There won't be taking back anything. You will not be present for the rest of the trial. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e430\u003c/span\u003e\n\nLater, when Capano began discussing his relationship with Fahey, the trial court interrupted, saying:\n\nMr. Capano, if you have any remarks that deal with expressions of remorse, pleas for leniency, plans or hopes for the future, or statements about your own good person, some of which you have already made, please make them now. I will not tolerate any deviance from these conditions. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e431\u003c/span\u003e\n\nWhen Capano left the stand, the trial court delivered the following instruction to the jury:\n\nMembers of the jury, as I indicated before Mr. Capano started his allocution, it's limited to a very narrow framework, specifically the defendant is not permitted to rebut any facts or to deny his guilt or to voice an expression that contradicts the evidentiary facts that you heard in the trial. It is solely for the purpose of acceptable expressions of remorse, pleas for leniency, statements about his own good person, and for his plans and hopes for the future. To the extent that Mr. Capano spoke to those valid areas, you should consider it his testimony. To the extent that he violated the terms of the allocution, which he was specifically informed of prior to taking the stand, you should consider that in any way you deem appropriate. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e432\u003c/span\u003e\n\nThe trial judge did not explain what he meant by the term \"consider that in any way you deem appropriate.\"\n\nThen, in the presence of the jury, the trial judge asked the prosecution \"if the State [has] anything [it] wish[ed] to present in view of the deviation from the purposes of allocution.\" Following a sidebar conference during which the State pressed for an instruction regarding Capano's suggestion that he had been stopped from testifying about certain matters, the Court stated the following to the jury:\n\nThe purpose of the sidebar was for me to reflect on certain statements that were made by Mr. Capano which may have been misleading. Mr. Capano elected the right of allocution, which means that he could take the stand and, within the limitations which I indicated to you, could speak and not be subject to cross examination. There was nothing to permit him or to--excuse me--there was nothing to keep him from taking the stand and testifying on broader issues in the penalty phase; however, had he done that, he would have subjected himself to cross examination. So when he indicated that there were things that he could not talk about, he was right because allocution is very limited, but had a different form been chosen, those limitations would not have been the same. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e433\u003c/span\u003e\n\nC. The Sentencing Decision\n\nThe jury returned its recommendations on January 28, 1999. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e434\u003c/span\u003e Eleven of the 12 jurors found the existence of the statutory aggravating circumstance that \"the murder was premeditated and the result of substantial planning,\" while one juror did not. The jury found that the aggravating circumstances outweighed the mitigating ones, and recommended by a vote of 10 to 2 that the death penalty be imposed. The trial court sentenced Capano to death on March 16, 1999, based on its finding that the State proved beyond a reasonable doubt the statutory aggravating circumstance that Capano had premeditated and substantially planned Fahey's murder. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e435\u003c/span\u003e The trial court also found that the State had proved by substantial and reliable evidence the existence of six non-statutory aggravating circumstances, and that the aggravating circumstances outweighed the five mitigating circumstances that also existed. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e436\u003c/span\u003e\n\nOne of the non-statutory aggravating circumstances found by the trial court was the defendant's \"disdain for authority.\" \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e437\u003c/span\u003e The trial court stated that \"it also is noteworthy that defendant breached many rules the Court imposed during these proceedings. The Court, directly, and through counsel, on numerous occasions set forth rules to defendant which it expected him to follow, and defendant consistently violated those rules. He openly defies authority.\" \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e438\u003c/span\u003e In remarks accompanying the handing down of the sentence, the trial court noted that in spite of the limits of allocution, Capano had \"specifically refused to ask for mercy, showed no remorse, and continued his attack on the decision of the jury [and] the disloyalty of those who testified against him. . . .\" \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e439\u003c/span\u003e\n\nD. Capano's Contentions\n\nCapano argues that his death sentence should be set aside because the trial judge improperly limited the scope of his allocution during the penalty phase of his trial. He argues that he was impermissibly restricted to \"expressions of remorse, pleas for leniency, statements about [his] own good character and person and plans and hopes for the future.\" In addition, Capano contends that the trial judge erred by interrupting him during his allocution and admonishing him in front of the jury for exceeding the scope of the allocution and by commenting to the jury that they could view Capano's exceeding the scope of the allocution \"in any way . . . appropriate.\" Finally, Capano argues that the trial judge erred during sentencing by considering the fact that Capano violated his ruling on the scope of the allocution as a factor in imposing the death sentence.\n\nCapano contends that this Court's standard and scope of review should be de novo. Despite his failure to object, Capano asserts that his resistance to the judge's attempt to limit his right to allocution calls for a less deferential standard of review than plain error. Regardless of the standard, Capano contends that this Court should review his claim because the right to allocution is \"arguably a 'substantial right' of a capital defendant.\" \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e440\u003c/span\u003e The State contends the standard and scope of review is plain error. We agree that plain error is the standard and scope of review.\n\nThe issue we consider is whether the trial judge committed plain error in his limitations on Capano's allocution, in the judge's reactions to Capano's attempts to discuss evidence, made in the jury's presence, and in the judge's direct statements to the jury. The State conceded at oral argument in this Court that the trial judge's limitations on allocution were erroneously restricted and that the court's comments \"probably did\" affect the jury's attitude toward Capano. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e441\u003c/span\u003e Nevertheless, it was proper for the jury to consider any violations of courtroom rules as a non-statutory aggravating factor in its recommendation. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e442\u003c/span\u003e The issue that concerns us here is the likely effect on the jury of the trial judge's reactions to those \"violations.\"\n\nWe are mindful of the trial judge's \"duty to act instantly to control disrespectful or obstructionist tactics in the courtroom.\" \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e443\u003c/span\u003e A trial judge has \"broad latitude\" to take measures to \"preserve order and appropriate conduct in judicial proceedings.\" \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e444\u003c/span\u003e In this case, the trial judge's remarks at sentencing and the sentencing opinion reflect that he found Capano to be a continually disruptive and unruly presence. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e445\u003c/span\u003e\n\nThe trial judge has a unique vantage point, and we do not undertake to second-guess his assessment. We further recognize that the challenge of managing a difficult litigant is magnified in the context of a lengthy capital trial subject to intense public scrutiny. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e446\u003c/span\u003e The trial in this case began on October 6, 1998 and ended on January 17, 1999, a period of nearly three months. The trial judge firmly and ably maintained control over these most difficult proceedings and moved the trial forward expeditiously.\n\nOur task is to assess the likely effect of the trial judge's statements on the fairness and integrity of Capano's penalty phase. Our review of the record convinces us that the totality of the trial judge's handling of the allocution did not unfairly prejudice Capano.\n\nE. The Shelton Jurisprudence\n\nOn June 25, 1999, while Capano's direct appeal to this Court was pending, we released an opinion in Shelton v. State. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e447\u003c/span\u003e In Shelton, the defendant was instructed by the trial judge that he could not use his allocution to \"talk about the facts surrounding the murder.\" \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e448\u003c/span\u003e The trial court instead limited Shelton's allocution to \"asking the sentencing authority . . . to give you mercy, spare your life in this case, and sentence you to life.\" Shelton acquiesced in that limitation because he did not want to discuss the facts in any event. Speaking briefly in allocution, Shelton did not discuss any evidence. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e449\u003c/span\u003e Shelton was sentenced to death for first degree murder and his death sentence was affirmed by this Court on direct appeal. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e450\u003c/span\u003e\n\nIn his motion for post-conviction relief, Shelton argued for the first time that the trial court had infringed his right to present mitigating evidence to the jury in allocution. Shelton argued that this right was guaranteed under Superior Court Criminal Rule 32 as well as the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution. According to Shelton, his counsel had rendered ineffective assistance by failing to object to the limitations placed on his allocution. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e451\u003c/span\u003e\n\nDespite Shelton's clear assent to the limits placed on allocution, we reached the merits of his claim under a plain error standard of review. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e452\u003c/span\u003e We concluded that the limitations placed on Shelton's allocution did not reflect the full scope of allocution under Delaware law. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e453\u003c/span\u003e We defined the scope of allocution as follows:\n\n[T]here is no blanket rule that would preclude a defendant who wished to do so from discussing or arguing in allocution facts already in evidence either in the guilt phase or the penalty phase.\n\nIn our view, Superior Court Criminal Rule 32(a)(1)(C) and 11 Del. C. § 4209(c)(2) provide a defendant in the penalty phase of a capital case the opportunity to argue in allocution from the facts already in evidence in the guilt phase or the penalty phase why those facts should not result in the death penalty. This is true whether the argument is to assert diminished responsibility, reduced culpability in comparison to other defendants, mistaken identity, mistake by the jury in finding guilt or any other reason. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e454\u003c/span\u003e\n\nThus, the Shelton holding allows a defendant to discuss in allocution facts already in evidence, but requires that the defendant be \"sworn and subject to cross-examination\" before making a \"statement of new evidence.\" \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e455\u003c/span\u003e We indicated that this limitation on the presentation of new evidence achieved a balance of the important purposes served by allocution, considerations of fairness toward the defendant as well as the State and the truth-seeking function of the jury. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e456\u003c/span\u003e\n\nIn Shelton, we explained the purposes served by allocution:\n\nPresently, allocution serves two purposes: \"First, it reflects our commonly-held belief that our civilization should afford every defendant an opportunity to ask for mercy. Second, it permits a defendant to impress a jury with his or her feelings of remorse.\" Put another way, allocution is necessary because it affords \"an opportunity for the jury to learn about the 'whole person'\" and \"it bespeaks our common humanity that a defendant not be sentenced to death by a jury 'which has never heard the sound of his voice.'\" \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e457\u003c/span\u003e\n\nThe importance of allowing a defendant to discuss evidence in his allocution must be measured in light of these purposes. In some cases, such as the Shelton case itself, the defendant may have no wish to refer to the facts of the crime for which he was found guilty. In other cases, however, discussing the evidence presented at trial may be a crucial part of the defendant's plea for mercy.\n\nAlthough this evidence may have been before the jury in the guilt phase, the purpose of allocution is for the defendant to be heard under procedures that allow him to speak directly to the jury. In fact, the Delaware death penalty statute expressly permits the defendant as well as his counsel to present \"argument\" and \"summation,\" \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e458\u003c/span\u003e and the Superior Court Rule permits the defendant to present \"any information in mitigation.\" \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e459\u003c/span\u003e In Shelton, we quoted with approval Justice Frankfurter's observation that \"[t]he most persuasive counsel may not be able to speak for a defendant as the defendant might, with halting eloquence, speak for himself.\" \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e460\u003c/span\u003e This policy is a key factor in analyzing the right of allocution and its application to this case.\n\nThe issue in Shelton was first raised in a post-conviction proceeding in that case. The question at that stage of the proceedings was whether Shelton was entitled to a new penalty hearing because of the alleged ineffective assistance of counsel in failing either to object to the overbroad and erroneous limits the trial court had placed on his allocution or to raise the issue on direct appeal. We held that he was not entitled to a new penalty hearing because \"he was unable to show that that he was prejudiced\" by the erroneous limitations. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e461\u003c/span\u003e This was because Shelton's \"considered strategy\" \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e462\u003c/span\u003e was to avoid discussing in allocution the facts of the case. Not only had he made no proffer of what facts he would argue in allocution if allowed, his wish not to discuss the facts surrounding the murder had been made unusually clear through extensive colloquy among the judge, Shelton and counsel. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e463\u003c/span\u003e\n\nShelton's strategy was carried out in his actual allocution, during which Shelton did not discuss the facts or express remorse. Twice he stated in his allocution that he was not pleading for his life. Therefore, the limits placed on allocution and trial counsel's failure to object to those limits became a moot point that resulted in harmless error, and thus were not grounds for overturning the sentence.\n\nF. Plain Error Review in This Case\n\nCapano argues that the limits placed on his allocution were error in light of Shelton. Neither Capano nor his counsel objected to the limits placed on his allocution. Under plain error review, \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e464\u003c/span\u003e the Court will grant relief only if the error complained of is \"so clearly prejudicial to substantial rights as to jeopardize the fairness and integrity of the trial process.\" To establish plain error, Capano has the burden of showing actual prejudice. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e465\u003c/span\u003e\n\nAs noted above, Shelton was not decided until after Capano was sentenced. Nevertheless, the State concedes that the limitations placed on Capano's right of allocution were too restrictive in light of Shelton. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e466\u003c/span\u003e Although it thus concedes error, the State argues that the trial judge's limits on allocution were not plain error in this case. First, the State seems to contend that Shelton should not be applied because it was decided after Capano was sentenced. The rationale of the State's argument is that because the scope of the right of allocution was unclear before Shelton was decided, and was an issue of first impression in Shelton, the error in this case cannot have been \"plain\"--i.e., obvious.\n\nThis argument misconceives the nature of plain error review. Plain errors must be \"apparent on the face of the record.\" \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e467\u003c/span\u003e As suggested by this language, the issue is whether the error is apparent from the vantage point of the appellate court in reviewing the trial record, not whether it was apparent to the trial court in light of then-existing law. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e468\u003c/span\u003e In this case, it is apparent, and conceded by the State, that the limitations imposed on the right of allocution accorded Capano are inconsistent with the right of allocution established in Shelton.\n\nThe trial judge in the case before us was, of course, unaware when he imposed limits on Capano's allocution of what we were later to decide in Shelton. His error, therefore, was understandable. Accordingly, the fact that Shelton was decided after Capano's penalty hearing is not itself a bar to a finding of plain error, but that analysis requires a showing of unfairness and substantial prejudice to Capano.\n\nThe State also contends that there is no plain error because this Court has not definitively declared allocution a \"substantial right.\" Shelton held that on the facts of that case the defendant had not shown that he was prejudiced by the limits placed on his allocution. Shelton was carrying out his own strategy--however misguided that strategy might have been--not to discuss the facts of the case as developed in the guilt phase.\n\nWe held in Shelton that \"it does not follow, however, that a trial judge's setting of parameters on allocution similar to this one [in Shelton's case] would not be reversible error in a proper case where objection to the limitation was preserved, where there was plain error, or where there was a showing of ineffective assistance of counsel and resulting prejudice to the defendant.\" \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e469\u003c/span\u003e We also noted--although determination of the point was not necessary to the decision in Shelton--that the right to allocution \"is arguably a substantial right of a capital defendant.\" \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e470\u003c/span\u003e\n\nWe also held that whether the right of allocution is a substantial right in a given case, it is not a constitutional right under the state or federal constitution. This Court stated in Shelton that the right to allocution \"is not a right granted by either the federal or state constitutions, [but rather] . . . a right that is grounded solely on the Superior Court Criminal Rule, the Delaware death penalty statute and Delaware decisional law.\" \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e471\u003c/span\u003e\n\nIn the context of plain error review, the defendant must show that the error affected substantial rights. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e472\u003c/span\u003e Under the federal plain error rule, the phrase \"affecting substantial rights\" means \"in most cases . . . that the error must have been prejudicial: It must have affected the outcome of the [trial] court proceedings.\" \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e473\u003c/span\u003e To say that a right is not substantial may be merely another way of saying that the defendant cannot have been prejudiced by an erroneous abridgment of that right. We need not engage in an abstract analysis of whether allocution is a \"substantial right.\" Rather, consistent with this Court's plain error jurisprudence, we must decide whether the error that occurred in this case prejudiced Capano when viewed in the total context of the record relating to the allocution issue. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e474\u003c/span\u003e\n\nG. The Issue Whether Capano Was Unduly Prejudiced\n\nCapano argues that his death sentence should be reversed because the trial judge improperly imposed restrictions on his allocution and because he \"paid an enormous price for the trial judge's error\" during the penalty phase. Capano contends that his allocution \"deteriorated into an ongoing battle between [him] and the trial judge.\" The record shows that this is not the case.\n\nThere are at least three important distinctions from Shelton that are relevant to our evaluation of this case in light of the Shelton jurisprudence.\n\n(1) Capano had already told his story to this jury in extensive direct testimony and cross-examination in the guilt phase, whereas Shelton did not testify in his guilt phase. This, in and of itself, is not dispositive, but it is a factor that plays into our plain error review of how far the trial judge must permit the defendant to go in allocution in rehashing and arguing the effect of admitted evidence.\n\n(2) The main purpose of allocution is to permit a defendant to present in his own \"halting eloquence\" his remorse, personal life or diminished culpability (relative to other perpetrators) to a jury that may not have \"heard the sound of his voice.\" \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e475\u003c/span\u003e That policy may have applied to Shelton (but for his express waiver). Capano, on the other hand, was a trained lawyer with trial experience.\n\n(3) Judicial control of the proceedings was clearly at issue here and not in Shelton. Shelton himself was an unsophisticated defendant who was confused but nonetheless clearly and expressly waived his allocution right to argue the facts. Capano, on the other hand, was a trained lawyer. Apparently, the trial judge thought Capano was attempting to manipulate the system and needed to be reined in. Although the trial judge may have been harsh in rebuking him in the presence of the jury, \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e476\u003c/span\u003e we must evaluate the colloquies that took place during the penalty phase in the context of Capano's performance during the entire three-month trial, including his testimony in the guilt phase and his allocution in the penalty phase.\n\nThe State argues that here, as in Shelton, the limitations had no effect on Capano's allocution. According to the State: (a) Capano did manage to discuss some evidence in his lengthy allocution in disregard of the limitations imposed by trial court; and (b) Capano's tactics and comportment during both trial and allocution may well have alienated the jury and foreclosed an argument that he was prejudiced by limits placed on allocution. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e477\u003c/span\u003e The State also argues that the trial court's attempts to control Capano and enforce the limitations on allocution were appropriate efforts to deal with Capano's transgressions and maintain control of the proceedings. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e478\u003c/span\u003e\n\nCapano contends that the trial judge's rebukes of him for violating the erroneous limits on his allocution substantially prejudiced him. Specifically, he argues that the ongoing dispute between Capano and the trial judge risked conveying to the jury that the trial judge felt personal animus toward Capano. In the circumstances, he contends that this atmosphere would likely have affected the jury's deliberations. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e479\u003c/span\u003e This is a capital case that resulted in a death sentence, based in part at least, on the jury's recommendation. Death cases are different from other cases and require heightened sensitivity to the finality of the punishment and scrupulously fair process in the penalty phase. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e480\u003c/span\u003e Notwithstanding these concerns, we find that the trial judge did not commit plain error.\n\nWe focus on four important factors that lead us to conclude, in these circumstances, that the trial court applied a rational, although erroneous, standard when it instructed Capano on the limitations on the scope of his allocution and informed the jury that it had done so.\n\nFirst, Shelton does not mean that there is an almost limitless boundary to the right of allocution. During the penalty phase, to the extent that a defendant seeks to present new matters of relevance that go beyond the record in the guilt phase, thus exceeding the limited parameters permitted in allocution, the defendant must testify under oath and be subjected to cross-examination.\n\nSecond, the trial judge was endeavoring to help the jury focus on \"those areas that are appropriate for you to consider in determining the questions that lie ahead of you.\" \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e481\u003c/span\u003e The questions for determination by the jury at the penalty phase do not include a re-examination of their decision that, beyond a reasonable doubt, Capano had intentionally murdered Anne Marie Fahey.\n\nThird, Capano not only failed to make a proffer, as he should have, regarding the scope of his intended allocution, but also he refused to inform his own counsel--who otherwise may have had the responsibility to do so as officers of the court. His counsel had informed the trial judge that while Capano wished to exercise his right to allocution, \"I have no idea what he is going to say. He won't tell me.\"\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e482\u003c/span\u003e Capano's own maneuvering raised a red flag to the trial judge that trouble loomed ahead.\n\nFourth, Capano did discuss facts that had been admitted in evidence in the guilt phase. We believe that when facts relate to a capital defendant's attempt to display remorse, to minimize the circumstances that relate to aggravation, to diminish degrees of culpability relative to other perpetrators (not applicable here, of course), or to establish a basis for mercy, those facts admitted into evidence at the guilt phase can be drawn upon to support the jury's focus on \"the questions that lie ahead.\"\n\nThe trial judge, in our view, appropriately attempted to establish rational guideposts in light of the anticipated uncertainty. He attempted, as an experienced trial judge managing a difficult case and an unpredictable defendant, to keep the defendant and the jury properly focused on the objective of the penalty phase.\n\nThroughout Capano's allocution, and despite the limitations set by the trial judge, Capano referred to the facts of the case. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e483\u003c/span\u003e In so doing, he consistently deflected responsibility for Fahey's death. He demonstrated disdain for expressing remorse, eschewed a plea for leniency, and spoke little of his good character and person or his plans and hopes for the future. His discussion in his allocution of the facts adduced at the guilt phase was not used to advance the purpose of allocution at all.\n\nCapano is not a typical defendant, nor is he an unsophisticated defendant. He is a sophisticated lawyer, trained and experienced in the law and the public domain. He consciously avoided making a proffer of his remarks, refused to tell his counsel of his plans, heard and accepted the trial judge's rulings without objection and then intentionally and purposefully violated the parameters of the rulings he accepted.\n\nIn his sentencing decision, the trial judge found that \"[t]he evidence showed defendant is manipulative, controlling, vindictive. His need for control over those around him is overwhelming.\" \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e484\u003c/span\u003e The trial judge added: \"It is also noteworthy that defendant breached many rules the Court imposed during these proceedings. The Court, directly, and through counsel, on numerous occasions set forth rules to defendant which it expected him to follow, and defendant consistently violated those rules. He openly defies authority.\" \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e485\u003c/span\u003e\n\nCapano claims that his allocution became an \"unmitigated disaster\" because the trial judge maintained control over him. The trial judge showed understandable frustration with Capano's antics, and may have been harsh in his rebukes, but he also showed patience and restraint with Capano. Indeed, Capano's counsel admitted that the trial judge showed restraint despite Capano's repeated violations of the court's ruling on the scope of the allocution. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e486\u003c/span\u003e\n\nCapano also argues that the trial judge improperly considered Capano's allocution when imposing the sentence of death. During the sentencing hearing, the trial judge summarized Capano's behavior and attitude during the entire trial. While lengthy, the quote below is important to understand the context in which the statements that Capano complains about were made:\n\nIn the end, the defendant claimed the right of allocution, the ancient avenue of a convicted criminal facing death to accept responsibility, express remorse, and ask for mercy, relying upon his good and contrite character to gain that mercy.\n\nAs a lawyer, specifically instructed by his own lawyers on the limits of allocution, and further admonished by the Court before and during allocution, he specifically refused to ask for mercy, showed no remorse, and continued his attack on the decision of the jury, the disloyalty of those who testified against him, and the tactics of the investigators who assembled and presented the case against him, all specific violations of the right of allocution.\n\nThe selfishness, arrogance and manipulativeness of Thomas Capano destroyed his own family as well as the Fahey family. He did not hesitate to use his family to commit or suborn perjury or to ask for the mercy he specifically refused to ask for himself. His only remorse is for himself.\n\nThe most powerful mitigation presented does not involve the defendant. Rather, it is the impact on his remarkable daughters and a brother he involved in his criminal activities and then ridiculed and excommunicated from the family when guilt and circumstances forced him to tell the truth.\n\nTom Capano does not face judgment today because his friends and family failed him. He faces judgment because he is a ruthless murderer who feels compassion for no one, and remorse only for the circumstances he finds himself in.\n\nHe is a malignant force from whom no one he deems disloyal or adversarial can be secure, even if he is incarcerated for the rest of his life.\n\nThe trial judge did not emasculate Capano's right to allocution by considering his behavior or attitude during allocution. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e487\u003c/span\u003e Capano failed to adhere to the purpose of allocution. Although the limitations in the instructions were erroneous and although the trial judge may have been harsh in his reactions to Capano's antics, it was Capano alone who destroyed his opportunity to present evidence in mitigation. Instead, he used the opportunity to vilify others and transfer responsibility for Fahey's death.\n\nThe error of the trial judge in limiting Capano's right to discuss proper facts is harmless. In fact, it is a moot point for two reasons: First, Capano did not want to discuss proper facts; he wanted to assail people and institutions. This is not an acceptable use of the right of allocution. Second, he did in fact discuss a number of matters despite the trial court's limitations, and he was thus able to put before the jury much of what he wanted them to hear--although it is doubtful that he helped his own case. If there was any prejudice to Capano in the allocution episode, it was primarily self-inflicted.\n\nAccordingly, we hold that as a matter of Delaware's law of allocution, any erroneous limitations placed on Capano's right of allocution and the trial judge's colloquy with Capano in front of the jury, although regrettable, did not prejudice Capano and do not entitle him to a new penalty hearing.\n\nXVI. Constitutionality of Delaware's Death Penalty Statute\n\nCapano raises two challenges to the constitutionality of Delaware's statutory death penalty process. He first contends that the process violates his right to a jury trial because a trial judge may apply the death penalty under 11 Del. C. § 4209 where, as in this case, the jury did not unanimously find a statutory aggravating factor. Capano also argues that Delaware's sentencing procedure violates the Fourteenth Amendment Due Process Clause because it permits the trial judge to find a statutory aggravating factor without being bound by a jury verdict on the underlying issues of fact. This Court reviews de novo claims alleging that the trial court's decision to sentence Capano to death violated Capano's constitutional rights. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e488\u003c/span\u003e\n\nA. Right to a Jury Trial as Applied to the Penalty Hearing under the Delaware Death Penalty Statute\n\nWe note at the outset that the Delaware death penalty statute, like those of several other states, expressly contemplates non-unanimous and non-binding jury recommendations. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e489\u003c/span\u003e We must therefore determine whether a defendant's right to a jury trial under Article I, Section 4 of the Delaware Constitution necessarily implies a right to a unanimous jury verdict on all facts. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e490\u003c/span\u003e\n\nThe Delaware Constitution guarantees that \"[t]rial by jury shall be as heretofore.\" \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e491\u003c/span\u003e This phrase incorporates by reference the common law right to trial by jury, and \"any analysis of the right to a trial by jury, as it is guaranteed by the Delaware Constitution, requires an examination of the common law.\" \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e492\u003c/span\u003e Based on a common law analysis, this Court has previously found that under the Delaware Constitution, \"[u]nanimity of the jurors is . . . required to reach a verdict.\" \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e493\u003c/span\u003e This jurisprudence relates to the determination of guilt. Undertaking a similar inquiry in State v. Cohen, \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e494\u003c/span\u003e however, we held that the right to trial by jury under the Delaware Constitution does not guarantee \"the right . . . to have a jury determine punishment in a capital case.\" \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e495\u003c/span\u003e Instead, the Cohen Court found that \"the jury's historic role was limited to that of a trier of facts, determining guilt or innocence.\" \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e496\u003c/span\u003e\n\nWe therefore conclude that the jury is not required to return a unanimous finding of an aggravating factor in its advisory role during the penalty phase. Although a jury's advisory report on statutory aggravating circumstances necessarily requires the jury to resolve factual disputes, this exercise is fundamentally different from a jury's fact-finding role in the guilt phase under the common law. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e497\u003c/span\u003e\n\nFirst, as noted earlier, a jury at common law was charged with finding facts only in connection with a determination of guilt or innocence. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e498\u003c/span\u003e Here, the jury unanimously determined Capano's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. By contrast, under Delaware's death penalty statute, a jury makes only recommendations relevant to punishment. Second, a jury's verdict at common law is binding--rather than advisory--as long as its conclusions are rational. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e499\u003c/span\u003e Under the Delaware death penalty statute, however, a jury in the penalty phase \"functions only in an advisory capacity\" and as the \"conscience of the community.\" \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e500\u003c/span\u003e Put differently, Section 4209 assigns to the trial judge \"the ultimate responsibility for determining whether the defendant will be sentenced to life imprisonment or death.\" \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e501\u003c/span\u003e\n\nBased on these considerations, we conclude that a jury's advisory report under the Delaware death penalty statute does not fit within the jury's common law role as fact-finder. As a result, the jury's recommendations under Section 4209 are not subject to the unanimity requirement, and Capano is therefore not entitled to a unanimous jury finding as to the existence of a statutory aggravating factor before the trial judge imposes a death sentence.\n\nB. Application to the Death Penalty Statute of the United States Supreme Court's Decision in Apprendi\n\nCapano's second constitutional challenge to Delaware's death penalty procedure is based on the United States Supreme Court's recent decision in Apprendi v. New Jersey. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e502\u003c/span\u003e Under Capano's reading of Apprendi, the Delaware statute violates the Due Process Clause because it permits the trial judge to find a statutory aggravating factor without being bound by a jury verdict on the underlying issues of fact. Capano's argument thus concludes that, in the language of the Apprendi decision, the Delaware statute \"remove[s] from the jury the assessment of facts that increase the prescribed range of penalties to which the defendant is exposed.\" \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e503\u003c/span\u003e\n\nBut here, the penalty phase did not \"increase\" Capano's \"exposure\" to the \"prescribed range of penalties.\" His exposure to the death penalty had already been determined when the jury unanimously returned the verdict of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt of first degree murder.\n\nThe New Jersey statute at issue in Apprendi was not a death penalty statute, and the holding in Apprendi does not bear on any issue involved in this case. The statute there was designed to provide punishment beyond the statutory maximum for the underlying crime where the criminal conduct was motivated by animus against minority groups. After a jury finds a defendant guilty of a statutory crime, the New Jersey statute provides for a separate proceeding in which the trial judge alone is authorized to impose an additional sentence beyond the statutory maximum. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e504\u003c/span\u003e\n\nUnder the New Jersey statute struck down in Apprendi, the judge may impose the additional sentence if the judge finds by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant's motivation in committing the underlying crime was to intimidate the victim based on the victim's race, gender, or religion. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e505\u003c/span\u003e The Supreme Court invalidated the New Jersey statute on the ground that the statute constituted an additional element of the underlying crime--i.e., the defendant's motivation--that must be submitted to a jury and proven beyond a reasonable doubt before the maximum authorized penalty may be increased. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e506\u003c/span\u003e\n\nIn our view, Apprendi neither explicitly nor implicitly invalidates the Delaware death penalty statute. First and most important, the Apprendi Court explicitly preserved the line of cases upholding death penalty procedures similar to Section 4209:\n\n[T]his Court has previously considered and rejected the argument that the principles guiding our decision today render invalid state capital sentencing schemes requiring judges, after a jury verdict holding a defendant guilty of a capital crime, to find specific aggravating factors before imposing a sentence of death. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e507\u003c/span\u003e\n\nThe dissent in Apprendi characterizes this analysis as too formalistic because \"the Arizona first-degree murder statute [in Walton v. Arizona] authorizes a maximum penalty of death only in a formal sense.\" \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e508\u003c/span\u003e In reality, the dissent argues, \"the Arizona sentencing scheme removes from the jury the assessment of a fact that determines whether the defendant can receive that maximum punishment.\" \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e509\u003c/span\u003e Although this analysis may present a valid criticism of the majority's reasoning, the fact remains that a majority of the Court concluded that the holding in Apprendi did not disturb the line of decisions approving of death penalty statutes like that in Delaware.\n\nEven if the Supreme Court had not explicitly preserved the death penalty cases, the language in Apprendi makes it clear that the Court did not intend to disturb the holdings in these cases. Notwithstanding the dissent's concern over their perception of the breadth of the majority's reasoning, the holding in Apprendi is narrow: \"Other than the fact of a prior conviction, any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\" \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e510\u003c/span\u003e Moreover, the Court previously held that \"the finding of aggravating facts fall[s] within the traditional scope of capital sentencing as a choice between a greater and a lesser penalty, not as a process of raising the ceiling of the sentencing range available.\" \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e511\u003c/span\u003e\n\nUnder Delaware's death penalty procedure, when a jury finds a defendant guilty of first degree murder, the jury authorizes the statutory maximum penalty: the death sentence, subject to the penalty phase and the judge's decision on sentencing. Once the jury during the guilt phase of the trial authorizes the maximum penalty, \"'it may be left to the judge to decide whether that maximum penalty, rather than a lesser one, ought to be imposed. . . .'\" \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e512\u003c/span\u003e We therefore conclude that the holding in Apprendi does not implicitly or explicitly affect the Supreme Court's previous decisions permitting judges to find statutory aggravating factors without a jury verdict on the underlying factual questions.\n\nThe New Jersey statute that was struck down in Apprendi is also distinguishable from Delaware's death penalty statute. The aggravating factors described in Delaware's Section 4209 do not constitute additional elements needed to establish guilt of a \"capital murder\" offense that a jury must unanimously find beyond a reasonable doubt. These aggravating factors relate only to the penalty phase where the jury acts as an advisory body to the sentencing judge. The Apprendi Court distinguished an \"element\" of a crime from a \"sentencing factor\" according to whether \"the required finding expose[s] the defendant to a greater punishment than that authorized by the jury's guilty verdict.\" \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e513\u003c/span\u003e As we noted earlier, a conviction at the guilt phase by a unanimous jury under the first degree murder statute constitutes the authorization for the later imposition of the death penalty. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e514\u003c/span\u003e Because the finding of an aggravating factor does not \"expose the defendant to a greater punishment than that authorized\" by a first degree murder conviction, the aggravating factor is not an additional element of the first degree murder offense. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e515\u003c/span\u003e In addition, the Delaware statute requires that the trial judge find aggravating circumstances beyond a reasonable doubt. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e516\u003c/span\u003e The New Jersey hate crime statute, by contrast, required a finding by a preponderance of the evidence that the underlying crime was motivated by a desire to intimidate. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e517\u003c/span\u003e\n\nAccordingly, we conclude that the death penalty process in 11 Del. C. § 4209 does not violate the right to a trial by jury under the Delaware Constitution and does not violate the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\nXVII. Aggravating Circumstance Instruction\n\nCapano argues that the aggravating circumstance instruction given to the jury in connection with its sentencing recommendation was erroneous. According to Capano, this instruction defined the relevant aggravating circumstance in such a way as to allow the jury to recommend the death penalty if it found the same degree of intent required to convict of first degree murder.\n\nReview of this claim is de novo. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e518\u003c/span\u003e We do not agree with Capano's argument because we find that the instruction in this case sufficiently narrowed the class of people eligible for the death sentence.\n\nThe statutory aggravating circumstance in question is that \"the murder was premeditated and the result of substantial planning.\" \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e519\u003c/span\u003e In making a sentencing recommendation, the jury was required to answer two questions. First, whether this aggravating circumstance existed. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e520\u003c/span\u003e Second, whether the aggravating circumstances it found (statutory or non-statutory) outweighed any mitigating circumstances it found. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e521\u003c/span\u003e In this case, the jury found by a vote of 11 to 1 that the statutory aggravating circumstance existed. The jury also found by a vote of 10 to 2 that the aggravating circumstances in the case outweighed the mitigating circumstances also present. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e522\u003c/span\u003e\n\nThe aggravating circumstance instruction delivered by the trial judge to the jury in this case is as follows:\n\nThis statutory aggravating circumstance requires a finding of premeditation. In order for a murder to be premeditated, the defendant must have thought about it, considered it, or deliberated about it beforehand. The design to kill must arise from the sedate, deliberative process and not a rash or impulsive, though intentional act. This statutory aggravating circumstance also requires that the murder was the result of substantial planning. Substantial planning is planning which is considerable or ample for the commission of the crime. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e523\u003c/span\u003e\n\nWe find no merit in Capano's argument that this instruction fails to distinguish for the jury between the aggravating circumstance of \"premeditation\" and \"substantial planning\" and the \"intent\" element of first degree murder.\n\nDue process requires aggravating circumstances to \"genuinely narrow the class of persons eligible for the death penalty and . . . reasonably justify the imposition of a more severe sentence on the defendant compared to others found guilty of murder.\" \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e524\u003c/span\u003e The aggravating circumstances must \"permit the sentencer to make a principled distinction between those who deserve the death penalty and those who do not.\" \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e525\u003c/span\u003e In determining whether these criteria are met, \"we find the relevant inquiry to be whether 'the sentencer fairly could conclude that an aggravating circumstance [in this case, as defined in the jury instructions] applies to every defendant eligible for the death sentence. . . .'\" \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e526\u003c/span\u003e\n\nThe instruction in this case fulfilled these criteria. The instruction defines the aggravating circumstance in a way that excludes intentional killings that are not a result of calm deliberation and preparation. The instruction requires that the planning be substantial, i.e., \"considerable or ample,\" not merely the amount of planning necessary for the act resulting in death. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e527\u003c/span\u003e Moreover, the instruction specifically excludes killings that are \"rash or impulsive, though intentional.\" In contrast, a first degree murder conviction requires only that the killing be intentional. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e528\u003c/span\u003e Therefore, Capano's argument is without merit.\n\nXVIII. Statutorily Mandated Review of Capano's Death Sentence\n\nThis Court must conduct a mandatory, limited review of the Superior Court's imposition of the death sentence. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e529\u003c/span\u003e Under 11 Del. C. § 4209(g)(2)b, we must examine the evidence in the record to determine whether it supports the Superior Court's finding of a statutory aggravating circumstance. We must then address both determinations required by subparagraph a. of Section 4209(g)(2). \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e530\u003c/span\u003e Under this analysis, we first consider whether the imposition of the death penalty was arbitrary or capricious. Second, we consider whether the death penalty in the present case was disproportionate to that imposed in similar cases. When undertaking these inquiries, we must consider as a whole the aggravating and mitigating evidence as it bears upon the circumstances of the crime and the character of the defendant. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e531\u003c/span\u003e\n\nA. Statutory Aggravating Circumstance\n\nCapano does not argue that the evidence was insufficient to support the Superior Court's finding of a statutory aggravating circumstance. The jury found by a vote of 11 to 1 that \"the murder was premeditated and the result of substantial planning.\" \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e532\u003c/span\u003e The trial court found that the State had proven this statutory aggravating factor beyond a reasonable doubt. There was substantial evidence, which has been discussed at length in sections of this Opinion, to support this finding.\n\nB. Death Penalty Not Arbitrary or Capricious\n\nThis Court must review the death sentence to consider whether the imposition of the death sentence was arbitrary or capricious. Capano does not argue that it was. Nonetheless, we find that the record \"reflects that the Superior Court's decision to impose the death penalty was 'the product of a deliberate, rational and logical deductive process.'\" \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e533\u003c/span\u003e The court recognized that, in determining the punishment, the weighing of aggravating and mitigating circumstances is qualitative not quantitative and must take into account the totality of the circumstances present. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e534\u003c/span\u003e\n\nIn addition to the statutory aggravating circumstance, the trial court found that the State had proved by substantial and reliable evidence the existence of the following non-statutory aggravating circumstances: \"1) Substantial impact of the murder upon friends, family and co-workers of Fahey; 2) Past actions of defendant seeking to harm an ex-lover; \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e535\u003c/span\u003e 3) Defendant's vindictiveness; 4) Defendant's criminal conspiracies; \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e536\u003c/span\u003e 5) Defendant's continuing manipulative behavior; 6) Defendant's lack of remorse; 7) Defendant's disdain for authority; and 8) Defendant remains a threat to direct crimes of vengeance while incarcerated.\" \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e537\u003c/span\u003e\n\nThe trial court also found the existence of six mitigating factors: \"1) Defendant's lack of any prior criminal record; 2) The need for his daughters to have him in their lives; 3) The need for his mother to have him in her life; 4) The need of other family members to have him in their lives; 5) The intense guilt which Louis and, particularly, Gerard would feel for their part in participating in these proceedings which might result in defendant's death; and 6) Defendant's community service.\" \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e538\u003c/span\u003e\n\nThe Superior Court carefully weighed the aggravating and mitigating circumstances in this case, articulating the grounds for its decision to impose the death penalty. The court concluded (in part) as follows:\n\nDefendant planned, over a period of time, to kill Anne Marie Fahey and to dispose of her body so that it could not be found. He then blamed the murder on an ex-lover who had testified against him. The crime defendant committed was horrific. The crime epitomized the makeup of his character: vindictive and controlling.\n\nThe circumstances of the murder here are similar to those in Gattis. No one, except the defendant, ever will know exactly how or why Anne Marie Fahey died. What is certain is that it was not a crime of passion but, rather, a crime of control. By all accounts, she had ceased to be defendant's lover but had never escaped his sphere of influence, control and manipulation. Defendant's premeditation and planning was for a contingency that, perhaps, he hoped would never happen, but did, on the evening of June 27, 1996. He chose to destroy a possession rather than lose it; to execute an escaping chattel.\n\nThe only mitigating circumstances of significance to this Court concern defendant's daughters and the impact of the crime on Gerard. Defendant's daughters' love for their father is deep and genuine and they want him in their lives. However, during this trial, defendant has shown that he will take advantage of his daughters to accomplish an end which benefits himself. Their love for him is great. However, since defendant's past history is a prime indicator of his future behavior, it is clear that defendant poses a threat of harm to his daughters' well-being.\n\nGerard does not want defendant sentenced to death; he will feel great responsibility for it. Gerard bears no blame; instead, the blame goes directly to defendant. Defendant involved Gerard in his murder plans.\n\nDefendant committed the murder. Defendant is the one who must accept all blame, but does not because of his flawed character. Gerard should understand that defendant is reacting in his normal way: to strike out at the disloyal subject and punish that person who attempts to do what is right and not immoral.\n\nAbsent the harm to his daughters and to Gerard, there is nothing in defendant's life which would call for the imposition of a life sentence. Defendant will not adjust well in prison; he will constantly scheme to by-pass prison rules; he will defy prison authority; he will continue to manipulate those who love him from within the prison walls. He poses a threat of harm even while incarcerated. He committed a horrific crime. That crime and his antisocial behavior outweigh any mitigating circumstances. The sentence of death is warranted in this case. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e539\u003c/span\u003e\n\nBased on the record and the deliberate, rational, logical deductive process reflected in the trial court's opinion, we conclude that the trial court did not impose the death sentence either arbitrarily or capriciously under 11 Del. C. § 4209(g)(2)a.\n\nC. Death Penalty Proportionality Review\n\nIn conducting the statutorily-mandated proportionality inquiry, the Court \"refers to the 'universe' of cases involving first degree murder charges that have included a penalty hearing and after the conclusion of which the sentence has become final.\" \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e540\u003c/span\u003e Those cases appear as an appendix to this decision. An exact comparison of these cases is not practicable, \"but a review of some objective factors, including the gravity of the offense, the circumstances surrounding the crime, and the harshness of the penalty is helpful in reaching a determination of whether or not this case fits within a pattern of Delaware death sentence precedent.\" \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e541\u003c/span\u003e\n\nCapano argues that his death sentence is disproportionate. According to Capano, the universe of cases in which the death penalty has been imposed involves cases with \"multiple victims\" \"and/or multiple statutory aggravating factors.\" \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e542\u003c/span\u003e Capano argues that his case is \"significantly less aggravated,\" and that \"in single-victim cases, arising from a fractured personal relationship, death sentences are not routinely imposed.\"\n\nCapano's argument is not persuasive. First, the fact that Fahey was Capano's only victim in this case does not meaningfully distinguish other cases meriting the death penalty. Nor does the fact that this killing involved a \"fractured relationship.\" Like others sentenced to death in Delaware, Capano was found guilty of an unprovoked, cold-blooded murder of a defenseless person. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e543\u003c/span\u003e Moreover, we have stated that the \"deliberate, cold-blooded killing, in execution style, of a helpless spouse or lover, is deserving of society's harshest condemnation.\" \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e544\u003c/span\u003e The evidence in this case was that Capano spent months planning to kill Fahey, his one-time lover.\n\nCapano relies on Taylor v. State, \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e545\u003c/span\u003e and Williamson v. State, \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e546\u003c/span\u003e cases involving brutal murders in which the defendant was not sentenced to death. In Taylor, the defendant stabbed his pregnant girlfriend after breaking into her apartment. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e547\u003c/span\u003e In Williamson, the defendant surprised and strangled his victim in front of a woman whom he had bound and raped. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e548\u003c/span\u003e In Taylor and Williamson the qualitative nature of the mitigation evidence was different from that involved in this case. Although Taylor and Williamson could have justified a sentence of death, their cases nevertheless are distinguishable on a fundamental level because there is no suggestion in those cases of substantial planning and premeditation as was found in this case. Cases imposing the death penalty have given weight to the existence of a plan to carry out the murder. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e549\u003c/span\u003e\n\nSecond, the fact that there is only one statutory aggravating factor in this case does not make imposition of the death penalty disproportionate. The number of statutory aggravating factors does not indicate fully the gravity of the offense and the totality of the circumstances surrounding the crime. As the trial court recognized, Capano's planned murder of Fahey was \"horrific.\"\n\nIn Zebroski, we found that the death penalty was not disproportionate where only one statutory aggravating factor was found but in which there were a number of non-statutory aggravating circumstances. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e550\u003c/span\u003e Similarly, in this case, there were substantial non-statutory aggravating circumstances. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e551\u003c/span\u003e The trial court discussed several instances of reprehensible behavior by Capano. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e552\u003c/span\u003e During his incarceration before trial, Capano conspired with another inmate to have MacIntyre's house burglarized in order to intimidate her into not testifying truthfully. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e553\u003c/span\u003e Perhaps most egregiously, Capano kept his knowledge of Fahey's fate hidden from her family for over two years in order to escape detection. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e554\u003c/span\u003e Accordingly, we hold that the imposition by the Superior Court judge of a death sentence in this case was not disproportionate to sentences imposed on other defendants in the relevant universe of cases. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e555\u003c/span\u003e\n\nXIX. Conclusion\n\nFor the reasons set forth herein, the judgment of the Superior Court is affirmed. The matter is remanded to the Superior Court for the purpose of setting a new execution date.\n\nSTEELE, Justice, with whom CHANDLER, Chancellor, joins concurring:\n\nI join in and agree with the majority's judgment to affirm. I believe that the majority opinion carefully and persuasively determines that the trial judge's immediate response to Gerry's comment about the impending lie detector test by striking the reference and by issuing a clear cautionary instruction to the jury cured any potential prejudice to Capano. Further, I agree that the majority opinion thoughtfully makes the case that when the trial judge admitted Lyons' testimony about the circumstances that induced Gerry's alleged further disclosure that any error by so doing was harmless. I, therefore, concur with the majority's ultimate conclusion that neither ruling \"warrant[s] a reversal of Capano's conviction and sentence.\"\n\nI respectfully would hold, notwithstanding any concurrence in the result, and contrary to Part III B of the majority Opinion, that the trial judge properly admitted Lyons' testimony. In my view, therefore, the trial judge committed no error whatsoever.\n\nI agree with the majority's conclusions that:\n\n1. the trial judge's limiting instructions minimized the impact of Lyons' testimony about the timing of Gerry's full disclosure of the alleged facts and of Gerry's revelation that he believed that he would have to be more forthcoming before he \"went and took the lie detector test\" that, inferentially, might be required by the FBI; and,\n\n2. given the totality of the evidence of planning, that portion of it supplied by Gerry as part of his fuller disclosure \"was not an indispensable or critical part of the State's case.\"\n\nHowever, two important considerations lead me to the conclusion that the trial judge correctly allowed Lyons' testimony explaining the circumstances surrounding Gerry's fuller disclosure.\n\nFirst, trial judges regularly meet the needs of parties to explain (and juries to understand) salient facts in a case where there are legitimate risks of a misunderstanding of the relevance of that evidence, or where the danger exists that, though relevant, the evidence might create unfair prejudice. Evidence is often admitted for a limited purpose, with proper cautionary instructions, and legitimately so. Evidence has only one ultimate purpose - \"that the truth may be ascertained and proceedings justly determined.\" \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e556\u003c/span\u003e When a trial judge \"restricts the evidence to its proper scope and instruct[s] the jury accordingly,\" \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e557\u003c/span\u003e he or she does so with ascertainment of the truth uppermost in mind.\n\nSecond, regardless of the prosecutor's recasting of Lyons' testimony in his closing, Lyons never attempted to comment on the truthfulness of Gerry's disclosure before or after Gerry's decision to disclose more fully what he \"knew\" to federal agents. Lyons, though his attorney, was in no position to support Gerry's credibility at either point in time. I have no reservation in concluding that the jury clearly understood that very point.\n\nI fully endorse the majority's view, explained in Section II of the Opinion, on the Delaware Courts' approach to the admissibility or exclusion of evidence. Entirely consistent with that view, is my belief that it is better to let the jury know the actual, truthful explanation of why at that particular moment Gerry expanded his testimony, with appropriate caution, than to leave them to speculate on a wide range of irrelevant, untruthful possibilities for his apparent epiphany.\n\nThe Reference to a Polygraph Test\n\nI agree that any reference to a polygraph test may be potentially mischievous and should, therefore, be brought to the trial judge's attention and carefully screened with enhanced scrutiny to assure that no other appropriate alternative evidence is available to establish the relevant operative fact sought to be admitted and that a restrictive instruction be crafted to instruct the jury on the limited purpose for which the evidence is being admitted. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e558\u003c/span\u003e I further agree that Whalen may not be read broadly to permit references to a lie detector test to prove a limitless range of operative facts. Nevertheless, a \"per se exclusionary rule\" would go too far when there may be no other basis for admitting critical evidence, the trial judge conducts an appropriate Rule 403 analysis and then formulates a clear cautionary instruction for the jury.\n\nHere, I see little meaningful difference between admitting polygraph evidence to prove that under all of the circumstances a confession was voluntary (as in Whalen) and admitting evidence that a witness believed he would have to submit to a polygraph - a belief which caused him to divulge more expansively his knowledge of facts relating to issues in this case. In light of the trial judge's cautionary instruction, I believe there is no basis to conclude that either (1) the jury would simply blatantly ignore the instruction and blindly find that Gerry both took the test and passed it, or (2) the jury proceeded, contrary to the instruction, to find through speculation about unreliable evidence that Gerry ultimately told the truth.\n\nLyons' Testimony and Attorney Vouching\n\nWhile I agree that if it was error to admit the Lyons testimony that it was harmless error, and therefore concur in the conclusion to affirm on this point, I respectfully depart from the majority's view that the references were dubious or problematic under the circumstances of this case and would rule that the references were properly admitted.\n\nLyons' actual testimony mentions only that he told Gerry that \"yes,\" he would or might be required to take a polygraph test and that \"you can't hold anything back.\" The purpose of this testimony was to explain the circumstances surrounding Gerry's fuller disclosure of what he, Gerry, believed to have occurred. At no time did Lyons attempt to characterize the testimony in any way to bolster Gerry's credibility. I recognize the points made by the majority in support of their view that there was \"potential that Lyons' status as an experienced lawyer may have imparted credibility to Gerry's testimony . . . .\" I note and accept as reasonable the majority's view that \". . . a jury would be likely to infer that Gerry did not disregard Lyons' emphatic directive to make full disclosure.\" (emphases added) I simply do not agree with those inferences in light of the cautionary instruction given to the jury and my own, I hope equally reasonable inference, that a jury does not, in our current culture, accept criminal defense attorneys as the paradigm for \"truth, justice and the American way\" (if there still be one). Explaining why Gerry offered additional detail at that point would assist the jury's understanding of relevant events. The trial judge immediately instructed the jury, appropriately limiting the inferences that they could fairly draw from the references to a prospective polygraph test or from Lyons' status as an attorney. Nothing in Lyons' actual testimony suggested that suddenly Gerry then started telling the truth and that he may not have been until that denouement. The jury had to understand from the cautionary instruction that they still had to resolve whether Gerry told the truth before and after he concluded that he would more fully disclose what he knew. The jury knew that they remained free to conclude that this turncoat brother lied both before and after the fuller disclosure because the cautionary instruction told them as much. If error occurred, no matter how harmless, it occurred when the prosecutor, without objection, embellished the inference in his closing by asserting that Lyons said \"you have to tell the complete truth,\" when in fact, Lyons made no such statement. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e559\u003c/span\u003e\n\nI, therefore, would conclude that the trial judge did not abuse his discretion when he allowed Lyons to testify and when he permitted the State to elicit testimony that Gerry had disclosed additional information when confronted with the probability that he would face a polygraph test when the trial judge's instruction appropriately limited the jury's consideration of the circumstances under which it was admitted and the purpose for which it was admitted.\n\nCHANDLER, Chancellor, with whom STEELE, Justice, joins concurring:\n\nI join in and agree with the ultimate judgment to affirm in Chief Justice Veasey's Opinion for the Court. Nevertheless, I respectfully disagree with the analysis by the majority in two areas of the Opinion--Part III.B. and Part XV.\n\nFor reasons I briefly set forth below (as well as those raised in Justice Steele's concurrence, with which I fully agree and in which I also join), I do not agree with the majority's determination that the trial court erred when it (1) admitted Lyons' testimony about the lie detector test, and (2) limited the scope of Capano's allocution.\n\n1. Lyons' Lie Detector Testimony\n\nAs do most jurisdictions, Delaware has a long-standing, and quite proper, prohibition against admission of the results of lie detector tests. Such a prohibition is warranted because the results of a lie detector examination are inherently unreliable, and their apparent scientific nature has the potential to mislead jurors into giving the results undue weight. Admission of results of lie detector tests, therefore, may constitute reversible error. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e560\u003c/span\u003e\n\nThe testimony in this case concerning a potential lie detector test, however, is quite different. Here, there was no evidence presented to the jury that a lie detector test was ever administered to Gerry Capano, let alone what the results of such a test might have been. Rather, the testimony in this case indicated that Gerry believed that he was subject to a lie detector test. This was offered to explain to the jury why Gerry changed his statement to investigators in the case. As the trial judge properly instructed the jury, in his limiting instruction, this evidence was provided to them so that they could perform their most basic function: evaluation of the reliability of evidence from which they could draw conclusions of fact. Given the trial judge's adequate and explicit limiting instruction, and given the nature of the evidence presented, this is not a case in which the unduly persuasive value of the results of a pseudo-scientific lie detector test tainted the jury's deliberations. Because the majority appears to impose unnecessarily restrictive standards on the admission of relevant testimony that happens to include the words \"lie detector,\" I cannot join in the majority's finding of error. I do join in the majority's ultimate conclusion that any error (had there been one) was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\nLikewise, I respectfully disagree with the majority's conclusion that the trial court erred in admitting Lyons' testimony because it amounted to a \"subtle and indirect version of vouching for Gerry's credibility.\" \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e561\u003c/span\u003e Relying upon Graves v. State, \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e562\u003c/span\u003e the majority views Lyons' admonitions to Gerry \"to make full disclosure\" and Gerry's possible exposure to a lie detector test, together with Lyons' status as an experienced lawyer and former federal prosecutor, as the subtle equivalent of Lyons' vouching for Gerry's truthfulness in his disclosures to federal prosecutors. I confess that the majority's rationale is too subtle for me to grasp.\n\nFirst, Lyons never testified explicitly, or implicitly, that he thought Gerry was being truthful, either before or after Gerry changed his story with the prosecutors. Second, none of the \"reputational boasting\" that occurred in Graves occurred here. Third, I think the majority has confused two distinct concepts. It is unproblematic for a jury to be provided information that may assist them in assessing the credibility of a witness. That is what occurred here. Lyons explained how he urged Gerry to \"not hold anything back.\" The jury was entitled to consider that fact in its effort to assess whether Gerry was, at trial, telling the whole truth and whether the story he told to federal agents was the whole truth. What the majority then finds troubling is that Lyons' testimony might have been persuasive, that is, that the jury could have found that his advice had actually caused Gerry to have spoken truthfully to federal agents. But that conclusion is also unproblematic. The jury quite properly could consider whether a witness's testimony had changed because that witness had been advised to not hold anything back. Similarly, the jury quite properly could consider testimony that a witness's story had changed because the witness had been warned that he faced perjury charges if he did not testify fully about what had happened. I find nothing problematic about a jury having the right to consider and assess whether information of this kind is helpful in determining whether a particular witness is credible or not.\n\nThe majority finds it \"implicit in Lyons' testimony that Lyons believed his own admonitions to have been effective . . . [and] [t]hus a subtle and indirect version of vouching for Gerry's credibility.\" \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e563\u003c/span\u003e If I found such vouching were \"implicit\" (or explicit) in Lyons' testimony, I also would be concerned. The danger then would be that the jury would evaluate Gerry's credibility not on the facts (including, permissibly, the fact of Lyons' admonitions) but rather based on Lyons' presumably expert opinion (that he, Lyons, believed Gerry had followed his advice), thus impermissibly abdicating the jury's role as fact finder. The problem, in my view, with the majority opinion is that I see no such implicit vouching. The majority conflates legitimate factual testimony (\"I told Gerry to make full disclosure\") with illegitimate opining (\"I am sure he did make full disclosure\"). Nothing in the record indicates that the latter belief or opinion was expressed to the jury, either implicitly or explicitly.\n\nIn my opinion, it is not necessarily problematic for a lawyer to testify as a fact witness in the manner that occurred here. In this day and age, I think it highly unlikely that jurors would accord greater weight to a lawyer's testimony than to anyone else's, and certainly nothing in this bizarre case, where a lawyer was on trial for murder, would lead a juror to think that lawyers are trusted professionals to whom deference is owed. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e564\u003c/span\u003e In any event, even if it was error to admit Lyons' testimony, I agree that it was harmless error.\n\n2. Capano's Allocution\n\nThe majority has decided that the trial court committed error in restricting Capano's right of allocution. While I agree that any error in this context would have been harmless, I am forced to concur separately because I conclude that there was no error at trial.\n\nAs this Court recognized recently in Shelton v. State, \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e565\u003c/span\u003e allocution, at present, serves two purposes for a convicted murderer: it permits him to ask for mercy and to attempt to impress a jury with his feelings of remorse. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e566\u003c/span\u003e The Shelton Court, purporting to rely on Superior Court Criminal Rule 32(a)(1)(c) and 11 Del. C. § 4209(c)(2), found that it was error for the trial court to limit a defendant, during an allocution not subject to cross-examination, from arguing that the jury had made factual errors leading erroneously to a finding of guilt. In my opinion, however, nothing in the Superior Court Rule or the death penalty statute mandates that a defendant be permitted to attack collaterally a jury verdict in this manner. To allow a defendant to recast disputed facts in a way favorable to him, after the jury has already reached its verdict, goes beyond the legitimate evocation of mercy and communication of remorse and also attempts to cause the jury to doubt its own verdict in a way that is not subject to cross-examination or other effective correction by the prosecution. In short, such a proceeding is likely to produce confusion and other mischief. To the extent the majority concludes that Shelton requires that Capano should have been allowed to present again a factual theory which the jury had rejected, as evidenced by its conviction, it is my opinion that Shelton itself is in error and should be overruled. Therefore, on the allocution issue, I respectfully concur in the result, but I do not join in that aspect of the Opinion finding that the trial court's limitations on allocution constituted error.\n\nAPPENDIX A\n\nCases Decided Under 11 Del.

C. § 4209(g) an automatic appeal was docketed in this Court on March 22, 1999. While that automatic appeal was pending, Capano filed his own timely appeal on April 9, 1999. These appeals were later consolidated. Before further proceedings were undertaken in this Court, Capano moved to remand to the Superior Court to permit him to present a motion for new trial in the Superior Court. That motion to remand was granted on May 4, 1999, and this Court retained jurisdiction. After briefing and argument, the motion was denied in an opinion dated September 1, 1999. See State v. Capano, Del. Super., Cr. A. No. N97-11-0720, Lee, J., (Sept. 1, 1999) (Mem. Op.). Thereafter, while his appeal was pending, Capano filed a procedural motion requesting a limited remand in connection with his contention that the trial judge should have recused himself. The motion was denied in an opinion dated March 17, 2000. See Capano v. State, Del. Supr., 758 A.2d 499 (2000).

Confining Whalen to its context (that is, to rebut an assertion of coercion of a confession), the holding does not apply to the present case, and it is not a proper authority to admit Lyons' testimony.

Even on the assumption that cash was needed to \"shock\" Fahey, Capano was pressed for an explanation of why he went to Gerry rather than going to another branch of his bank, just one block away from his customary branch. Such a step would have dealt with Capano's professed embarrassment at going to the same teller three days in a row. Id. at 251-52. Additionally, Capano was pressed for an explanation of what he had done with the money, which, according to his testimony, Fahey \"threw . . . in [his] face.\" Tr. of 12/30/98, at 25.

He contended that he never told Gerry that he needed money to pay extortionists and that the extortionist story was essentially the product of Gerry's imagination. Tr. of 12/30/98, at 28-29. According to Capano, when Capano asked Gerry for the loan, Gerry inquired why Capano needed the money. Tr. of 12/29/98, at 232-239. Gerry then \"brought up the idea of extortion,\" which Capano dismissed by saying \"yeah, yeah, yeah. . . .\" Id. at 234.

Tr. of 10/27/98, at 22 (\"She was someone who was very memorable . . . a very friendly, polite young woman\"); id. at 29, 37-48. Similarly, Dr. Sullivan testified that Fahey sought to end her involvement with Capano because the relationship was \"unhealthy\" and because he was \"incredibly controlling and possessive.\" Tr. of 10/29/98, at 17-18. In a similar vein, Dr. Sullivan testified that Fahey was concerned that Capano would have her kidnapped. Tr. of 10/29/98, at 36, 37. Dr. Johnson testified that Fahey was \"terrified\" because a prominent married man whom she was dating (that is, Capano) \"had come to her apartment quite late at night . . . bolted the door shut\" and yelled at her because she had started to date Scanlon. Tr. of 10/29/98, at 16.

What a controlling, manipulative, insecure jealous maniac.\" Tr. of 10/28/98, at 155-56. Fahey's friend, Jill Morrison, similarly testified that Fahey thought that Capano was trying to control her life, Tr. of 11/4/98, at 47, and that Capano was upset about Fahey's relationship with Scanlon. Tr. of 11/4/98, at 61-62 (\"He [Capano] was upset and this was because she was dating Mike [Scanlon]\"). Morrison also described several incidents indicating that Capano was vindictive and that he was determined to maintain his relationship with Fahey. Tr. of 11/4/98, at 53-62.

Specifically, the statement (1) must be relevant and material; (2) must relate to an existing state of mind of the declarant at the time of its making; (3) must have been communicated in a natural manner; (4) must be made under circumstances dispelling suspicion; and (5) must contain \"no suggestion of sinister motives.\" Id.; see also Forrest v.

In Subsection C we deal with our separate, alternative holding under D.R.E. 803(4) regarding the admissibility of Fahey's statements to her psychotherapists under the medical diagnosis or treatment exception.\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003e140. See Fulminante, 975 P.2d at 85 (\"[T]he statement must be limited to a declaration showing the state of mind and not include a description of the factual occurrence that engendered that state of mind.\"). Because we have concluded that the specific incidents that Fahey described to her friends and psychotherapists are not admissible under the state of mind exception, there is no need to address the limitations on the admissibility of bad act evidence established in D.R.E. 404 and in Getz v. State, Del. Supr., 538 A.2d 726, 734 (1988) or the prejudice balance under D.R.E. 403.\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003e141. The state of mind exception authorizes the admission of a \"statement of the declarant's then existing state of mind, emotion, sensation or physical condition.\" D.R.E. 803(3) (emphasis added). To be admissible under Rule 803(3), the statement must reflect the declarant's state of mind at the time that the statement is made. Thus, a statement reflecting the declarant's memory of a past state of mind cannot meet this contemporaneity requirement. For example, Fahey's statement to Morrison that she was frightened during the garage incident is not admissible as a then existing state of mind, whereas Fahey's statements that she was upset with or afraid of Capano at the time of the statement is admissible under the exception.\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003e142. The same analysis applies to Dr. Johnson's and Dr. Sullivan's testimony recounting Fahey's description of various incidents during the course of Fahey's relationship with Capano. For example, Dr. Sullivan testified that \"apparently Mr. Capano got into the apartment and became very angry and he threatened to take away gifts, the air conditioner, things he felt he did not want to be present while she might be dating somebody else.\" Tr. of 11/2/98, at 44-45. Fahey's description of this event to Dr. Sullivan reflects Fahey's memory of the event, rather than her existing mental or emotional state at the time of the conversation.\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003e143. For example, Jennifer Bartels-Houghton testified, regarding emails Capano sent: \"She got upset and said that this man would not get the hint, that she did not want to be more than friends, and he was bothering her, sending her emails and asking her to go out to dinner.\" Dr. Kaye testified: \"She was still fearful of him, was not convinced that he was ever going to let go, but in her own mind, she had wanted that to be over a long time ago.\" Tr. of 10/27/98, at 33. These statements concerning the deterioration of their relationship are relevant to motive and intent. See Gattis v. State, Del. Supr., 637 A.2d 808, 818 (1994) (\"In a prosecution for homicide arising out of a marital or romantic relationship, evidence of previous discord between the victim and the defendant is clearly material to issues of motive and intent.\"); see also Donley, 878 F.2d at 738 (\"The government properly sought to persuade the jury to infer from her statements that she had such a plan and, in turn, to infer from that plan and the defendant's awareness of it that he had a motive for murder other than the one he claimed.\"); People v.

We find the trial judge did not abuse his discretion in refusing to hold an evidentiary hearing as to the allegations set forth in the juror's letter or in refusing to grant a new trial.\"). Capano argues that the holding in Fisher v. State, Del. Supr., 690 A.2d 917, 918 (1996), supports his position that the trial court is obligated to conduct an in-depth investigation of allegations of serious juror misconduct. In Fisher, the Court remanded to the trial court for a hearing on possible racial bias among jurors after the trial court \"denied summarily\" the defendant's motion for a new trial. Fisher presents a different situation than the present case because the Capano trial court did not deny Capano's motion for a new trial \"summarily.\" Although the judge did not conduct a juror-by-juror investigation, the judge did not dismiss the allegations out-of-hand. On the contrary, the trial court interviewed the lone complaining juror and concluded that the juror's testimony lacked credibility.\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003e340.

See Walton v. Arizona, 497 U.S. 639, 647-48 (1990). If a trial judge can make sentencing determinations under Walton and can disregard a jury's recommendation under Spaziano, 468 U.S. at 464-65, there is no reason to think that the jury's recommendation under the Delaware statute constitutes \"factfinding required for imposition of a higher sentence.\" Jones, 526 U.S. at 250 (emphasis added).\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003e498.

In Walton, the Supreme Court upheld Arizona's death penalty statute. Under the Arizona scheme, once a jury returns a guilty verdict for first degree murder, the trial court holds a separate sentencing hearing to determine whether aggravating and mitigating factors are present. See Walton, 497 U.S. at 643-44. The trial court is directed to impose a death sentence where the court finds beyond a reasonable doubt that one aggravating factor is present and where the court finds that the mitigating factors do not outweigh the aggravating factors.

The instruction requested by Capano is as follows: This statutory aggravating circumstance applies to those murders which may be characterized as executions (or contract murders). This statutory aggravating circumstance requires a finding of heightened premeditation, i.e., a cold-blooded intent to kill that is more contemplative, more methodical, more calculating and controlled than that necessary to sustain a conviction of first degree murder. This instruction is drawn from State v. Manley, Del. Super., 1997 Del. Super., Cr. I.D. Nos. 9511007022, 9511006992, Barron, J. (Jan. 10, 1997) (ORDER). See also Stevenson v. State, Del.
