    "body": "[EDITOR'S NOTE: The page numbers of this document may appear to be out of sequence; however, this pagination accurately reflects the pagination of the original published documents.]\n\nMotion for rehearing was granted solely upon the issue of whether or not conviction for armed criminal action, § 559.225, RSMo Supp. 1976, and robbery in the first degree with a dangerous and deadly weapon, §§ 560.120, RSMo 1969, and 560.135, RSMo Supp. 1975, arising out of the same transaction, violated the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution based upon reexamination of the case in light of Albernaz v. United States, 450 U.S. 333, 101 S.Ct. 1137, 67 L.Ed.2d 275 (1981).\n\nOn January 15, 1980, this Court in Sours v. State, 593 S.W.2d 208 (Mo. banc 1980) (hereafter Sours I) held that conviction under both of these statutes for acts arising out of the same transaction constituted double jeopardy under the United States Constitution. Double Jeopardy under our own Constitution, Article I, Section 19, is limited to prosecution or conviction only after having been \"once acquitted.\"\n\nOn May 27, 1980, the United States Supreme Court vacated Sours I and remanded the case for consideration in light of Whalen v. United States, 445 U.S. 684, 100 S.Ct. 1432, 63 L.Ed.2d 715 (1980). Missouri v. Sours, 446 U.S. 962, 100 S.Ct. 2935, 64 L.Ed.2d 820 (1980).\n\nOn August 18, 1980, this Court reconsidered Sours I in light of Whalen and issued its opinion in State v. Sours, 603 S.W.2d 592 (Mo. banc 1980) (hereafter Sours II), which opinion is attached as Appendix I to this opinion. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e1\u003c/span\u003e\n\nOn January 26, 1981, in Missouri v. Sours, U.S. , 101 S.Ct. 953, 67 L.Ed.2d 118 (1981) (Sours II), the United States Supreme Court denied the application of the State of Missouri for certiorari. The Missouri courts of appeals continued to rule a number of cases based upon the authority of Sours II. After March 23, 1981, the United States Supreme Court granted certiorari on several of these courts of appeals cases and remanded them together with three by this Court \"for further consideration in light of Albernaz. . . .\" \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e2\u003c/span\u003e\n\nIn view of the number of cases involved and for the purpose of avoiding the delays which would result in waiting for mandates, transfers of the cases to this Court, and docketing and hearing in this Court, we chose the instant case as the vehicle for accomplishing the reexamination \"in light of Albernaz. \" We granted the motion for rehearing and limited briefs and arguments to \"examination in light of Albernaz. \" The parties, public defenders and prosecutors were invited to participate in briefing and arguing the issue on May 27, 1981.\n\nReexamination in Light of Albernaz\n\nHaving traversed the almost identical stormy course as that of our brothers in Delaware, we too perceive ourselves as sailing toward the \"Sargasso Sea\" \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e3\u003c/span\u003e mentioned in Albernaz and described in Hunter v. Delaware, A.2d , (Del. 1981), decided May 12, 1981.\n\nOur reading of Albernaz persuades us that the United States Supreme Court was dealing with two separate crimes each involving proof of an element different from and not included in the other. Our case and its predecessors, Sours I and Sours II, are distinguishable from Albernaz for the reason that having proved every fact and element necessary to prove robbery with a dangerous and deadly weapon, you have proved every element and every fact required for proof of armed criminal action. We are in complete agreement with the Hunter court that \"The definitive ultimate and penultimate sentences of Albernaz are dicta, unnecessary to reach the Court's Conclusion in that case; . . .\" A.2d at (emphasis in original).\n\nWe are not without understanding of the frustration of the Hunter court when in seeming desperation they concluded:\n\nThe cloud thus remaining over the law of double jeopardy notwithstanding, we must consider ourselves bound by the majority rule now apparently emerging out of the 'Sargasso Sea' and manifesting itself in the last paragraphs of Albernaz. Although dicta, the emergence of the evolving rule stands unmistakably clear by virtue of the vote of 6 to 3, cast in the face of the flat contradiction of the Concurring Justices, including the author of Whalen.\n\nApplying the rule of Albernaz to the instant case, we now hold that where the General Assembly intended, as we have found that it did in § 613(1) and § 1447, to impose multiple punishments for two offenses not satisfying the Blockburger test, imposition of two consecutive sentences by a court as a result of a single criminal trial does not violate the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment.\n\nThe Hunter majority in this Court reluctantly follows the evolving rule of the majority of the United States Supreme Court in Albernaz. The Rule of Supremacy prevails on this issue, however, and trusting, as we must, that the dicta in Albernaz will soon become the clear and unquestioned rule of law to be followed, we now hold as follows in the instant case: Our Conclusion 'that § 1447 creates an offense distinct from the underlying § 613 (1) felony of Assault First Degree, and that it was the legislative intent to subject this defendant to multiple penalties, for the single criminal act in which she engaged,' 420 A.2d at 124, is determinative upon the issue of double jeopardy. It follows therefrom that the imposition of multiple sentences upon the defendant for the two offenses in this case does not violate the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment.\n\nAny statement contrary to the above, contained in the previous Hunter opinions of this Court, is hereby abandoned.\n\nThe judgment below now stands AFFIRMED.\n\nA.2d at (footnote omitted).\n\nIn Sours I, a case identical to this case, we followed what we perceived to be the teaching of Illinois v. Vitale, 447 U.S. 410, 100 S.Ct. 2260, 65 L.Ed.2d 228 (1980); Simpson v. United States, 435 U.S. 6, 98 S.Ct. 909, 55 L.Ed.2d 70 (1978); Harris v. Oklahoma, 433 U.S. 682, 97 S.Ct. 2912, 53 L.Ed.2d 1054 (1977); Brown v. Ohio, 432 U.S. 161, 97 S.Ct. 2221, 53 L.Ed.2d 187 (1977); Jeffers v. United States, 432 U.S. 137, 97 S.Ct. 2207, 53 L.Ed.2d 168 (1977); Iannelli v. United States, 420 U.S. 770, 95 S.Ct. 1284, 43 L.Ed.2d 616 (1975); North Carolina v. Pearce, 395 U.S. 711, 89 S.Ct. 2072, 23 L.Ed.2d 656 (1969); and Blockburger v. United States, 284 U.S. 299, 52 S.Ct. 180, 76 L.Ed. 306 (1932), and held that conviction on both the offense of armed criminal action and the offense of robbery with a dangerous and deadly weapon constituted multiple punishment for the same offense arising out of a single transaction and was violative of the double jeopardy clause of the fifth amendment. When Sours I was vacated by the United States Supreme Court and we were directed to re-examine the case in light of Whalen. We concluded that the unique wording of the Missouri statutes and clear, positive and unequivocal intent of the legislature to authorize multiple punishments did not leave us the same option which the Court had in Whalen -- that of finding that Congress intended not to twice punish thereby permitting the Court to reserve the constitutional question of double jeopardy. We conclude that we had no alternative other than to meet the double jeopardy issue. We concluded that we should affirm our prior holding that multiple punishment for the same offense was violative of the double jeopardy clause as we believed it to be construed by Vitale, Simpson, Harris, Brown, Jeffers, Iannelli, Pearce and Blockburger. On January 26, 1981, the United States Supreme Court entered its order denying the petition of the state for certiorari in Sours II. Following the same reasoning expressed by the Hunter court, a large majority of the United States Supreme Court tacitly, if not in fact, sustained our position as stated in Sours II. Only Justices Blackmun and Rehnquist noted that they \"Would dismiss the petition for a writ of certiorari as moot.\" U.S. at , 101 S.Ct. at 953, 67 L.Ed.2d at 118.\n\nUnder these circumstances we are again compelled to affirm our prior position, as expressed in Sours II, and hold that by enactment of these two statutes the Missouri Legislature intended to twice punish the appellant, and that such multiple punishments for the same offense arising out of the same transaction violates the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution. Until such time as the Supreme Court of the United States declares clearly and unequivocally that the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution does not apply to the legislative branch of government, we cannot do other than what we perceive to be our duty to refuse to enforce multiple punishments for the same offense arising out of a single transaction.\n\nThe Division One opinion of Welborn, C., heretofore adopted by the Court en banc as its principal opinion, is upon this rehearing again adopted as the opinion of the Court en banc. Upon reexamination of the case in light of Albernaz, we conclude that the judgment of conviction on Count II for armed criminal action must be reversed as set forth in the principal opinion. The Division One opinion of Welborn, C., adopted by the Court en banc as its principal opinion and filed herein March 9, 1981, is now ordered published together with this opinion on rehearing.\n\nConviction on Count I, affirmed.\n\nConviction on Count II, reversed.\n\nDonnelly, C.J., Seiler, Morgan, Higgins, and Bardgett, JJ., concur; Rendlen, J., concurs in part and Dissents in part in separate opinion filed.\n\nRobert Haggard was convicted of robbery, first degree, §§ 560.120 RSMo 1969, and 560.135, RSMo 1975 Supp., and armed criminal action, § 559.225, RSMo 1976 Supp. The jury assessed punishment at 15 years on the robbery count and 18 years on the armed criminal action count. Judgment and sentence were entered accordingly, the sentences to run concurrently.\n\nAppellant raises seven points of error: (1) refusal of requested continuance; (2) permitting the State to amend the information on the day of trial; (3) permitting the State to endorse a witness on the day of trial; (4) conviction for both robbery first degree and armed criminal action violated protection against double jeopardy; (5) prosecutor commented on defendant's failure to testify; (6) the giving of Instruction No. 7, MAI-CR 2.70; and (7) allowing a witness's previous consistent statement to be read for rehabilitation. Affirmed as to the robbery count and reversed as to the armed criminal action count.\n\nThe sufficiency of the evidence is not questioned. The jury could reasonably have found that, in March, 1978, Haggard, in the company of Kenneth Smith, Wilbur Barnett and Mark Goodman, drove a truck to a point about a quarter of a mile from Casey's General Store in Sedalia. Haggard left the truck with a rifle and a stocking cap and walked toward the store. A short time later Haggard ran back to the truck with the gun and a paper sack containing money.\n\nGoodman and Barnett testified that they were with Haggard during the evening. They testified that appellant obtained the rifle and they were with him when a part of the barrel and a part of the butt were sawed off. They stated that, after appellant returned to the truck with the sack of money, he divided the money with Smith and Barnett, but Goodman refused a share.\n\nThe cashier at Casey's testified that, a little after 10:00 P.M., a man entered the store. He pulled a stocking cap over his face so she was unable to observe his full facial features. The man had a gun which she identified as similar to the one taken from Haggard's truck after his arrest. At the man's order she placed the money from the cash register in a paper sack which the man took and left. She testified that Haggard matched the stature of the man who had committed the robbery and the part of the face which she could see before he pulled his stocking cap down matched that part of Haggard's face. A short time later, officers stopped Haggard's vehicle and discovered the sawed-off rifle in it. Some $132 was recovered from Haggard and two of his companions.\n\nAppellant contends the court erred in denying his application for a continuance. The case was removed from Pettis County to Cooper County on a change of venue. One continuance was granted to the defendant and the case was set for trial on June 12, 1978. Friday before the trial was set on Monday, Haggard's counsel requested a continuance, stating that he had taken the depositions of three witnesses, including Barnett and Goodman, on May 31, and had received the typed copy on that day. He stated he would not have time to read the depositions to prepare for cross-examination and possible impeachment by Monday. Two of the depositions were 25 pages in length and one about seven pages. Counsel who argued for the continuance and who was to try the case had taken the depositions.\n\nAppellant agrees an application for a continuance is addressed to the sound discretion of the trial court and that he has the burden to demonstrate that the denial of a continuance was prejudicial to his case. State v. Lane, 551 S.W.2d 900, 906[13-16] (Mo.App. 1977). Here, appellant does not demonstrate any such prejudice. He merely speculates that, if counsel had had additional time to read the depositions, he might have been able to discover information which could be used as impeachment against one of the witnesses. Since the same counsel had taken the depositions about ten days prior to his appearance to request a continuance, he knew what the witnesses had said and could have conducted any investigation he desired during that time. Rather, counsel simply said he would not have time to read three very short depositions between Friday and Monday. No prejudice has been shown and no abuse of discretion has been demonstrated.\n\nAppellant also complains of the court's denial of his oral request for continuance, made on the day of trial. At that time, defense counsel stated that a reading of Goodman's deposition over the weekend before the trial date had recalled to counsel the deponent's testimony regarding his having spent one year at the Warren E. Hearnes Correctional Center. According to counsel, the deponent's testimony gave some hint of treatment for a mental disorder, although the witness denied that he had been treated for mental disease. Counsel stated that he wanted to check the records of the witness's stay at the institution in order to determine whether or not it might provide a basis for impeachment of the witness. He had been unable to obtain the records over the weekend.\n\nThe trial court's refusal of a continuance on this basis was not an abuse of its discretion to which, appellant acknowledges, the request was directed. Trial counsel had heard the deposition testimony and, knowing the approaching trial date, could have pursued the inquiry before receipt of the transcript of the deposition. No showing was made that the ruling deprived defendant of evidence which might have been of value. Counsel had adequate opportunity to prepare on this issue and his assertion that the court's ruling denied defendant assistance of counsel is without merit.\n\nAppellant contends the court erred in permitting the State to amend the information on the day of trial to delete the words \"did knowingly act together and with a common purpose of committing the acts hereinafter set out with two other individuals, and * * * .\" The effect of the amendment was to charge defendant with the commission of the crimes while acting alone instead of charging that he committed them while acting with others. In State v. West, 484 S.W.2d 191, 195[4,5] (Mo. 1972), the court held there was no abuse of discretion in allowing an amendment to the information during the trial to charge that the defendant acted with others. The court held the distinction between principals and accessories has been virtually eliminated and all persons who participate in a crime may be charged, tried, convicted and punished alike. The amendment here was to delete the allegation that Haggard acted with others, but the reasoning of West applies. No additional or different offenses was charged and all the elements of robbery first degree were stated in both the original and the amended information. The court did not err in allowing the amendment.\n\nNo error may be predicated upon the court's allowing the State to endorse a witness on the day of trial. The prosecutor had previously informed defense counsel of his intention to call the witness, a police officer, and defendant's counsel had taken the officer's deposition. When the State requested permission to endorse the witness, defendant's counsel replied: \"I see no objection to indorsing the witness.\" Such waiver and the prior knowledge of defense counsel regarding the witness precludes any finding of error in the trial court's exercise of discretion.\n\nAppellant contends the prosecuting attorney in his opening statement impermissibly commented that the defendant might not produce any evidence. During his opening statement the prosecutor said: \"After all the evidence has been heard, and I assume there will be eight to ten witnesses called by the State, I do not know how many called by the defendant, if any.\" Appellant argues that by this statement the prosecutor was calling the attention of the jury to the defendant's right not to testify and by this means hoped to obtain a favorable inference that the failure to testify would indicate guilt.\n\nThe prosecutor in no manner commented upon the failure of the defendant to testify, there having been no opportunity for him to do so. The statement was simply that the State had eight to ten witnesses to call and the prosecutor did not know how many, if any, witnesses the defendant might call. This was not a comment on the defendant's right not to testify. See State v. Terry, 472 S.W.2d 426, 430[6] (Mo. banc 1971), vacated in part 408 U.S. 940 (1972).\n\nAppellant contends the court erred in giving Instruction No. 7, MAI-CR 2.70. This instruction told the jury that the defendant was charged with a separate offense in each count submitted and that each offense and the evidence and law applicable to it should be considered separately. Appellant contends because of the inter-relationship between the charge of robbery first degree and the charge of armed criminal action this instruction was confusing.\n\nSeparate instructions were given to the jury concerning the robbery and armed criminal action charges. Instruction No. 7 was required by MAI-CR in that situation. Rule 20.02(a). Instruction No. 7 read with other instructions correctly informed the jury as to the necessary elements of each offense. Appellant complains that No. 7 was confusing because it would have been impossible for the jury to isolate the evidence applicable to each charge. That is not what the instruction required. It required only that, as to each of the substantive charges, the jury find the facts required under the instruction as to each offense. The complaint against Instruction No. 7 is without merit. State v. Tilley, 569 S.W.2d 346, 348-349[4-6] [7] (Mo. App. 1978); Simms v. State, 568 S.W.2d 801, 804-805[4]-[7-8] (Mo. App. 1978).\n\nAppellant contends the court erred in allowing the State to read a statement Mark Goodman had given to police officers. On crossexamination Goodman was asked if he had ever told anyone that he did not know who robbed the store. Goodman denied ever making such a statement. By use of his deposition, counsel brought out that Goodman had said that he told a police officer that he did not know who had robbed the store. The police officer who took Goodman's statement was called as a witness and was allowed, over defendant's objection, to read the entire statement given by Goodman. There is no question the statement was given prior to the deposition testimony and there is no question that Goodman was impeached by use of his deposition. Appellant relies upon State v. Fleming, 354 Mo. 31, 188 S.W.2d 12 (1945). In Fleming the court held that a prior consistent statement could be used only to the extent necessary to counter the subject on which the witness had been impeached. The court held that matters foreign to the subject on which the witness had been impeached were incompetent and inadmissible. See also State v. Askew, 570 S.W.2d 798 (Mo. App. 1978). Here, the statement given by Goodman and read to the jury covered the activities of the entire evening and was not confined to the subject matter on which he had been impeached. Therefore, the court should have confined the reading of the statement to only that portion covering the subject matter on which Goodman had been impeached.\n\nHowever, even if the reading of the entire statement for purposes of rehabilitation was error, there remains the question of its prejudicial effect, if any. In State v. Degraffenreid, 477 S.W.2d 57, 64[14] (Mo. banc 1972), the court stated: \"rror in the admission of evidence should not be declared harmless unless it is so without question.\" The court also stated: \"We also are mindful that error which in a close case might call for a reversal may be disregarded as harmless when the evidence of guilt is strong.\"\n\nApplying these standards, the error in reading the entire statement of Goodman was harmless. There is strong evidence of guilt in this case with the testimony of Goodman and Barnett coupled with the testimony of the cashier. Further, the statement of Goodman which was read was identical to his in-court testimony and thus was cumulative. Even observing the caution noted in Degraffenreid, with reference to cumulative evidence, the admission of the statement was both cumulative and harmless.\n\nUnder Sours v. State, 593 S.W.2d 208 (Mo. banc 1980); vacated Missouri v. Sours, U.S. , 64 L.Ed.2d 820 (1980); on remand Sours v. State, S.W.2d (Mo. banc No. 61458, August 18, 1980), the conviction for armed criminal action cannot stand.\n\nThe judgment of conviction on Count I for robbery in the first degree is affirmed. The judgment of conviction on Count II for armed criminal action is reversed.\n\nRobert R. Welborn\n\nCommissioner\n\nAPPENDIX I\n\n592 Mo. 603 SOUTH WESTERN REPORTER, 2d SERIES\n\nWilliam Scott SOURS, Appellant,\n\nv.\n\nSTATE of Missouri, Respondent.\n\nNo. 61458.\n\nSupreme Court of Missouri, En Banc.\n\nAug. 18, 1980.\n\nDefendant moved to set aside convictions based on guilty pleas to information in two counts charging robbery first degree by means of dangerous and deadly weapons and armed criminal action. The Circuit Court, Jasper County, Ben F. Pyle, J., denied the motion, and defendant appealed. The Supreme Court, Welliver, J., 593 S.W.2d 208, reversed in part and affirmed in part. On remand, 100 S.Ct. 2935, the Supreme Court, Welliver, J., held that Missouri armed criminal action statute which permitted conviction on charge of robbery first degree and on the same facts permitted conviction for armed criminal action violated the double jeopardy clause.\n\nAffirmed in part and reversed in part.\n\nDonnelly, J., filed Dissenting opinion in which Rendlen, J., concurred.\n\nRendlen, J., filed Dissenting opinion.\n\n1. Robbery - 11\n\nA conviction under statute covering armed criminal action for committing robbery first degree by, with, or through the use, assistance, or aid of a dangerous or deadly weapon cannot be had without proving all elements of offense of robbery first degree. V.A.M.S. § 571.015; §§ 559.225, 560.120, 560.135 (Repealed).\n\n2. Weapons - 4\n\nGeneral Assembly in adopting armed criminal action statute clearly expressed its intent to authorize conviction and punishment for armed criminal action and for the underlying felony. V.A.M.S. § 559.225 (Repealed).\n\n3. Statutes - 142\n\nSince Constitution prohibits the General Assembly from amending statutes without setting forth in full the statutes so amended, court could not construe armed criminal action statute as a mere punishment-enhancement statute which amends by implication numerous felony statutes. V.A.M.S. § 559.225 (Repealed); V.A.M.S. Const. Art. 3, § 28.\n\n4. Federal Courts - 386\n\nState Supreme Court's construction of state statute is binding on the United States Supreme Court.\n\n5. - 196\n\nMissouri armed criminal action statute which permitted conviction on charge of robbery first degree and on the same facts permitted conviction for armed criminal action violated the double jeopardy clause.\n\nDavid Robards, Public Defender, Joplin, for appellant.\n\nJohn Ashcroft, Atty. Gen., Steven W. Garrett, Asst. Atty. Gen., Jefferson City, for respondent.\n\nWELLIVER, Judge.\n\nAppellant, William Scott Sours, pleaded guilty to two counts of an information filed June 20, 1977. Count I charged appellant with first degree robbery, § 560.120, RSMo 1969, and § 560.135, RSMo Supp. 1975; Count II charged armed criminal action, § 559.225, RSMo Supp. 1976 (Now § 571.015, RSMo 1978). A separate punishment was imposed for each count. Appellant sought relief from his convictions in a collateral proceeding under Rule 27.26. In Sours v. State, Mo., 593 S.W.2d 208 (1980), we reversed the judgment of the trial court insofar as it denied appellant relief from his conviction for armed criminal action, and vacated and set aside that conviction on the ground that the conviction placed appellant twice in jeopardy for the same offense. We affirmed the judgment insofar as it denied appellant relief from his conviction for robbery first degree. The United States Supreme Court vacated our decision and remanded the case for reconsideration in the light of Whalen v. United States, 445 U.S. 684, 100 S.Ct. 1432, 63 L.Ed.2d 715 (1980). Missouri v. Sours, U.S. , 100 S.Ct. 2935, 64 L.Ed.2d 820. The detailed facts and prior procedural history of this case may be found in this Court's earlier opinion, 593 S.W.2d at 210.\n\nThe United States Supreme Court has never decided whether imposing separate punishments in a single proceeding both for the offense of committing a felony by means of a dangerous and deadly weapon and for the commission of the felony violates the double jeopardy clause of the federal Constitution. The Court expressly declined to rule on this issue in Simpson v. United States, 435 U.S. 6, 98 S.Ct. 909, 55 L.Ed.2d 70 (1978). Cf. Whalen v. United States, 445 U.S. 684, 100 S.Ct. 1432, 63 L.Ed.2d 715 (1980). Each time a similar double jeopardy question has been before the United States Supreme Court, it has found it unnecessary to address the constitutional question, because it has been able to find that the legislature did not intent to separately punish the two offenses involved. Whalen v. United States, 445 U.S. 684, 100 S.Ct. 1432, 1435 (1980); Simpson v. United States, 435 U.S. 6, 11, 98 S.Ct. 909, 912, 55 L.Ed.2d 70 (1978); Iannelli v. United States, 420 U.S. 770, 785-86 nn. 17-18, 95 S.Ct. 1284, 43 L.Ed.2d 616 (1975). See Jeffers v. United States, 432 U.S. 137, 155, 97 S.Ct. 2207, 53 L.Ed.2d 168 (1977). No United States Supreme Court opinion has considered a statute that contained wording similar to or identical to that found in Missouri's armed criminal action statute.\n\nIn Whalen, the defendant was convicted of rape, D.C.Code Ann. § 22-2801, and of felony-murder, i.e., the killing of the rape victim in the course of the rape, D.C.Code Ann. § 22-2401. He was sentenced to consecutive terms of imprisonment of 20 years to life for first degree murder, and of 15 years to life for rape. The District of Columbia Court of Appeals affirmed, 379 A.2d 1152. The United States Supreme Court reversed, holding that under D.C.Code Ann. § 23-112,1a Congress did not intend that multiple punishments be imposed for two offenses arising out of the same criminal transaction unless each offense requires proof of a fact which the other does not. The Court stated that\n\nCongress did not authorize consecutive sentences for rape and for a killing committed in the course of the rape, since it is plainly not the case that \"each provision requires proof of a fact which the other does not.\" A conviction for killing in the course of a rape cannot be had without proving all the elements of the offense of rape. See United States v. Greene, 160 U.S.App.D.C. 21, 489 F.2d 1145, 1158 (1973). Cf. Harris v. Oklahoma, 433 U.S. 682, 682-683, 97 S.Ct. 2912, 2913, 53 L.Ed.2d 1054 [1977].\n\n445 U.S. at 693, 100 S.Ct. at 1439. The Court expressly reserved the question whether, had Congress clearly intended to impose multiple punishments for the same offense, the imposition of such punishment would violate the double jeopardy clause. Before holding that the Court would decide the question of statutory interpretation without deferring to the interpretation of the District of Columbia Court of Appeals, the Court carefully distinguished the question of statutory interpretation from the constitutional question. The Court stated that, if the matter of whether it must defer to the construction given D.C.Code Ann. §§ 22-2801 and 22-2401 by the District of Columbia Court of Appeals were absent, \"we would as a matter of course first decide the petitioner's statutory claim, and, only if that claim were rejected, would we reach the constitutional issue. See Simpson v. United States, 435 U.S. 6, 11-12, 98 S.Ct. 909, 912, 55 L.Ed.2d 70.\" 445 U.S. at 687, 100 S.Ct. at 1435. Accordingly, since the Court did not reject the petitioner's statutory claim, it did not reach the constitutional issue presented.2a\n\nJustice Blackmun, Concurring in the judgment in Whalen (Mr. Justice White filed an opinion Concurring in part and Concurring in the judgment and Mr. Justice Rehnquist filed a Dissenting opinion in which Mr. Chief Justice Burger joined) stated that prior cases had wrongly suggested: that the Double Jeopardy Clause may prevent the imposition of cumulative punishments in situations in which the Legislative Branch clearly intended that multiple penalties be imposed for a single criminal transaction. See Simpson v. United States, 435 U.S. 6, 11-13, 98 S.Ct. 909, 912, 55 L.Ed.2d 70 (1978); Jeffers v. United States, 432 U.S. 137, 155, 97 S.Ct. 2207, 2218, 53 L.Ed.2d 168 (1977) (plurality opinion). I believe that the Court should take the opportunity presented by this case to repudiate those dicta squarely, and to hold clearly that the question of what punishments are constitutionally permissible is not different from the question of what punishments the Legislative Branch intended to be imposed. I must concede that the dicta that seemingly support a contrary view have caused confusion among state courts that have attempted to decipher our pronouncements concerning the Double Jeopardy Clause's role in the are a of multiple punishments.\n\n445 U.S. at 697, 100 S.Ct. at 1441. Clearly, the five Justices who joined in the opinion of the Court in Whalen (Justices Stewart, Powell, Stevens, Brennan, and Marshall) declined Justice Blackmun's invitation to hold that the question of what punishments are constitutionally permissible can be reduced to the question of what punishment the legislature intended to be imposed. The two questions remain distinct.3a The opinion of the Court in Whalen cited Simpson with approval for its separation of the statutory claim from the constitutional issue and for its avoidance of the constitutional issue by finding that the legislature did not intend multiple punishments. 445 U.S. at 686, 100 S.Ct. at 1435.\n\nOur original opinion discussed in detail two recent United States Supreme Court cases in which the question whether the legislature intended to subject the defendant to multiple penalties for a single criminal transaction was carefully distinguished from the question whether cumulative punishments for the two offenses are constitutionally permissible. Simpson v. United States, 435 U.S. 6, 11, 98 S.Ct. 909, 912, 55 L.Ed.2d 70 (1978); Jeffers v. United States, 432 U.S. 137, 155, 97 S.Ct. 2207, 53 L.Ed.2d 168 (1977) (plurality opinion). See Sours v. State, 593 S.W.2d 208, 214-16 (Mo. 1980).\n\nThe decision of the United States Supreme Court to vacate the original judgment of this Court and to remand this case \"for further consideration in light of Whalen v. United States, 445 U.S. 684, 100 S.Ct. 1432, 63 L.Ed.2d 715 (1980),\" mandates that we re-examine the intent of the General Assembly in enacting § 559.225, RSMo Supp. 1976. In Whalen, the Court determined that Congress did not intend to punish the petitioner both for committing rape and for committing a killing in the course of the rape. In reaching this Conclusion, the Court applied to D.C.Code Ann. § 23-112 the doctrine of Blockburger v. United States, 284 U.S. 299, 52 S.Ct. 180, 76 L.Ed. 306 (1932) as \"a rule of statutory construction.\" 445 U.S. at 691, 100 S.Ct. at 1438. In Blockburger, the Court held that \"he applicable rule is that where the same act or transaction constitutes a violation of two distinct statutory provisions, the test to be applied to determine whether there are two offenses or only one, is whether each provision requires proof of a fact which the other does not.\" 284 U.S. at 304, 52 S.Ct. at 182. The Blockburger rule has often been cited by the Court. At times it has been presented as a rule of statutory construction, but more often it has been used as the definition of \"same offense\" for double jeopardy purposes. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e4\u003c/span\u003e Whalen v. United States, 445 U.S. at 692, 100 S.Ct at 1438 (1980); Simpson v. United States, 435 U.S. 6, 11, 98 S.Ct. 909, 912, 55 L.Ed.2d 70 (1978); Brown v. Ohio, 432 U.S. 161, 166, 97 S.Ct. 2221, 2225, 53 L.Ed.2d 187 (1977); Jeffers v. United States, 432 U.S. 137, 151, 97 S.Ct. 2207, 2216, 53 L.Ed.2d 168 (1977) (plurality opinion) (see opinion of White, J., Concurring in part and Dissenting in part, at 158, 97 S.Ct. at 2220); Iannelli v. United States, 420 U.S. 770, 785 n. 17, 95 S.Ct. 1284, 1293 n. 17, 43 L.Ed.2d 616 (1975).\n\nIn Whalen, the Court stated that the Blockburger rule had been consistently relied on ever since it was first stated in 1932:\n\nto determine whether Congress has in a given situation provided that two statutory offenses may be punished cumulatively. The assumption underlying the rule is that Congress ordinarily does not intend to punish the same offense under two different statutes. Accordingly, where two statutory provisions proscribe the \"same offense,\" they are construed not to authorize cumulative punishments in the absence of a clear indication of contrary legislative intent.\n\n455 U.S. at 691, 100 S.Ct. at 1438. (Emphasis added.)\n\nI. LEGISLATIVE INTENT\n\n[1,2] Applying Blockburger as a rule of statutory construction to the armed criminal action statute \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e5\u003c/span\u003e and the statute defining the underlying offense, in this case the robbery first degree statute, \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e6\u003c/span\u003e we find that it is plainly not the case that \"each provision requires proof of a fact which the other does not.\" A conviction for committing robbery first degree \"by, with, or through the use, assistance, or aid of a dangerous or deadly weapon,\" § 559.225, RSMo Supp. 1976, cannot be had without proving all the elements of the offense of robbery first degree. See Illinois v. Vitale, U.S. , , 100 S.Ct. 2260, 65 L.Ed.2d 228 (1980); Whalen, 445 U.S. at 694, 100 S.Ct. at 1439; Harris v. Oklahoma, 433 U.S. 682, 682-83, 97 S.Ct. 2912, 2913, 53 L.Ed.2d 1054 (1977); United States v. Greene, 160 U.S. App.D.C. 21, 489 F.2d 1145, 1158 (1973). Thus, the General Assembly should be presumed not to have intended that punishment be imposed under both statutes. 445 U.S. 691, 100 S.Ct. at 1438. Nevertheless, we find that the General Assembly has in clear and unequivocal terms expressed in § 559.225, RSMo Supp. 1976, its intent to authorize conviction and punishment for armed criminal action and for the underlying felony. In arriving at this Conclusion, we apply every test and standard available to us under Missouri law. First, we consider the plain meaning of the language used. We consider the requirements of our own constitution regarding construction of the statute. We examine every reported decision involving convictions under the armed criminal action statute, in order to discern the application given the statute by Missouri's courts and prosecutors in prior cases. We examine the form of the information or indictment used to charge armed criminal action, both before and after a standard form for charging armed criminal action was approved; and we examine the form of the jury instructions used in submitting a charge of armed criminal action, both before and after a patterned instruction for submitting armed criminal action was approved.\n\nThe language of the armed criminal action statute shows that the General Assembly clearly intended that a defendant convicted of armed criminal action shall be punished for both armed criminal action and for the underlying felony. Section 559.225, RSMo Supp. 1976 (now § 571.015, RSMo 1978) expressly provides that \"any person who commits any felony under the laws of this state by, with, or through the use, assistance, or aid of a dangerous or deadly weapon is also guilty of the crime of armed criminal action.\" (Emphasis added.) The armed criminal action statute provides in three separate subsections for punishment of not less than three years' imprisonment for the first offense, not less than five years' imprisonment for the second offense, and not less than ten years' imprisonment for the third. The legislative intent to impose punishment both for the underlying felony and for the \"compound\" offense of which it is a part is clearly and unambiguously expressed in the following sentence, which appears in each of the three subsections: \"The punishment imposed pursuant to this subsection shall be in addition to any punishment provided by law for the crime committed by, with, or through the use, assistance, or aid of a dangerous or deadly weapon.\" There is nothing ambiguous or uncertain about the meaning of this provision. The statute provides that the state may punish for any felony and also punish for that felony a second time in virtue of its having been committed through the use of a dangerous or deadly weapon. This is the plain meaning of the words used, and it is the unmistakable intent of our General Assembly. Clearly, § 559.225, RSMo Supp. 1976, provides for more than the mere enhancement of the sentence for the underlying felony. It calls for conviction of a second crime and for the imposition of a second sentence. Consequently, we cannot avoid the question whether the double jeopardy clause prohibits the imposition in a single proceeding of multiple punishments for the same offense.\n\nWhat was said in City of St. Louis v. Crowe, 376 S.W.2d 185 (Mo. 1964) is fully applicable to our armed criminal action statute:\n\nThis section of the statutes now under scrutiny is clear and unambiguous in its language. It is not susceptible of more than one construction. Therefore, we may not resort to any extraneous matter because there is no room for construction of such language. State ex rel Bell v. Phillips Petroleum Co., 349 Mo. 360, 160 S.W.2d 764; Rathjen v. Reorganized School Dist. R II of Shelby County, 365 Mo. 518, 284 S.W.2d 516. We have no right to read into the statute an intent which is contrary to the legislative intent made evident by the phraseology employed. State ex inf. Rice ex rel. Allman v. Hawk, 360 Mo. 490, 228 S.W.2d 785; Steggall v. Morris, 363 Mo. 1224, 258 S.W.2d 577. The legislative pronouncement means what it says . . ..\n\n376 S.W.2d at 189-90. See State ex rel. Stevenson v. Kirkpatrick, 536 S.W.2d 740, 741 (Mo. banc 1976); State ex rel. Dravo Corp. v. Spradling, 515 S.W.2d 512, 517 (Mo. 1974); Missourians for Honest Elections v. Missouri Elections Commission, 536 S.W.2d 766, 775 (Mo.App. 1976); Consolidated School District No. 1 of Jackson County v. Bond, 500 S.W.2d 18, 21 (Mo.App. 1973). See also J. Sutherland, 2A Statutes and Statutory Construction, § 46.01, pp. 48-49 (C. Sands 4th ed. 1973).\n\n[3] We note that we are not free to construe the armed criminal action statute as a mere punishment-enhancement statute which amends by implication numerous felony statutes, because Mo.Const. art. III, § 28 prohibits the General Assembly from amending statutes without setting forth in full the statutes so amended. Sours v. State, 593 S.W.2d 208, 222 n. 10 (Mo. banc 1980); State v. Valentine, 584 S.W.2d 92, 96 (Mo. banc 1979). Cf. State v. Hudson, 562 S.W.2d 416 (Tenn. 1978).\n\nThe uniformity of the interpretation and application of § 559.225, RSMo Supp. 1976 ( § 571.015, RSMo 1978), confirms that it plainly authorizes punishment both for armed criminal action and for the underlying felony. Following the original Sours opinion our prosecutors and penal authorities indicated informally to this Court that they believed that as many as four hundred to six hundred prior convictions might be affected by the opinion. In the four years since the enactment of the statute, the appellate courts of this state have been called upon literally dozens of times to review convictions for both armed criminal action and the underlying felony. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e7\u003c/span\u003e In none of these cases was it ever questioned that the legislature intended to say exactly what it said in the armed criminal action statute. No case has been discovered where the armed criminal action statute has not been understood by our trial and appellate Judges and by our prosecutors, assistant attorneys general, and Attorney General to mean that punishment may be imposed once for a felony and a second time (\"in addition to\") for the same felony if it was committed by the use, aid, or assistance of a dangerous or deadly weapon. No amount of analysis premised on presumptions concerning legislative intent can obscure the fact that § 559.225, RSMo Supp. 1976, provides that a person guilty of armed criminal action shall be punished for both of two crimes, one of which by definition includes every element of the other.\n\n[4] This construction of our state statute is binding on the United States Supreme Court. In Memorial Hospital v. Maricopa County, 415 U.S. 250, 94 S.Ct. 1076, 39 L.Ed.2d 306 (1973), the United States Supreme Court stated: \"t is not our function to construe a state statute contrary to the construction given it by the highest court of a State.\" Id. at 256, 94 S.Ct. at 1081; O'Brien v. Skinner, 414 U.S. 524, 531, 94 S.Ct. 740, 743, 38 L.Ed.2d 702 (1973).\n\nIn the reported decisions involving convictions for both armed criminal action and the underlying felony, the armed criminal action charge was entered in a separate count from that charging the underlying felony. The two-count information in the instant case is typical. Count I alleged:\n\nthat on or about the 14th day of May, 1977, in the County of Jasper and State of Missouri, WILLIAM S. SOURS did willfully, unlawfully and feloniously by means of a certain dangerous and deadly weapon, to wit: a handgun, take, stea and carry away Nine Hundred Forty-nine and 06/100 ($949.06) Dollars, lawful money of the United States of America, the money and personal property of Mr. Quick, then and there in the lawful care and custody of Kendall Carnes, by then and there putting the said Kendall Carnes in fear of an immediate injury to his person and then and there did feloniously rob, take, steal and carry away the said money and personal property from the person of, in the presence of and against the will of the said Kendall Carnes with the felonious intent to permanently deprive the owner of the use thereof and to convert the same to his own use.\n\nCount II alleged:\n\nthat on or about the 14th day of May, 1977, in the County of Jasper and State of Missouri, WILLIAM S. SOURS did wilfully, unlawfully and feloniously commit a felony, to-wit: Robbery First Degree, by and with the use, aid and assistance of a dangerous or deadly weapon to wit: a handgun.\n\nSee Jeffers v. United States, 432 U.S. 137, 150 n. 16, 97 S.Ct. 2207, 2216 n. 16, 53 L.Ed.2d 168 (1977).\n\nThis Court recently approved a patterned charge for use in charging armed criminal action, MACH Cr 25.02, the patterned charge is as follows:\n\nThe (Grand Jurors) (Circuit Attorney) (Prosecuting Attorney) of the (City) (County) of , State of Missouri, charge(s) that the defendant, in violation of Section 571.015, RSMo, committed the class A felony of armed criminal action, punishable upon conviction under Section (571.015.1) (571.015.2) (571.015.3), RSMo, in that (on) (on or about) , in the (City) (County) of , State of Missouri, the defendant [insert one of the following, omitting number and brackets]\n\n[1] committed the felony of [name of felony] charged in Count , all allegations of which are incorporated herein by reference, and\n\n[2] committed the felony of [ name of felony, alleging all essential elements thereof with the same specificity as that used in a charge of that felony ], and\n\nThe defendant committed the foregoing felony of [ name of felony ] by, with and through the use, assistance and aid of a (dangerous instrument) (deadly weapon) (, and)\n\n((On) (On or about) in [ identify the particular court and jurisdiction ], the defendant was convicted of the offense of armed criminal action (, and\n\n((On) (On or about) [ date ] in [ identify the particular court and jurisdiction ], the defendant was convicted of the offense of armed criminal action)).\n\nBoth pre-patterned and patterned charges indicate that our statute has been universally interpreted to permit the charging of armed criminal action and the underlying felony in separate counts.\n\nSimilarly, the instructions commonly used to submit to the jury the question of the guilt or innocence of the accused of armed criminal action and of the underlying felony illustrate that the statute has uniformity been interpreted to authorize separate conviction and punishment for both armed criminal action and the underlying felony, as does our recently adopted pattern jury instruction, MAI-Cr 25.02. The verdict-directing instructions used in State v. Treadway, 558 S.W.2d 92 (Mo. banc 1979) are typical:\n\nINSTRUCTION NO. 7\n\nAs to Count I, if you find and believe from the evidence beyond a reasonable doubt:\n\nFirst, that on September 25, 1976, in the City of St. Louis, State of Missouri, Rotha Grimes was in charge of a purse owned by Jerry Hanks, and\n\nSecond, that at that time and place the defendant, acting with another, took the property from Rotha Grimes against her will by causing her to fear immediate injury to her person, and\n\nThird, that the defendant, acting with another, took the property with the intent to permanently deprive Rotha Grimes and Jerri Hanks of the property and to convert it or any part of it to the use of the defendant and another, and\n\nFourth, that the defendant acted either alone or knowingly and with common purpose together with another in the conduct referred to in the above paragraphs,\n\nthen you will find the defendant guilty under Count I of robbery in the first degree.\n\nHowever, if you do not find and believe from the evidence beyond a reasonable doubt each and all of the foregoing, you must find the defendant not guilty of that offense.\n\nMAI-CR 7.60 modified by 2.12 Submitted by the State Given by the Court\n\nINSTRUCTION NO. 8\n\nAs to Count II, if you find and believe from the evidence beyond a reasonable doubt:\n\nFirst, that the defendant, acting with another, committed the crime of robbery in the first degree, a felony, as defined heretofore in Instruction No. 7, and\n\nSecond, that the perpetration of the aforesaid felony was done through the aid or use of a weapon, to-wit; a gun, held by either the defendant or his accomplice, and\n\nThird, that the defendant acted either alone or knowingly and with common purpose together with another in the conduct referred to in the above paragraphs,\n\nthen you will find the defendant guilty under Count II of armed criminal action.\n\nHowever, if you do not find and believe from the evidence beyond a reasonable doubt each and all of the foregoing, then you must find the defendant not guilty under Count II of that offense.\n\nNot in MAI-CR Modified by 2.12 Submitted by the State Given by the Court\n\nINSTRUCTION NO. 9\n\nThe defendant is charged with a separate offense in each Count submitted to you. Each offense and the evidence and law applicable to it should be considered separately. Any evidence which was or has been limited to one of the offenses charged or one purpose should be considered by you as to another offense charged or for any other purpose.\n\nYou may find the defendant guilty or not guilty on any or all of the Counts submitted against him.\n\nMAI-CR 2.70 Given by the Court\n\nOur pattern jury instructions for use in submitting armed criminal action, MAI-Cr2d 25.02, were promulgated effective January 1, 1979. The verdict-directing instruction which was provided for use in cases involving a first offender under the armed criminal action statute, and \"where the underlying felony is charged in a separate count,\" is as follows:\n\n(As to Count , if) (If) you find and believe from the evidence beyond a reasonable doubt:\n\nFirst, that the defendant is guilty under Count of ([ name of the offense, if it is a felony under all circumstances ]) ([ name of the offense, and if it is a misdemeanor under some circumstances and a felony under other circumstances, include the circumstances making it a felony ]), and\n\nSecond, that the defendant committed that offense by, with or through the use, assistance or aid of a (dangerous instrument) (deadly weapon),\n\nthen you will find the defendant guilty (under Count ) of armed criminal action.\n\nHowever, if you do not find and believe from the evidence beyond a reasonable doubt each and all of these propositions, you must find the defendant not guilty of that offense.\n\nIf you do find the defendant guilty (under Count ) of armed criminal action, you will assess and declare his punishment at imprisonment by the division of corrections for a term fixed by you, but not less than three years or more than life imprisonment.\n\nWe have measured the legislature's intent regarding § 559.225, RSMo Supp. 1976 (now § 571.015, RSMo 1978) by every test and standard available to us under the law of Missouri. The Conclusion is inescapable that the Missouri General Assembly did intend to impose punishment for armed criminal action \"in addition to any punishment provided by law for the crime committed by, with, or through the use, assistance, or aid of a dangerous or deadly weapon.\" The General Assembly did clearly intend to impose two separate punishments for armed criminal action and the lesser included offense.\n\nAt this point, the mandate that we reconsider in light of Whalen offers little help or guidance. In Whalen it was determined that Congress had not intended cumulative punishments. The constitutional question could be and was reserved by the Court. In other cases in which the legislative intent was less clear than it is in the case of our armed criminal action statute, the constitutional question also has been reserved. Simpson v. United States, 435 U.S. 6, 11 98 S.Ct. 909, 912, 55 L.Ed.2d 70 (1978); Iannelli v. United States, 420 U.S. 770, 785-86 nn. 17-18, 95 S.Ct. 1284, 1293-1294 nn. 17-18, 43 L.Ed.2d 616 (1975). See Jeffers v. United States, 432 U.S. 137, 155 97 S.Ct. 2207, 2218, 53 L.Ed.2d 187 (1977). The unique wording of the Missouri statute and the clear, positive and unequivocal intent to doubly punish, does not leave us a similar option. The unique wording of the armed criminal action statute dictates that we must bite the bullet and meet the federal constitutional issue. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e8\u003c/span\u003e\n\nII. DOUBLE JEOPARDY AND MULTIPLE PUNISHMENT FOR THE SAME OFFENSE\n\nThere is little we can add to the analysis given the constitutional question in Sours v. State, 593 S.W.2d 208, 211-14, 218-21 (Mo. banc 1980), and we would incorporate that analysis by reference into our opinion today, and reinstate the opinion originally published. The argument can be reduced to a simple syllogism:\n\n(i) The double jeopardy clause of the fifth amendment to the United States Constitution prohibits the state from punishing a person twice for the same offense. Benton v. Maryland, 395 U.S. 784, 793-96, 89 S.Ct. 2056, 2061-63, 23 L.Ed.2d 707 (1969); North Carolina v. Pearce, 395 U.S. 711, 717, 89 S.Ct. 2072, 2076, 23 L.Ed.2d 656 (1969); State v. Neal, 514 S.W.2d 544, 548 (Mo. banc 1974); State v. Parsons, 513 S.W.2d 430, 437-38 (Mo. 1974).\n\n(ii) Armed criminal action and the underlying felony used to prove armed criminal action - in this case, robbery first degree -- are the same offense for double jeopardy purposes under the same evidence test, because it is not the case that proof of robbery requires proof of any fact not also required to prove armed criminal action. Vitale v. United States, U.S. , 100 S.Ct. 2260, 65 L.Ed.2d 228 (1980); Whalen v. United States, 445 U.S. 684, 100 S.Ct. 1432, 1439, 63 L.Ed.2d 715 (1980); Simpson v. United States, 435 U.S. 6, 11, 98 S.Ct. 909, 912, 55 L.Ed.2d 70 (1978); Brown v. Ohio, 432 U.S. 161, 166, 97 S.Ct. 2221, 2225, 53 L.Ed.2d 187 (1977); Jeffers v. United States, 432 U.S. 137, 151, 97 S.Ct. 2207, 2216, 53 L.Ed.2d 168 (1977); Iannelli v. United States, 420 U.S. 770, 785 n. 17, 95 S.Ct. 1284, 1293-1294 n. 17, 43 L.Ed.2d 616 (1975); Harris v. United States, 359 U.S. 19, 23-24, 79 S.Ct. 560, 564, 3 L.Ed.2d 597 (1959); Gore v. United States, 357 U.S. 386, 388-91, 78 S.Ct. 1280, 1282-1283, 2 L.Ed.2d 564 (1958); Blockburger v. United States, 284 U.S. 299, 304, 52 S.Ct. 180, 182, 76 L.Ed. 306 (1932); Carter v. McClaughry, 183 U.S. 365, 394-95, 398, 22 S.Ct. 181, 46 L.Ed. 236 (1902); Morey v. Commonwealth, 108 Mass. 433, 434 (1871).\n\n(iii) Therefore, the double jeopardy clause prohibits separately punishing a person both for armed criminal action and for the underlying felony.\n\nWe continue to find this argument persuasive.\n\nWe may note that Whalen's application of the Blockburger doctrine as a rule of statutory construction paralleled the application given Blockburger in our effort to resolve the constitutional issue in Sours. Compare Whalen, 445 U.S. at 693, 100 S.Ct. at 1439, with Sours, 593 S.W.2d at 219. In Sours, we stated that if the underlying felony used to prove armed criminal action were a single named felony instead of a class of offenses, \"it would be obvious that armed criminal action includes all of the elements of the felony specified.\" We observed that \"the result is no different where the statute refers to 'any felony.'\" 593 S.W.2d at 219. In Whalen, the Court concluded that \" conviction for killing in the course of a rape cannot be had without proving all the elements of the offense of rape.\" 445 U.S. at 693, 100 S.Ct. at 1439. The Court rejected the government's contention that felony murder and rape were not the same offense under the same evidence testof Blockburger.\n\nThe Government contends that felony murder and rape are not the \"same offense\" under Blockburger, since the former offense does not in all cases require proof of a rape; that is, D.C.Code § 22-2401 proscribes the killing of another person in the course of committing rape or robbery or kidnapping or arson, etc. Where the offense to be proved does not include proof of a rape-for example, where the offense is a killing in the perpetration of a robbery - the offense is of course different from the offense of rape, and the Government is correct in believing that cumulative punishments for the felony murder and for a rape would be permitted under Blockburger, In the present case, however, proof of rape is a necessary element of proof of the felony murder, and we are unpersuaded that this case should be treated differently from other cases in which one criminal offense requires proof of every element of another offense. There would be no question in this regard if Congress, instead of listing the six lesser included offenses in the alternative, had separately proscribed the six different species of felony murder under six statutory provisions. It is doubtful that Congress could have imagined that so formal a difference in drafting had any practical significance, and we ascribe none to it.\n\n445 U.S. at 694, 100 S.Ct. at 1439.\n\nThe application of the same evidence test in Sours is also supported by the United States Supreme Court's holding in Illinois v. Vitale, U.S. , 100 S.Ct. 2260, 65 L.Ed.2d 228 (1980), a multiple prosecution case. In Vitale, respondent, a juvenile was convicted of failing to reduce speed to avoid an accident, a violation of § 11-601(a) of the Illinois Vehicle Code. The charge arose out of an accident in which an automobile driven by respondent struck and fatally wounded two small children. Subsequently, a petition for adjudication of wardship was filed against respondent in the Circuit Court of Cook County, charging Vitale with two counts of involuntary manslaughter. The Illinois Supreme Court upheld the dismissal of the second proceeding on the ground that it was barred by the double jeopardy clause. In re Vitale, 71 Ill.2d 229, 16 Ill.Dec. 456, 375 N.E.2d 87 (1978). The United States Supreme Court vacated the judgment and remanded the case for consideration whether the judgment was based on state or federal grounds. 439 U.S. 974, 99 S.Ct. 554, 58 L.Ed.2d 645 (1978). The Illinois Supreme Court certified that the judgment was based on federal constitutional grounds, and the United States Supreme Court again granted certiorari. 444 U.S. 823, 100 S.Ct. 42, 62 L.Ed.2d 29 (1979). The Court reaffirmed the principle that the double jeopardy clause not only prohibits multiple prosecutions for the same offense but also protects against imposing multiple punishments for the same offense. U.S. at , 100 S.Ct. at 2264. Accord, Brown v. Ohio, 432 U.S. 161, 165, 97 S.Ct. 2221, 2224, 53 L.Ed.2d 168 (1977); North Carolina v. Pearce, 395 U.S. 711, 717, 89 S.Ct. 2072, 2076, 23 L.Ed.2d 656 (1969). The Court in Vitale also reaffirmed its holding in Harris v. Oklahoma, 433 U.S. 682, 97 S.Ct. 2912, 53 L.Ed.2d 1054 (1977):\n\nIn Harris, we held, without Dissent, that a defendant's conviction for felony murder based on a killing in the course of an armed robbery barred a subsequent prosecution against the same defendant for the robbery. The Oklahoma felony murder statute on its face did not require proof of a robbery to establish felony murder; other felonies could underlie a felony - murder prosecution. But for the purposes of the Double Jeopardy Clause, we did not consider the crime generally described as felony murder as a separate offense distinct from its various elements. Rather, we treated a killing in the course of a robbery as itself a separate statutory offense, and the robbery as a species of lesser-included offense. The State conceded that the robbery for which petitioner had been indicted was in fact the underlying felony, all elements of which had been proved in the murder prosecution. We held the subsequent robbery prosecution barred under the Double Jeopardy Clause, since under In re Neilsen, 131 U.S. 176, 9 S.Ct. 672, 33 L.Ed. 118 (1889), a person who has been convicted of a crime having several elements included in it may not subsequently be tried for a lesser-included offense - an offense consisting solely of one or more of the elements of the crime for which he has already been convicted. Under Brown, the reverse is also true; a conviction on a lesser-included offense bars subsequent trial on the greater offense.\n\nU.S. at , 100 S.Ct. at 2267.\n\nDespite the Illinois Supreme Court's assertion in Vitale that \"the lesser offense, failing to reduce speed, requires no proof beyond that which is necessary for conviction of the greater, involuntary manslaughter,\" and its Conclusion that \"the greater offense is by definition the 'same' as the lesser offense included within it,\" 71 Ill.2d at 239, 16 Ill.Dec. at 460, 375 N.E.2d at 91, the United States Supreme Court vacated the judgment and remanded the case for further proceedings \"ecause of our doubts about the relationship under Illinois law between the crimes of manslaughter and a careless failure to reduce speed to avoid an accident, and because the reckless act or acts the State will rely on to prove manslaughter are still unknown.\" U.S. at , 100 S.Ct. at 2267.\n\n[5] We are here forced to address the constitutional issue expressly reserved in Whalen, 445 U.S. at 690, 100 S.Ct. at 1435, 1437; Simpson, 435 U.S. at 11, 98 S.Ct at 912; and Iannelli, 420 U.S. at 785-86 nn. 17-18, 95 S.Ct. 1293-94 nn. 17-18. See Jeffers, 432 U.S. at 155, 97 S.Ct. at 2218. We must conclude, for the reasons set forth in Sours v. State, 593 S.W.2d 208 (Mo. banc 1980), that the proof of the underlying felony-robbery first degree - does not require proof of a fact not also required to prove armed criminal action, or in other words, that proof of armed criminal action necessarily proves every fact required to establish the underlying felony. Consequently, the two offenses are the \"same offense\" for double jeopardy purposes, Vitale, U.S. at , 100 S.Ct. at 2266. Whalen, 445 U.S. at 694, 100 S.Ct. at 1439; Harris, 433 U.S. at 682, 97 S.Ct. at 2912; Brown, 432 U.S. at 167, 97 S.Ct. at 2226, and the double jeopardy clause prohibits the state from punishing appellant for both offenses. We believe that, because the double jeopardy clause prohibits punishing a person twice for the same offense, \"the prosecution may not do in one trial what it is prohibited from doing in two trials.\" Elmore v. State, 382 N.E.2d 893, 894-95 (Ind. 1978). See cases that apply the rationale of Harris v. Oklahoma in the single prosecution context. State v. Morgan, 592 S.W.2d 796, 803 (Mo. banc 1980); State v. Pinder, 375 So.2d 836, 838 (Fla. 1979); Tyson v. State, 386 N.E.2d 1185, 1193 (Ind. 1979); Mitchell v. State, 382 N.E.2d 932, 934 (Ind. 1978); Elmore v. State, 382 N.E.2d 893, 894, 95 (Ind. 1978); State v. Frye, 283 Md. 709, 393 A.2d 1372, 1375 (1978); Briggs v. State, 573 S.W.2d 157, 159 (Tenn. 1978). See also State v. Neal, 514 S.W.2d 544, 548 (Mo. banc 1974); State v. Parsons, 513 S.W.2d 430, 438 (Mo. 1974).\n\nIf the vacation of our prior judgment and the remand of the case for reconsideration in light of Whalen was intended to lead this Court to adopt the view that the General Assembly is free to impose separate punishments for two crimes that constitute the same offense under the traditional same evidence test, we are unable to so read Whalen and we are not prepared to take that step. We believe that the United States Supreme Court has heretofore reserved that question as noted above. We believe that such a ruling would abolish the traditional double jeopardy protection against multiple punishments for the same offense. It would require bifurcation of the meaning of \"same offense\" under the double jeopardy clause. It would grant to the state legislature the power to define the meaning of \"same offense\" as used in the double jeopardy clause of the Constitution, a traditional judicial function. The implicit effect of such a holding would be that the double jeopardy clause would hereafter be only a limitation on the executive and judicial branches, but not on the legislative branch of government. We do not believe that it is appropriate for this Court to make such a ruling. If such a ruling is to be made, it is the responsibility of the United States Supreme Court to make it.\n\nAfter thorough examination of the opinions in Whalen v. United States, 593 S.W.2d 684, 100 S.Ct. 1432, 63 L.Ed.2d 715 (1980), we have concluded that our original opinion and judgment in Sours v. State, 593 S.W.2d 208 (Mo.banc 1980), was correct and should be reinstated as supplemented by our opinion today. We reverse the judgment of the trial court insofar as it denied appellant relief from his conviction for armed criminal action, and vacate and set aside that conviction. We affirm the judgment of the trial court insofar as it denied appellant relief from his conviction for robbery first degree.\n\nBARDGETT, C. J., and SEILER, MORGAN and HIGGINS, JJ., concur.\n\nDONNELLY, J., Dissents in separate Dissenting opinion filed.\n\nRENDLEN, J., Dissents in separate Dissenting opinion filed and concurs in Dissenting opinion of DONNELLY, J.\n\nIn Benton v. Maryland, 395 U.S. 784, 89 S.Ct. 2056, 23 L.Ed.2d 707 (1969), the United States Supreme Court overruled Palko v. Connecticut, 302 U.S. 319, 58 S.Ct. 149, 82 L.Ed. 288 (1937) and applied the Double Jeopardy Clause of the United States Constitution to the states.\n\nIn Sours v. State, 593 S.W.2d 208 (Mo. banc 1980), a majority of this Court ordered a conviction under Missouri's armed criminal action statute set aside because it felt compelled to do so by general declarations of law made in Harris v. Oklahoma, 433 U.S. 682, 97 S.Ct. 2912, 53 L.Ed.2d 1054 (1977).\n\nOn May 27, 1980, in Missouri v. Sours, U.S. , 100 S.Ct. 2935, 64 L.Ed.2d 820, the United States Supreme Court vacated the judgment of this Court in Sours, and remanded the case to this Court \"for further consideration in light of Whalen v. United States, 445 U.S. 684, 100 S.Ct. 1432, 63 L.Ed.2d 715 (1980).\"\n\nOf course, the mandate of May 27, 1980, is the law of the case and is binding on this Court.\n\nIn North Carolina v. Pearce, 395 U.S. 711, 717, 89 S.Ct. 2072, 2076, 23 L.Ed.2d 656 (1969), the United States Supreme Court stated \"that the Fifth Amendment guarantee against double jeopardy * * * has been said to consist of three separate constitutional protections. It protects against a second prosecution for the same offense after acquittal. It protects against a second prosecution for the same offense after conviction. And it protects against multiple punishments for the same offense. * * *.\"\n\nI agree with the Conclusion of the principal opinion that the Missouri General Assembly intended that two separate punishments be imposed for first degree robbery and armed criminal action. I do not agree that the holdings in Harris and Vitale, both second prosecution cases, are pertinent to this multiple punishments case. See State v. Neal, 514 S.W.2d 544, 550, 551 (Mo. banc 1974) (Donnelly, C.J., Concurring). See also Rules 23.05 and 24.07.\n\nThe essential question is: should this Court apply the holdings of Harris and Vitale, both second prosecution cases, in this multiple punishments case when we know that the United States Supreme Court declined the opportunity to apply the Harris holding in Simpson v. United States, 435 U.S. 6, 12, 98 S.Ct. 909, 913, 55 L.Ed.2d 70 (1978), also a multiple punishments case? I think not. In Oregon v. Hass, 420 U.S. 714, 719, 95 S.Ct. 1215, 1219, 43 L.Ed.2d 570 (1975), the Court stated that \"a State may not impose * * * greater restrictions as a matter of federal constitutional law when this Court specifically refrains from imposing them.\" See also North Carolina v. Butler, 441 U.S. 369, 376, 99 S.Ct. 1755, 1759, 60 L.Ed.2d 286 (1979).\n\nIn my view, the logic of Whalen is that the multiple punishments proscription of Pearce is satisfied if the multiple punishments in this case were intended and authorized by the General Assembly - to hold otherwise is to make the mandate of May 27, 1980, inscrutable.\n\nI respectfully Dissent.\n\nRENDLEN, Judge, Dissenting.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nI respectfully Dissent. The majority's mechanical treatment of Blockburger v. United States, 284 U.S. 299, 52 S.Ct. 180, 76 L.Ed. 306 (1932), \"same offense\" test as substantive double jeopardy doctrine is in my view a misapplication of that test and an exaltation of form over substance. The principal opinion decides the double jeopardy clause forbids conviction and punishment in a single prosecution for armed criminal action and robbery under Blockburger. The majority does so against a tapestry of dicta woven largely from successive prosecution cases and by skillful conversion of the canon for \"statutory construction\" prescribed by Blockburger, into a rigid doctrine of constitutional right. The Supreme Court's mandate that on reconsideration we be guided by Whalen v. United States, 445 U.S. 684, 100 S.Ct. 1432, 63 L.Ed.2d 715 (1980), neither so requires nor permits. In this regard the present effort is little more than a recasting of our original opinion vacated by the Court.\n\nWilliam Scott Sours was charged with robbery first degree by means of a dangerous and deadly weapon ( § 560.120, RSMo 1969 and § 560.135, RSMo Supp. 1975) and armed criminal action ( § 559.225, RSMo Supp.1976) for participating in an armed robbery of a Mr. Quick Store in Jasper County. On October 5, 1977, Sours pled guilty to both charges and on January 5, 1978, was sentenced to five years imprisonment on the robbery conviction and three years imprisonment on the armed criminal action conviction, the sentences to run consecutively. See Sours v. State, 593 S.W.2d 208, 209-210 (Mo. banc 1980) (vacated --U.S. --, 100 S.Ct. 2935, 64 L.Ed.2d 820 (1980)).\n\nIt should be noted at the outset that the majority fails to address the important question of whether Sours' guilty plea constituted \"a break in the chain of events\" so as to preclude litigation of the double jeopardy issue in this post-conviction Rule 27.26 proceeding. See Tollett v. Henderson 411 U.S. 258, 267, 93 S.Ct. 1602, 1608, 36 L.Ed.2d 235 (1973); Francis v. Henderson, 425 U.S. 536, 542-542, 96 S.Ct. 1708, 1711, 48 L.Ed.2d 149 (1976); Wainwright v. Sykes, 433 U.S. 72, 86-87, 97 S.Ct. 2497, 2506, 53 L.Ed.2d 594 (1977). Cf. Jeffers v. United States, 432 U.S. 137, 152, 97 S.Ct. 2207, 2216, 53 L.Ed.2d 168 (1977). Recently in Weir v. State, 589 S.W.2d 256 (Mo. banc 1979), this Court questioned the cognizability of a claim of double jeopardy in a Rule 27.26 proceeding following defendant's failure to raise the objection at the trial level. The majority fails to consider the rule announced by Weir, at 258:\n\nt is now settled by numerous decisions in both the federal and state systems that where there is a deliberate bypass, whether for strategic, tactical, or other reasons, of orderly state procedure, a movant is precluded from raising a constitutional issue on a post conviction motion. Instead of eagerly seizing the constitutional issue, we should remand for a determination by the sentencing court whether Sours by pleading guilty has deliberately bypassed orderly state procedures1b and only after a determination that he has not, should we address the far reaching federal constitutional question.\n\nTurning to the constitutional issue, it was the framers' intent2b that the Fifth Amendment embody the common law's double jeopardy protection against a defendant's reprosecution following conviction or acquittal upon a criminal charge.3b See Brown v. Ohio, 432 U.S. 161, 165, 97 S.Ct. 2221, 2225, 53 L.Ed2d 187 (1977); United States v. Wilson, 420 U.S. 332, 340-342, 95 S.Ct. 1013, 1020-1021, 43 L.Ed.2d 232 (1975). James Madison tendered the original draft of the Fifth Amendment,4b later amended to its present form, midst concern that a defendant's right to new trial not be abridged by a conviction erroneously obtained. See Wilson, id. citing I Annals of Congress 753 (1789). At the time of adoption the limited number of common law felonies, e. g., rape, robbery, murder, arson and burglary allowed for ready application and more certain protection for criminal defendants under the double jeopardy clause. Today, given the proliferation of complex statutory crimes, it is recognized that the doctrine's original scope cannot provide complete and certain answers in many cases. Nevertheless in the constitutional construction process, we are guided by the purposes and policies underlying the constitutional protections afforded by the framers and those who ratified our Bill of Rights.\n\nThe fountainhead of that aspect of double jeopardy jurisprudence described as the double punishment doctrine appears to be Ex parte Lange, 85 U.S. (18 Wall.) 163, 21 L.Ed. 872 (1873). There the sentencing court exceeded the legislative authorization for punishment of a statutory crime. Defendant was convicted of stealing post office property for which the statutes provided as punishment, imprisonment for not more than one year or a fine of $10 to $200. The court however sentenced Lange to one year's imprisonment and a fine of $200. It was in that context of the trial court having exceeded its statutory authority that the double punishment doctrine had its origins. On review, the Court was concerned with the trial court having exceeded the legislative authorization not the legislature's constitutional authority to proscribe certain acts as crimes and prescribe punishment therefore. The Court at 176 stated:\n\nWe are of opinion that when the prisoner, as in this case, by reason of a valid judgment, had fully suffered one of the alternative punishments to which alone the law subjected him, the power of the court to punish further was gone. That the principle we have discussed then interposed its shield, and forbid that he should be punished again for that offense. (Emphasis added.) Whalen v. United States, 445 U.S. 684, 100 S.Ct. 1432, 63 L.Ed.2d 715 (1980), which guides us here, emphasized that the decision in terms of \"double punishment\" turns on the legislative intent, stating that \"the dispositive question, therefore, is whether Congress did so provide.\" 445 U.S. at 688, 100 S.Ct. 1432 at 1436, 63 L.Ed.2d at 722.\n\nThe double punishment doctrine does not constitute a substantive limitation on the legislature's power to define and punish crimes. See Whalen v. United States, 445 U.S. 695-696, 100 S.Ct. 1432, 1440, 63 L.Ed.2d 715, 725 (1980) (concurring opinion of White, J.); 445 U.S. 696-699, 100 S.Ct. 1432, 1440, 63 L.Ed.2d 715, 726 (concurring opinion of Blackmun, J.) Westen and Drubel, Towards A General Theory of Double Jeopardy, Sup.Ct.Rev. 81, 112-115 (1978). See also Note \"Twice in Jeopardy\" 75 Yale L.J. 262, 311-313 (1965). The Court in Whalen addressed the multiple punishment issue in terms of whether the judicial action had exceeded the legislative authorization. After a Discussion of Lange, which as noted above can best be described as a legislative authorization case, the Court held, \"he Double Jeopardy Clause at the very least precludes federal courts from imposing consecutive sentences unless authorized by Congress to do so. The Fifth Amendment guarantee against double jeopardy embodies in this respect simply one aspect of the basic principal that within our federal constitutional framework the legislative power, including the power to define criminal offenses and to prescribe the punishments to be imposed upon those found guilty of them, resides wholly with the Congress.\" Whalen, 445 U.S. 684, 689, 100 S.Ct. 1432, 1436, 63 L.Ed.2d 715, 722 (1980).\n\nThe reason for this Conclusion seems self apparent. To say that the legislature can punish crime X by life imprisonment but that it cannot define certain acts as crime X1c punishable by five years to life and crime X2c punishable by three years to life respectively, employs an intellectual artifice providing the criminal defendant little or no additional protection. The majority holds that under the then applicable statutes a defendant could be convicted of armed robbery punishable by five years to life or of armed criminal action and sentenced to three years to life,5a but could not be convicted of both in the same proceeding and if so convicted the armed criminal action conviction must be vacated. (One might ask, why the armed criminal action conviction?) The principal opinion skirts the Double Jeopardy Clause's historical purpose to protect the defendant from harassment, relitigation, and judicial usurpation of the legislative authority to punish. See Note, Twice in Jeopardy, 75 Yale L.J. 262, 266-267 (1965). Instead the majority seeks to transform the provision protecting against double punishment into a diluted analogue of the Eighth Amendment without measurably enhancing the defendant's protections as shown above.6a Though the Eighth Amendment remains a vital and essential safeguard against excessive punishment by the legislature (see Coker v. Georgia, 433 U.S. 584, 592, 97 S.Ct. 2861, 2866, 53 L.Ed.2d 982 (1977); State v. Higgins, 592 S.W.2d 151 (Mo. banc 1979), appeal dismissed 446 U.S. 902, 100 S.Ct. 1825, 64 L.Ed.2d 254 (1980), redesigning the Fifth Amendment to serve the purpose filled by the Eighth serves no legitimate function7a and violates the canons of orderly constitutional construction.\n\nThe only apparent justification for the majority's manipulation of the double punishment doctrine is to guard against prosecutorial and judicial arbitrariness. A constitutional issue of some dimension would be presented if the statutory pattern allowed random and capricious results in which some defendants were convicted of one of the constituent crimes and others convicted of both without any ascertainable justification. Such is not the case under our statutes. The legislature, as recognized by the majority, clearly intended that a person committing a felony with a firearm be convicted and punished for both the underlying felony and armed criminal action. \"Any person who commits any felony under the laws of this State by, with, or through the use, assistance, or aid of a dangerous or deadly weapon is also guilty of the crime of armed criminal action. . .. The punishment imposed pursuant to this subsection shall be in addition to any punishment provided by law for the crime committed by, with, or through the use, assistance, or aid of a dangerous or deadly weapon.\" Section 559.225, RSMo Supp.1976. The uncertainty as to legislative intent in Whalen is not present here. Further, it was noted there that \"he Double Jeopardy Clause at the very least precludes federal courts from imposing consecutive sentences unless authorized by Congress to do so.\" Whalen, 445 U.S. 684, 689, 100 S.Ct. 1432, 1436, 63 L.Ed.2d 715, 722 (1980). The penalties imposed here were explicitly provided by the legislature. The problem of ambiguity for which the rule of lenity provides an important safeguard against prosecutorial and judicial arbitrariness, simply is not present. In sum, when the legislative intent that an act be punished as two crimes is clear, the potential for arbitrariness by prosecutors and Judges is de minimus. As a result, no issue of constitutional dimension arises under the Fifth Amendment by the operation of our Missouri armed criminal action statute.\n\nAn examination of earlier United States Supreme Court opinions and recent summary actions by that Court points up the validity of our Missouri armed criminal action scheme under which a person who commits a felony with a dangerous and deadly weapon may be found guilty of two offenses, armed criminal action and the underlying felony. In Jeffers v. United States, 432 U.S. 137, 147-150, 97 S.Ct. 2207, 2214-15, 53 L.Ed.2d 168 (1977), the Court assumed arguendo, that 18 U.S.C. 846 (conspiracy to distribute heroin) was a lesser included offense of 18 U.S.C. 848 (conducting an enterprise to distribute heroin), and held that a defendant convicted of 846 in a prior proceeding had no double jeopardy claim in respect to a later 848 prosecution because the defendant had earlier successfully moved to sever the charges. A fortiori, it may be said that Jeffers, who was tried and convicted in two proceedings for two offenses, one of which the Court assumed to be a lesser included offense, could have been tried for both in a single proceeding and so it is with Sours.\n\nThe majority's reliance on Harris v. Oklahoma, 433 U.S. 682, 97 S.Ct. 2912, 53 L.Ed.2d 1054 (1977) and Brown v. Ohio, 432 U.S. 161, 97 S.Ct. 2221, 53 L.Ed.2d 187 (1977), is misplaced. First, Harris and Brown were successive prosecution cases involving the serious risks of vexation and harassment to criminal defendants attendant in multiple prosecutions. Further, the precise issue presented here was specifically reserved by the Court in Simpson v. United States, 435 U.S. 6, 11-12, 98 S.Ct. 909, 912-913, 55 L.Ed.2d 70 (1978), decided some eight months following Harris, which teaches that Harris was not, as asserted by the majority, dispositive of the issue here. I might add that the mandate of the Court in Sours does not direct us to decide this case \"in the light of Harris v. Oklahoma.\" Harris merely held that a defendant's conviction of felony murder based on a killing in the course of an armed robbery barred a subsequent prosecution against that same defendant for robbery. Harris v. Oklahoma, 433 U.S. 682, 97 S.Ct. 2912, 53 L.Ed.2d 1054 (1977). Brown decided only that once a defendant was convicted of misdemeanor joyriding, the State was barred by double jeopardy from convicting the defendant of the greater included offense of felony auto theft in a subsequent prosecution. \"he Fifth Amendment forbids successive prosecution and cumulative punishment for a greater and lesser included offense,\" (Emphasis added), Brown v. Ohio, 432 U.S. 161 at 169, 97 S.Ct. at 2227 (1977). Indeed the Court in Brown reiterated 432 U.S. at 165, 97 S.Ct. at 2225 the freedom of the legislature to proscribe criminal conduct and prescribe punishment.\n\nhe Fifth Amendment double jeopardy guarantee serves principally as a restraint on courts and prosecutors. The legislature remains free under the Double Jeopardy Clause to define crimes and fix punishments; but once the legislature has acted courts may not impose more than one punishment for the same offense and prosecutors ordinarily may not attempt to secure that punishment in more than one trial. Brown v. Ohio, 432 U.S. 161, 165, 97 S.Ct. 2221, 2225.\n\nNot only does the majority disregard the Court's consistent concern in decisions from Lange to Whalen with the scope of legislative authorization as to double punishment claims, it also fails to recognize that the defendant's interest in finality, the core value furthered by the Double Jeopardy Clause, is not implicated in unitary prosecution cases. The prime consideration in this unitary prosecution case is the legislative objective of deterring violent offenders by increasing penalties for felonies committed with a weapon.8a The principal opinion effectively thwarts that objective.\n\nThe majority fails to discuss the recent action of the Court on a nearly identical issue dismissing an appeal for want of a substantial federal question. The Court dismissed the appeal from a Michigan Supreme Court decision holding that consecutive punishment does not violate the federal constitution's Fifth Amendment. Wayne County Prosecutor v. Recorder's Court Judge and People v. Brintley, 406 Mich. 374, 280 N.W.2d 793 (Mich.1979) appeal dismissed sub nom. Brintley v. Michigan, 444 U.S. 948, 100 S.Ct. 418, 62 L.Ed.2d 317 (1979). There, the Michigan Supreme Court addressed the constitutionality of convictions under a Michigan statute (similar to the Missouri armed criminal action statute) providing that a felony committed by a person with a firearm constituted an additional offense, for which one convicted was to be punished consecutively to the sentence imposed on the underlying felony. Defendant contended his convictions violated rights protected by the Fifth Amendment. See MCLA 750.227b(b);9a Id. at 794. The Michigan Court, in a persuasive and comprehensive opinion dealing with the precise question here presented, held that by enacting the felony-firearm statute the legislature created a separate crime distinct from the underlying felony and intended that consecutive punishments be imposed. Brintley, 280 N.W.2d 793 at 795-796. In one of the cases involved in that consolidated appeal, People v. Brintley, the court firmly concluded that conviction of both felony firearm and armed robbery offenses (described as the \"same offense\" under the majority opinion here) was not violative of the federal constitution's protection against double jeopardy. Id. at 799-800. Of prime importance here, the United States Supreme Court dismissed the appeal from that judgment \"for want of substantial federal question.\" 444 U.S. 948, 100 S.Ct. 418, 62 L.Ed.2d 317. The Court's refusal to disturb the Conclusion of the Michigan Supreme Court that conviction of both felony-firearm and armed robbery in a single proceeding did not violate the Fifth Amendment's prescription has precedential value as a Disposition on the merits. See Hicks v. Miranda, 422 U.S. 332, 344-345, 95 S.Ct. 2281, 2289, 45 L.Ed.2d 223 (1975). We are bound to follow that summary decision under the command of the Supremacy Clause as to all federal questions. Art. VI, § 2, United States Constitution. As recently explained by the United States Supreme Court, \"ummary affirmances and dismissals for want of a substantial federal question without doubt reject the specific challenges presented in the statement of jurisdiction and do leave undisturbed the judgment appealed from. They do prevent lower courts from coming to opposite Conclusions on the precise issues presented and necessarily decided by those actions.\" Mandel v. Bradley, 432 U.S. 173 at 176, 97 S.Ct. 2238 at 2240 (1977). Here the majority has reached a decision diametrically opposed to the Conclusion reached in Brintley and seems unconcerned that the appeal was dismissed by the Supreme Court for want of a substantial federal question. In the jurisdictional statement to the appeal filed by Brintley, a claim was made that conviction of both felony-firearm and armed robbery violated the double jeopardy doctrine.10a The Supreme Court necessarily rejected that claim when it dismissed the appeal. Yet the majority ignores or overlooks Brintley and decides the same issue on federal constitutional grounds. While such action is defensible in the context of adjudication of state constitutional provisions, it does not square with the command of the Supremacy Clause and the role of state courts in the federal systems when federal questions are presented.\n\nNeither do subsequent doctrinal developments justify the majority's disregard of the Court's summary action in Brintley. As previously noted in Whalen, the Court's most recent pronouncement, the constitutional issue was discussed in terms of whether the punishment imposed exceeds the legislative authorization. Having determined Congress did not intend consecutive punishments by enacting D.C.Code 23-112, the Court stated, \"Congress is clearly free to fashion exceptions to the rule it chose to enact in § 23 112.\" Whalen, 445 U.S. 684, 695, 100 S.Ct. 1432, 1439, 63 L.Ed.2d 715, 725 (1980). We might add, if the Congress has such latitude, why not the Missouri General Assembly?\n\nI conclude the majority opinion confers upon courts a role neither contemplated by those who ratified the Fifth Amendment nor supported by subsequent Supreme Court decisions interpreting it. As Justice Frankfurter analyzed a similar claim, \"In effect, we are asked to enter the domain of penology, and more particularly that tantalizing aspect of it, the proper apportionment of punishment. Whatever views may be entertained regarding severity of punishment, whether one believes in its efficacy or its futility, these are peculiarly questions of legislative policy.\" Citations omitted. Gore v. United States, 357 U.S. 386 at 393, 78 S.Ct. 1280 at 1285, 2 L.Ed.2d 564 (1958). I submit the majority opinion in the name of double punishment doctrine invades the power of the legislature to define crimes and prescribe punishment. Accordingly, I must Dissent.\n\nFrank Conley, J., of robbery in first degree, and defendant appealed. The Court of Appeals, Shangler, J., held that: (1) evidence, including showing that alleged colloquy between defendant and companion in which defendant \"discussed the matter with about making false statements to get her cut loose\" could only have occurred by shouts through jail since defendant was held on first floor and companion was held on second floor, was sufficient to establish that defendant's confession was not improperly coerced by exploitation of desire to protect person held in close affection from rigor of prison; (2) denial of crime did not constitute implicit election of right to remain silent where defendant made officers fully aware that he knew Miranda rights by heart; (3) confession was not improper exploitation of illegal arrest where evidence showed no purposefulness of arrest by Iowa officers other than for Iowa burglary, and Missouri officers, to whom defendant confessed as to Missouri crimes, were unaware that the arrest was made without warrant or probable cause; and (4) there was no error in refusing tender by defendant of submission on stealing.\n\nAffirmed.\n\nI join the majority in its affirmance of defendant's conviction (sentence 15 years) for robbery in the first degree on Count I. However, I cannot concur in the reversal of the armed criminal action conviction, under Court II (sentence 15 years) because that reversal stems from the majority's adamant refusal to follow the controlling law, most recently announced by the United States Supreme Court in Albernaz v. United States, 450 U.S. 332, 49 U.S.L.W. 4237 (March 9, 1981). The case at bar is but another of those in which Missouri juries have, in single trials on separate counts convicted defendants of robberies (or other statutory crimes), and on armed criminal action charges under § 559.225, RSMo Supp. 1976 (now § 571.015, RSMo 1978).\n\nThis court mistakenly holds the double jeopardy proscription of the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution requires reversal of the armed criminal action convictions in those cases. The majority launched this course in Sours v. State, 593 S.W.2d 208 (Mo. banc January 15, 1980) (Sours I), and anchored its position in Sours v. State, 603 S.W.2d 592 (Mo. banc August 8, 1980) (Sours II). The three districts of our Court of Appeals, have been confronted by a surprisingly large number of such cases, and bound by this court's \"Sours\" decision, have reversed the armed criminal action convictions. As noted in the margin below, \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e1\u003c/span\u003e between March 23 and June 22 of this year, the United States Supreme Court vacated judgments of reversal in 16 such cases, and in each instance remanded the cause \"for further consideration in light of Albernaz v. United States, 450 U.S. (1981).\" In addition, the Court accepted for review three of our cases \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e2\u003c/span\u003e in which armed criminal action convictions were set aside under the \"Sours\" notion of double jeopardy, and on May 26, 1981, directed they too be reconsidered in the light of Albernaz. The referenced cases remanded to our appellate courts were subsequently transferred here at our order, and though the mandates are directed to the respective appellate courts, they become the sine qua non to our actions thereon, as well as in the cases here on direct remand.\n\nHaggard, the cause now before us on original appeal, assumes the stance on the substantive issue as those in which our judgments have been vacated and hence, requires our application of the law under Albernaz. The essence of Albernaz, quite simply, is that the Legislature may authorize multiple punishments, and if so, imposition of such sentences is not violative of the double jeopardy provisions of the federal Constitution. The question is one of legislative intent, and because the majority concedes the Missouri Legislature intended to impose punishment for both crimes here involved, i.e., robbery and armed criminal action, the analysis should end and convictions on both counts be affirmed. However, the majority refuses to accept the clearly stated directive of the United States Supreme Court.\n\nOur Legislature has provided for multiple punishment upon conviction of armed criminal action under § 559.225, RSMo Supp. 1976, and robbery in the first degree with a dangerous and deadly weapon, §§ 560.120, RSMo 1969, and 560.135, RSMo Supp. 1975, though commission of these crimes occur in the same transaction. In so doing, the Legislature has meticulously defined the crimes and prescribed the punishments, making clear its intent (as conceded by the majority) to convict and punish, within prescribed ranges, for each act. However, on January 15, 1980, in Sours I, a majority of this court, overturning our earlier decision in State v. Treadway, 558 S.W.2d 646 (Mo. banc 1977), cert. denied, 439 U.S. 838 (1978), and, invoking federal double jeopardy doctrine, declared impermissible the convictions for robbery and armed criminal action obtain in a single trial. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e3\u003c/span\u003e\n\nWhile Sours I was under consideration for review on certiorari, the Supreme Court decided Whalen v. United States, 445 U.S. 684 (1980), and addressing the \"double punishment\" issue, emphasized that \"he dispositive question, therefore, is whether Congress did so provide\", id. at 689; i.e., did the Legislature intend to prescribe multiple punishment for the crimes charged; if so, the convictions may stand. As discussed in my Dissent in Sours II :\n\nThe double punishment doctrine does not constitute a substantive limitation on the legislature's power to define and punish crimes. See Whalen v. United States, 445 U.S. 695-696, 100 S.Ct. 1432, 1440, 63 L.Ed.2d 715, 726 (1980) (concurring opinion of White, J.); 445 U.S. 696-699, 100 S.Ct. 1432, 1440, 63 L.Ed.2d 715, 726 (concurring opinion of Blackmun, J.) Westen and Drubel, Towards A General Theory of Double Jeopardy, Sup. Ct. Rev. 81, 112-115 (1978). See also Note \"Twice in Jeopardy\" 75 Yale L. J. 262, 311-313 (1965). The Court in Whalen addressed the multiple punishment issue in terms of whether the judicial action had exceeded the legislative authorization. After a Discussion of Lange, which as noted above can best be described as a legislative authorization case, the Court held, 'he Double Jeopardy Clause at the very least precludes federal courts from imposing consecutive sentences unless authorized by Congress to do so. The Fifth Amendment guarantee against double jeopardy embodies in this respect simply one aspect of the basic principal that within our federal constitutional framework the legislative power, including the power to define criminal offenses and to prescribe the punishments to be imposed upon those found guilty of them, resides wholly with the Congress.' Whalen, 445 U.S. 684, 689, 100 S.Ct. 1432, 1436, 63 L.Ed.2d 715, 722 (1980). Sours v. State, 603 S.W.2d 592, 607 at 609 (Mo. banc 1980).\n\nShrugging off the teaching of Whalen and the Court's mandate that our case be reconsidered in light of that decision, the majority, on August 18, 1980, in Sours II, reiterated its position, declaring that although the Missouri Legislature intended punishment for both crimes, it could not constitutionally so authorize, and convictions under both statutes constituted double jeopardy. Dissatisfied with this expression of indifference toward the holding of Whalen, the State again petitioned for certiorari, and during pendency of that proceeding, William Scott Sours was, on September 25, 1980, released from the Missouri State Penitentiary. This fact was relayed to the Court by brief of Sours' counsel \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e4\u003c/span\u003e opposing issuance of the writ, and on January 26, 1981, the petition for certiorari in Missouri v. Sours (from Sours II) was denied, with the statement that \"Justice Blackmun and Justice Rehnquist would dismiss the petition for a writ of certiorari as moot.\" Missouri v. Sours, U.S. , 101 S.Ct. 953, 67 L.Ed.2d 118 (1981).\n\nLess than two months later, on March 9, Justice Rehnquist delivering the opinion, the Court decided Albernaz v. United States, 450 U.S. 332, 49 U.S.L.W. 4237 (1981), affirming the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit which had upheld petitioner's convictions and sentences and denied his claim of double jeopardy. The Court, by way of introduction to its incisive pellucid opinion, noted:\n\nWe granted certiorari to consider whether Congress intended consecutive sentences to be imposed for the violation of these two conspiracy statutes and, if so, whether such cumulative punishment violates the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment of the United States Constitution. 450 U.S. at ; 49 U.S.L.W. at 4238. By its decision the Court, in its concluding paragraphs, removed any question as to its views on the matter, stating:\n\nThus, the question of what punishments are constitutionally permissible is not different from the question of what punishment the Legislative Branch intended to be imposed. Where Congress intended, as it did here, to impose multiple punishment, imposition of such sentences does not violate the Constitution. 450 U.S. at ; 49 U.S.L.W. at 4240.\n\nImmediately after this pronouncement, the Court commenced a succession of orders to Missouri's appellate courts beginning March 23rd, vacating judgments which had reversed armed criminal action convictions when accompanied with convictions of other crimes, and mandating further consideration in the light of Albernaz.\n\nOn May 12, 1981, the Supreme Court of Delaware, acting responsibly, followed the mandate of the Court under Albernaz in a case involving imposition of multiple sentences for (1) first-degree assault, 11 Del.C. § 613(1), and (2) possession of a deadly weapon during the commission of a felony, 11 Del.C. § 1447. Hunter v. State, A.2d (Del. 1981) (No. 215, 1978, decided May 12, 1981) (Hunter III). The Delaware court had vacated the multiple sentences in Hunter v. State, 420 A.2d 119 (Del. 1980) (No. 215, 1978, decided March 14, 1980) (Hunter I), and had reaffirmed its position in light of Whalen, upon motion for reargument and clarification, in Hunter v. State, 420 A.2d 119, 127 (Del. 1980) (No. 215, 1978, decided June 24, 1980) (Hunter II). As in the similar Missouri cases, the United States Supreme Court granted certiorari, vacated the judgment and ordered the Delaware court to reconsider in the light of Albernaz. Delaware v. Hunter, 450 U.S. , 101 S.Ct. 1689, 68 L.Ed.2d 190 (1981). On May 12, 1981, the Delaware court responded with Hunter III, recognizing the clear import of Albernaz which it described as\n\nthe emergence of the evolving rule stands unmistakably clear by virtue of the vote of 6 to 3, cast in the face of the flat contradiction of the Concurring Justices, including the author of Whalen.\n\nApplying the rule of Albernaz to the instant case, we now hold that where the General Assembly intended, as we have found that it did in § 613(1) and § 1447, to impose multiple punishments for two offenses not satisfying the Blockburger test, imposition of two consecutive sentences by a court as a result of a single criminal trial does not violate the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment. (Footnote omitted). A.2d at . In sum, the Delaware court, recognizing \"the rule of supremacy\", correctly read and properly followed the \"evolving rule\" enunciated by the Court in Albernaz. It strains credulity how the majority here can do otherwise.\n\nIt serves little purpose to casually dismiss Albernaz as the majority has done with its unjustified characterization of the Delaware court's so-called \"frustration\". Under the Rule of Federal Supremacy, we are not permitted such cavalier evasion of the principles of Whalen and the mandate of Albernaz.\n\nIn a manner reminiscent of Quixana's Don Quixote de la Mancha's search for giants that became a comic tilt with windmills, the majority vainly seeks authority to justify its action by suggesting that the denial of certiorari in Sours II somehow condones its reversal of the armed criminal action conviction in contravention of the mandate or Albernaz. This language appears in the majority opinion:\n\nOn January 26, 1981, the United States Supreme Court entered its order denying the petition of the state for certiorari in Sours II. Following the same reasoning expressed by the Hunter court, a large majority of the Court tacitly, if not in fact, sustained our position as stated in Sours II. Only Justices Blackmun and Rehnquist noted that they 'would dismiss the petition for a writ of certiorari as moot.' U.S. at , 101 S.Ct. at 953, 67 L.Ed.2d at 118. (Emphasis added).\n\nI submit it is pure conjecture to state that denial of certiorari in Sours II constitutes a manifestation of \"the same reasoning expressed by the Hunter court,\" or that \"a large majority of the Court tacitly, if not in fact, sustained our position as stated in Sours II.\" If the Court had intended the denial of certiorari attain the level of authority set by the majority here, it would not have vacated the judgments rendered in 16 of our Court of Appeals' decisions and in 3 of this court's decisions all bottomed on Sours, and in each instance, mandated reconsideration in the light of Albernaz. The Court did not order us to re-examine these cases \"in light of its denial of the petition for certiorari in Sours II \", and yet, such is the attenuated position of the majority. Indeed, if the significance of denial of certiorari in Sours were as the majority describes, the 19 referenced judgments vacated and remanded to Missouri courts would not have been reviewed; instead, those petitions too would have been summarily denied.\n\nFurther, the majority ignores the long established rule that denial of review on certiorari neither imports a decision on the merits of the opinion below, nor forecloses subsequent consideration of the issues determined therein. United States v. Kras, 409 U.S. 434, 443 (1973); Hughes Tool Co. v. Trans World Airlines, Inc., 409 U.S. 363, 365 n. 1 (1973); United States v. Barnett, 376 U.S. 681, 689 n.5 (1964). As stated in Agoston v. Pennsylvania 340 U.S. 844 (1950), \"denial of the petition seeking to bring here [on certiorari] the decision of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania carries with it no support of the decision in that case, nor of any of the views in the opinion supporting it.\" Id. at 845. Hence, the majority's reliance on the denial of the petition for certiorari, for the proposition that the United States Supreme Court gave its blessing to this court's constitutional interpretation in Sours I and II, seems quite unjustified.\n\nFinally, we have reached the point where this court must honor the \"rule of supremacy\" and gracefully accept the Supreme Court's interpretation of the organic law embodied in the Constitution of the United States. By refusing so to do, the majority would burden our Legislature with its view of so-called federal constitutional restraints contrary to those enunciated by the United States Supreme Court under the federal Constitution. In Oregon v. Hass, 420 U.S. 714 (1975), the Court stated, \"a State may not impose such greater restrictions as a matter of federal constitutional law when this Court specifically refrains from imposing them.\" [emphasis in original] Id. at 719. The Oregon court's belief that it could \"interpret the Fourth Amendment more restrictively than interpreted by the United States Supreme Court\" was held \"unsupported by any cited authority, is not the law and surely must be an inadvertent error; in any event, we reject it.\" Id. at 719, n. 4. This rule of supremacy was again asserted in North Carolina v. Butler, 441 U.S. 369 (1979), where, in discussing a criminal accused's rights to counsel and to remain silent, the Court held that by creating an inflexible rule that no implicit waiver by the accused of such rights could ever suffice, the North Carolina Supreme Court had \"gone beyond the requirements of federal organic law. It follows that its judgment cannot stand, since a state court can neither add to nor subtract from the mandates of the United States Constitution.\" Id. at 376. We too are required to abide the Court's interpretation of the United States Constitution, and may not burden our Legislature with federal constitutional notions contrary to the Court's mandate. Our duty is clear, yet the majority has avoided it, stating:\n\nUntil such time as the Supreme Court of the United States declares clearly and unequivocally that the double jeopardy provision of the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution does not apply to the legislative branch of government, we cannot ... enforce multiple punishments for same offense arising out of a single transaction. Neither the Oregon court in Hass nor the North Carolina court in Butler were permitted to journey such an imperious path of nonconformance.\n\nFor these reasons, I Dissent from that portion of the majority opinion reversing defendant's conviction for armed criminal action.\n\nALBERT L.

We hold only that, once the definition of a crime is fixed as a configuration of such elements, the state may not, consistently with the due process clause and the double jeopardy clause, impose separate punishments both for the neutron and for the atom of which it is a part.\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003e4.

Fixing punishment for crimes defined by statute is the province of the legislature, not the courts. State v. Alexander, 315 Mo. 199, 285 S.W. 984, 985 (1926); State v. Higgins, 592 S.W.2d 151 (Mo. banc 1979), appeal dismissed, 446 U.S. 902, 100 S.Ct. 1825, 64 L.Ed.2d 254 (1980).\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003e9a MCLA 750.227b provides:\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003e(1) A person who carries or has in his possession a firearm at the time he commits or attempts to commit a felony, except the violation of section 227 or section 227a, is guilty of a felony, and shall be imprisoned for 2 years.

Michigan, No. 79 5506, appeal dismissed, 444 U.S. 948, 100 S.Ct 418, 62 L.Ed.2d 317 (1980), Brintley's counsel argued that conviction and consecutive punishment in one proceeding for armed robbery and felony firearm under MCLA 750.227b constituted double jeopardy as multiple punishment. The argument headings contained in the statement of jurisdiction spell out this claim. \"I. THE DOUBLE JEOPARDY CLAUSE IS A SUBSTANTIVE LIMITATION ON THE MICHIGAN LEGISLATURE.\" Appellant's Statement of Jurisdiction, page 8. \"II. THE VIOLATION OF § 750.337n ALLEGED IN COUNT II OF EACH INFORMATION REQUIRED PROOF OF ALL ELEMENTS CONTAINED IN COUN , AND THUS THE OFFENSES WERE THE SAME FOR DOUBLE JEOPARDY PURPOSES.\" Appellant's Statement of Jurisdiction, page 11. \"III. CONVICTION UNDER § 750.227b REQUIRES PROOF OF A SPECIFIC FELONY.\" Appellant's Statement of Jurisdiction, page 12. \"IV. MR. BRINTLEY'S SENTENCE HAS BEEN TWICE AUGMENTED UNDER TWO STATUTES WHICH ARE THE SAME FOR DOUBLE JEOPARDY PURPOSES.\" Appellant's Statement of Jurisdiction, page 15. \"V. THE DOUBLE JEOPARDY CLAUSE BARS MULTIPLE CONVICTIONS ARISING FROM A SINGLE ACT OCCURRING AT ONE PLACE, AT ONE TIME, AND FOR ONE PURPOSE.\" Appellant's Statement of Jurisdiction, page 16. The Supreme Court necessarily rejected all these contentions in respect to MCLA 750.227b virtually identical in its consecutive punishment scheme to § 559.225, RSMo Supp.1976. Such rejection is of precedential value in this case and we are bound to follow it. Hicks v. Miranda, 422 U.S. 332, 344, 345, 95 S.Ct. 2281, 2289, 2290, 45 L.Ed.2d 223 (1975).\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003e1 To the Court of Appeals, Eastern District, the United States Supreme Court, in Missouri v.

United States, 450 U.S. (1981),\" the following decisions rendered by that district: (1) State v. White, 610 S.W.2d 646 (Mo. App. 1980), affirming conviction of first degree robbery, but reversing armed criminal action judgment; (2) State v. Williams, 610 S.W.2d 644 (Mo.

Payne, 607 S.W.2d 822 (Mo. App. 1980), affirming on first degree robbery and reversing on armed criminal action; (4) State v. Counselman, 603 S.W.2d 3 (Mo. App. 1980), again affirming the first degree robbery conviction and setting aside the armed criminal action conviction; and, (5) State v. McGee, 602 S.W.2d 709 (Mo. App. 1980), reversing and remanding the conviction for assault with intent to do great bodily harm without malice, as well as vacating the armed criminal action conviction. These causes were transferred for Disposition in this court on June 2, 1981. Additionally, (6) State v. Lowery, 608 S.W.2d 445 (Mo. App. 1980), affirming the first degree robbery conviction but reversing on armed criminal action, was vacated and remanded by the United States Supreme Court to the Court of Appeals, Eastern District, with the above-quoted instruction. Missouri v. Lowery, U.S. (1981) (No. 80-1561, decided June 8, 1981). On June 22, 1981, the cause was transferred to be determined here. The Court's latest pronouncement occurred in Missouri v. Crews, U.S. (1981), (No. 80-1393, decided June 22, 1981), where the Court vacated and remanded to the Eastern District four additional cases with instructions to re-examine in the light of Albernaz : (7) State v. Crews, 607 S.W.2d 759 (Mo.App. 1980), affirming robbery and kidnapping convictions and reversing on armed criminal action; (8) State v. Crews, 607 S.W.2d 729 (Mo.App. 1980), again affirming first degree robbery and kidnapping judgments, but reversing the armed criminal action conviction; (9) State v. Helton, 607 S.W.2d 772 (Mo.App. 1980), affirming the first degree robbery conviction, yet reversing the armed criminal action judgment; and, (10) State v. Tunstall, 607 S.W.2d 809 (Mo.App. 1980), affirming the pronouncement of guilt of attempted first degree robbery, but reversing the armed criminal action conviction. These causes were transferred on July 9, 1981, for Disposition in this court.\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003eThe Supreme Court, on certiorari, vacated and remanded to the Court of Appeals, Western District, five cases, \"for further consideration in light of Albernaz v. United States, 450 U.S. (1981).\" Missouri v. Brown, U.S. (1981) (No. 80-1368, decided March 30, 1981). The overturned decisions, transferred here on June 11, 1981, include: (11) State v. Martin, 610 S.W.2d 18 (Mo.App. 1980), affirming on first degree robbery and reversing on armed criminal action; (12) State v. Greer, 609 S.W.2d 423 (Mo.App. 1980), affirming kidnapping, as well as rape and sodomy convictions, but reversing the armed criminal action convictions; (13) State v.

State, 607 S.W.2d 801 (Mo.App. 1980), upholding, on a motion for post-conviction relief, the first degree robbery conviction, while vacating the armed criminal action conviction; and (15) State v. Collins, 607 S.W.2d 781 (Mo.App. 1980), again affirming on first degree robbery, but reversing armed criminal action conviction.\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003eIn Missouri v.

United States, 450 U.S. RU RO (1981),\" (16) State v. Sinclair, 606 S.W.2d 271 (Mo.App. 1980), reversing an armed criminal action conviction, while affirming the second degree assault conviction. The cause was transferred on July 9, 1981, to this court for Disposition.\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003e2 The United States Supreme Court issued its mandate to this court to reconsider three cases \"in light of Albernaz v. United States, 450 U.S. (1981).\" Missouri v. Greer, U.S. (1981) (No. 80-997, decided May 26, 1981). The vacated cases were: (1) State v. Williams, 606 S.W.2d 777 (Mo. 1980) (Div. 1), affirming first degree robbery convictions and reversing on armed criminal action; (2) State v. Kendrick, 606 S.W.2d 643 (Mo. 1980) (Div. 2), again affirming on robbery first degree, but vacating the armed criminal action convictions; and, (3) State v. Greer, 605 S.W.2d 93 (Mo. 1980) (Div. 2), affirming the second degree murder conviction, but setting aside the armed criminal action judgment.\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003eIn addition to these cases on which the Supreme Court has taken action, there is pending in the Court a petition for certiorari filed by the State (bringing the total number of such petitions to 20) in response to a writ of issued by this court releasing Willie Williams. (See, Order of June 15, 1981, entered in Williams v. Wyrick, No. 62879.) This court also issued opinions in three cases today reversing armed criminal action, relying on Sours and Haggard : (1) State v. Fletcher, S.W.2d (Mo. banc 1981) (No. 62049, decided July 14, 1981), affirming kidnapping, rape and robbery convictions, but vacating a life sentence for armed criminal action; (2) State v. Gaskin, S.W.2d (Mo. 1981) (Div. 2) (No. 61433, decided July 14, 1981), affirming a verdict of first degree robbery (together with assault with intent to kill with malice aforethought) and reversing the armed criminal action conviction; and (3) State v. Pennington, S.W.2d (1981) (Div. 2) (No. 61928, decided July 14, 1981), affirming a robbery first degree conviction, but reversing a guilty verdict of armed criminal action. Past reversals and vacations of sentences not challenged by petition for certiorari number approximately 40, including another inmate released by writ of . (It should be noted that permitting successful challenge by thwarts the mandate of Wiglesworth v. Wyrick, 531 S.W.2d 713 (Mo. banc 1976), that Rule 27.26 provide the exclusive method by which to attack the validity of a conviction.) These figures, of course, merely represent the tip of the iceberg. They only begin to reflect the total number of criminal cases affected by Sours, for they do not include prosecutions for crimes involving a weapon in which armed criminal action was not charged or convictions of armed criminal action set aside by the trial court, all occurring after Sours I, January 15, 1980.\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003e3 It is of great interest that no statement of rationale was offered to explain how the majority selected the armed criminal action, vis a vis, the robbery conviction for reversal. One must ask, what theory of double jeopardy authorizes that result. This question, raised in my Dissent in Sours v. State, 603 S.W.2d 592, 607 1.c. 610 (Mo. banc 1980) (Sours II), went unanswered by the majority there. Again, in the case sub judice a similar ad hoc choice is made by the majority without citation of authority or explication of rationale. This is but another of the flaws inherent in the majority's position, and made particularly apparent by today's decision in State v. Fletcher, S.W.2d (Mo. banc 1981) (No. 62049, decided July 14, 1981), where the majority vacated a life sentence for armed criminal action, and upheld 15 year sentences for rape and kidnapping and a 30 year sentence for robbery. The State might well have preferred vacation of one of the lesser sentences, yet the majority, with its apparent distaste for armed criminal action, makes this choice for the State.\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003e4 A perusal of the brief reveals that mootness resulting from Sours' September release was a principal ground urged for denial of the State's petition.\u003c/span\u003e\n\n",
