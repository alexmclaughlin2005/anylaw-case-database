    "body": "Charles Shangler, Presiding Judge\n\nThis suit involves thirteen actions brought by thirty-two plaintiffs against Alcolac, Inc. and plant manager Fischer for injury to their persons and property from toxic spills and emissions from a chemical facility in Sedalia, Missouri. The actions, consolidated by order of the trial court, were in four counts and each sought recovery of compensatory and punitive damages. Only two counts were submitted to the jury: One, for the diminished market value of the residences, sounded in negligence. The jury, after a trial of more than four months, returned verdicts against Alcolac and awarded to each plaintiff on the claims for personal injury, $200,000 as compensatory damages and $1,387,096.70 as punitive damages. The award for property damage varied as to each claim. Alcolac thereafter moved for a judgment notwithstanding the verdict or, alternatively, for a new trial. The trial court denied judgment n.o.v., but granted a new trial as to damages only as to each of the thirty-one \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e1\u003c/span\u003e personal injury verdicts.\n\nThe several plaintiffs appeal the order to set aside the awards for personal injury damages on the negligence count and the grant of a new trial on those issues. Alcolac appeals the denial of judgment notwithstanding the verdict on both negligence and nuisance count, and the entry of judgment of liability on the negligence count.\n\nPART ONE\n\nThe Litigation History\n\nAlcolac commences its Sedalia operations in May of 1978. In July of 1979 five of the thirteen plaintiff families filed suit in Pettis County with complaints of injury from the Alcolac operations. The five suits were voluntarily dismissed in February of 1981. In December of 1981 the suits were refiled in Jackson County, othersuits were commenced, and eventually all were consolidated for trial. Alcolac made answer to the petitions. Alcolac also pleaded a multiple counterclaim. Count I was for Abuse of Process: that the plaintiffs and others in concert maliciously schemed to harass and force Alcolac to cease operations at the Pettis County Plant, and to that end commenced an unfounded suit against Alcolac in Pettis County, took no initiative to advance the litigation and later dismissed the suit, but resumed the litigation in Jackson County -- not for the redress or remedy of any civil wrong, but for ulterior purposes. Count II was for Civil Conspiracy: that the acts alleged against the plaintiffs on Count I constituted a civil conspiracy. Count III was in Prima Facie Tort: that the acts of the plaintiffs were intentionally done with the purpose to injure Alcolac, and without justification. The counterclaim sought recovery for compensatory and punitive damages as to each cause of action. Alcolac attempted proof of the cause of action through the cross-examination of the several plaintiffs, but without avail. At the Conclusion of all the evidence Alcolac dismissed the counterclaim against all theplaintiffs with prejudice. Accordingly, the appeal and cross-appeal are from a final judgment and engage our jurisdiction to review.\n\nWhat remained was a massive litigation of thirty-one separate causes to action, joined for adjudication through the amenity of consolidation, but tried, submitted and determined by the jury as separate suits. It was a litigation which engaged the jury from August 12, 1985 to December 23, 1985 [four and one-half months] presented one hundred and sixty-five witnesses as well as hundreds of exhibits, and is recorded in ten thousand pages of transcript. The counter-appeals contest not only the validity of the submissions and the verdicts as returned, but also the judgment of the court which validates the proof of the causes of action but nullifies the money amounts returned by each verdict for personal injury and punitive damages. Our review entails the determination of the submissions, the validity of the verdicts, and the propriety of the judgments entered by the court -- among the other claims of error.\n\nII\n\nA\n\nThe Alcolac Plant: Its Design and Operation\n\nAlcolac, Inc. manufacturers specialty chemical products for industry and commenced such operations in 1950 in the city of Baltimore. It is now an international company. The special chemicals manufactured by Alcolac include surfactants or soaps used in cosmetics and a range of other products. Functional monomers are building-block chemicals used to prepare polymers for adhesives, plastics, textiles, and such. The Alcolac management recognized the dangers to the environment from such production activity and so launched WAPORA, an environmental management subsidiary, which sells advice on pollution control to industry as well as government.\n\nAlcolac then sought a site in the Midwest for an additional facility, and selected an area contiguous to the city of Sedalia. To deal with the environmental concomitant of the planned facility in Sedalia, in 1975 Dr. Vsevolod Blinoff, founder and chairman of Alcolac, designated the top executives of the company as an ad hoc committee. They included Charles Anderson, Alcolac president, Peter Bouroff, Alcolac vice-president, Dr. Jacob Bregman, president of WAPORA, and Blinoff, himself. It befell Bregman and WAPORA to design the environmental control system for the Sedalia facility. The design Bregman and Blinoff envisioned was a model of environmental safety -- a plant [as described by Bregman] \"that could make products that were toxic and hazardous and yet keep them in such a manner that the environment would not be affected.\" It was specific Blinoff instruction that Bregman and WAPORA design and construct \"a zero discharge plant\" -- a state of the art model. Anderson, president of Alcolac and an accountant by training [described by Bregman as \"a bottom line kind of guy\"], opposed many of the environmental controls as too costly and \"a lot of baloney.\" The design was drawn and construction began nevertheless.\n\nThe composite facility included three production buildings: a building for the manufacturer of surfactants or soaps, another for the manufacturer of monomers, and an environmental control building. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e2\u003c/span\u003e The production from both the surfactant and monomer plants resulted in wastes, both in liquid and vapor form. It was the design of the pollution control processes at the plant to remove the organic chemical contaminants from the wastes, and to expunge their odors, before emission. The design provided for carbon filters and scrubbers to remove the contaminants and odors from the wastes, incinerators to consume the organic matter removed from the liquids and vapors, and pipe lines to emit the liquid an stacks to emit the vapors. It was the theory of the design that the pollution control processes would render the otherwise toxic and odorous wastes harmless to the environment.\n\nTo dispose of the liquid wastes, underground pipes ran from each of the three structures to four bio-oxidation ponds. There was also an underground pipeline between the monomer plant and the environmental control building. It was the function of the bio-oxidation ponds to degrade the contaminated remnants discharged into them through the conduits from the surfactant building and the environmental control building. The bio-oxidation ponds were designed on the same principle as any municipal sewage treatment lagoon: the ponds were filled with plain water and the bacteria allowed to develop; as the wastewaters [theoretically scrubbed free and filtered of contaminants] are gradually introduced, the bacteria degrade them. Thus, the design, as applied to both the surfactant and the monomer wastes, intends that the organic chemical contaminants be removed before discharge into the bioponds.\n\nIn the case of the soap plant, the wastes were to be treated by acid scrubbers to remove the chemical residues and odors from the liquid and vapors. The liquid was then effused into the biopond and the waste vapors, then also cleansed of any acid mist, were admitted through the surfactant stack.\n\nIn the case of the monomer plant -- where toxic chemicals were used for production -- one liquid waste stream flowed into the environmental control building and over carbon filters for the removal of the organic materials before discharge into the biopond for biodegradation. The other liquid waste, suspensions of undissolved organic particulates, was piped into the liquid incinerator for burning, then through scrubbers to clean the odors, before emission into the atmosphere as vapor. The toxic vapor wastes from the reactors in the monomer production process were filtered through a system of carbon beds in the monomer building and the organic residues burned off in the \"fume incinerator\" before emission. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e3\u003c/span\u003e\n\nThe design intended, therefore, that the liquid emerge from both the surfactant and monomer plants free of organic matter and then flow into the bioponds as uncontaminated wastewater. It was the theory of the design that the wastewater then biodegrade through a series of four bio-oxidation ponds, each of which retained the wastewater for thirty days before it flowed by gravity into the next pond, and finally collected [after the 120-day cycle] into a sedimentation pond for reuse -- either for field irrigation or as washwater for the plant reactors.\n\nThis system of controls notwithstanding, both the monomer and environmental control buildings were designed with valves meant to be unlocked only for the release of wash water and storm water to the bioponds. Instead, operators in the monomer and environmental control buildings at times used the valves to bypass the waste treatment features of the facilities and pipe raw, untreated toxic chemical wastes directly into the open air bio-oxidation ponds outside. Also, the wastewater from the monomer process was intended for discharge into biopond one, and that from the surfactant process into process into biopond two -- [presumably, because the soap wastewater was more readily biodegraded than the monomer wastewater]. Notwithstanding, it was the recurrent practice to emit both the soap wastewater as well as the untreated monomer wastewater into biopond one, with the result that the toxic monomer wastewater intermixed with the soap wastewater and was borne off the Alcolac premises as puffs of foam. Notwithstanding also the sense of the design that the liquid incinerator function as the means of disposal of particulate contaminant wastes from the monomer process, the device malfunctioned from the outset of Alcolac operations and, in mid-1981, was discarded as a means for the disposal of toxic waste.\n\nB\n\nSTARTUP OF OPERATIONS 1978\n\nAlcolac operates under license of the Missouri Department of Natural Resources . That agency has the primary responsibility to enforce environmental compliance. Alcolac is also monitored by the Environmental Protection Agency and the Occupational Safety and Health Administrations .\n\nAlcolac commenced operations in the Sedalia plant in May of 1978. Some months earlier, in November of 1977, Bregman had circulated to Blinoff, Anderson, Bouroff and Fischer [then plant manager], a memorandum of \"comments on the Sedalia plant start-up.\" Bregman had recently visited the facility and noted a number of problems he wanted to be certain were corrected before the onset of production. He explained: \"They have to do with pollution control systems, and very heavy emphasis on training the plant personnel.\" The memorandum recommended, among others, that all pollution control equipment required for proper operation of the plant be installed and tested before the \"first batch\" of production; that all plant personnel \"go through an intense training session on the use of the pollution control manual\" [the Environmental Control Systems Operating Manual devised for the plant by WAPORA]; that \" system of very close checking of the bio-oxidation ponds for odors\" be established to ensure that \"no noticeable odors from them get anywhere near the property lines or the Alcolac building.\" These goals, Bregman concluded, were never met.\n\nAlcolac began production nevertheless some six months later, and almost from the start the liquid incinerator and the bio-oxidation pond systems were sources of complaint. The incinerator emitted vapors and hazes over the environs and the bio-oxidationponds emitted odors. Alcolac called on WAPORA to allay these problems. Bregman assigned to David Boies, the engineer who had designed the Alcolac plant, the liquid incinerator concern, and to bio-oxidation ponds odor concern. Boies and Reid concluded the assignments and reported to Bregman.\n\nReid completed the first phase of the assignment in July of 1978 and in a memorandum expressed concern that the carbon filter system in the environmental control building was used to overload with the consequence that toxic wastes from the monomer process were allowed to enter the bio-oxidation ponds. A month later Reid resumed the investigation and found the bio-oxidation ponds still toxic as well as odorous. Reid also discovered on that second visit that the drain valves which lead from the monomer building to the bioponds were not locked closed as normal procedure intended. This allowed chemical spills in the monomer building to flow directly into the waste pipes of the environmental control building for discharge into the biopond without any prior cleansing in the liquid incinerator. Dr. Reid not only reported to Alcolac that the ponds were being contaminated with toxic wastes, but that the toxic chemicals lighter than water could attach themselves to the foam created by the aerators in the bioponds and be blown in the air or become vapor -- and so present a hazard to the environment. Dr. Ried also recommended that an additional aerator be installed in the bioponds to infuse the water with more oxygen, and so dispel the odors. Reid also reported to WAPORA, by a later memorandum of October 31, 1978, with copies to Anderson and Bouroff at Alcolac, that the chemical data collected indicated that the biopond was receiving loadings of over 18 times design conditions.\n\nReid continued the investigations into 1979. The increments of chemical wastes from the increased production outstripped the capacity of the bio-ponds to degrade the chemicals so that a sludge accumulated at the bottom of the lagoons. Odors were emitted of the \"rotten egg type, which were probably from hydrogen sulfide.\" On several occasions Reid experienced \"a burning type sensation to the odor coming off the lagoons\" to the membranes of the nose. His reports noted also that the acid scrubbers in the surfactant building were not as effective as expected so that soap flowed into the bio-oxidation ponds and put an additional stress on a system already overburdened. Other memoranda reported to Alcolac and plant manager Fischer that the employee who operated in the environmental control building was untrained, and not \"capable of doing a proper job.\" A memorandum to Anderson at Alcolac in June of 1979 reported other problems: the rupture of a disk [a monomer reactor safety device] which sprayed toxic chemicals into the air. That memorandum also reported that a drain outside the environmental control building discharged untreated chemicals into a ditch and from thence into the atmosphere -- among other numerous erratic environmental practices noted as to Alcolac. Reid reported also that strainers on the pumps in the monomer building clogged, so that the pits overfilled with the consequence that the raw untreated chemical waste flowed directly to the bio-oxidation ponds, still toxic. Reid noted also on the occasion of another visit to the Alcolac plan t a spill of dodecylbenzene sulfonic acid at the surfactant plant. He commented also that the environmental technician was untrained. He noted that the position was very important \"as any data he produces must be valid\" and urged that LeMaire be trained. Reid urged also that the employees be impressed with the requirement for good environmental control measures. He observed that the plant lacked a \"spill response program\" -- a team trained and equipped to handle spills of corrosive and hazardous chemicals in order to prevent damage to personnel and the environment.\n\nIn August of 1979, the Reid memorandum cited evidence of several major chemical spills -- which \"probably violate either or both Federal or State law.\" He commented, \"oth were serious and major spills which could pollute either streams or groundwater acquifers.\" That memorandum concluded with the summary: \"There seems to be new problems developing at the plant each time I visit,\" and urged management \"to take a highly active role in enforcing the proper conduct of employees to reduce danger to the personnel health and to the environment.\" It concluded: \"Haphazard handling of chemicals should not be tolerated.\"\n\nReid submitted numerous recommendations to Anderson and the other Alcolac officials on solutions to the bioponds pollution problem -- with specifications, design calculations and cost estimates -- but every recommendation met resistance or delay in implementation. In addition to the memoranda, Reid warned the Alcolac officials that the environmental problems would exacerbate. The major concern, as he saw it, was that the chemical waste from the increase in the production schedule \"would overcome [the improvement to the bioponds] we had planned before it even got installed.\" The ultimate resistance to the recommended solutions \"clear at the top\" -- Alcolac president Anderson. Reid had the impression that Alcolac either did not have the money to spend or did not want to spend the money.\n\nBoies also pursued his assignment of June, 1978, to investigate the liquid incinerator and also reported to Bregman. Boies died in 1980, five years before the trial, so Bregman related the results of that phase of the investigation. In the course of the investigation in June of 1978, Boies paid a visit to the woman who complained that the liquid incinerator caused vapor and smoke to drift over her home, and Boies made apology. Boies composed a detailed memorandum about that incident, gave it to Bregman, and sent a copy to Alcolac. Anderson, irate that Boies should have apologized, demanded that \"Boies be pulled of the project and to be put on it anymore.\" Blinoff, the founder of Alcolac and champion of \"a zero discharge plant\" had died by then, and Anderson succeeded him as the dominant figure in Alcolac. Thus, Bregman acceded to the Anderson demand, and removed Boies from the Sedalia project.\n\nBoies had written other memorandum concerning his investigation of the Sedalia project, but they were missing from the WAPORA files. Bregman still retained a related document, however -- a typewritten draft of a proposed memorandum to Alcolac prepared by Boies and submitted to Bregman, who inscribed his comments. The memorandum in final form -- circulated to Anderson and other Alcolac officials -- was also missing from the document at hand. The memorandum was a catalog of \"things that were remaining to be done\" to bring the pollution control systems to proper function. One item commented: \"No one person responsible for pollution control.\" It meant, Bregman explained, the \"Alcolac did not have a trained competent person who looked at the pollution control systems, made sure they operated right.\" Another item commented that the \"sampling points on the vent absorber units\" were not yet installed, and hence \"whether stuff was escaping into the air or not and how much or what\" could could not be determined. Alcolac always responded \"they were too busy running the plant to do this.\" Another item commented that the major problem as to water pollution control was that \"a much higher organic load than had been predicted\" was emitted into the bio-oxidatoin ponds. That is to say, the production of organic compounds at Alcolac exceeded the design level based upon the production prediction provided by Dr. Bouroff. The result was that a much higher organic load wound up in the oxidation ponds than allowed for by the design. Another item commented that the Alcolac employees were not using the record forms supplied by WAPORA to monitor the bio-oxidation ponds.\n\nAnother \"major basic problem\" the Boies memorandum mentioned was from the operation of the liquid incinerator, which generated haze in the atmosphere. Bregman explained that the local residents were restive about that condition of pollution, and the newspaper reported the uneasiness. Bregman assured the citizenry at a meeting that \"these things were going to be solved.\" That condition apparently came to the attention of the Department of Natural Resources, and Alcolac officials, Anderson and plant manager Fischer, in the company of Bregman met with the agency in Jefferson City. Bregman and the others disclosed to DNR the plans for air pollution control, and the agency was satisfied. Anderson informed WAPORA shortly after that meeting that Alcolac would \"handle all future dealings with the State of Missouri\" without \"involvement\" of WAPORA. The eventual consequence rather was to remove WAPORA as consultant altogether. In the interim, however, Bregman -- as requested by Alcolac -- met with another citizens' group, an environmental committee, to allay the concerns of the Sedalia citizenry and to assure them that the air pollution problems would be resolved. Bregman then still believed that the recommendations of the Boies memorandum, as well as his own, would be implemented. Anderson refused them, however, because: \"t cost too much money.\"\n\nAlcolac discharges WAPORA from the Sedalia project in December of 1979. A month or so before, Bregman dispatched a last memorandum to Alcolac president Anderson and vice-president Bouroff, among others. A copy of that memorandum was also missing from the WAPORA files. Bregman, however, retained a sketch, written in his personnel hand, from which the formal problems at Sedalia, the present state of those problems, and recommended solutions. The memorandum noted once again, as before, the need for a strong and experienced engineer for the maintenance of the expensive and complex pollution control equipment, that the standard operating procedure delineated in the Environmental Control Systems Operating Manual composed by WAPORA for the Sedalia plant be observed -- all recommendations already made to Alcolac by WAPORA but not implemented. The memorandum informed Alcolac, that the monomer plant was producing three times the chemical waste the design capacity of the bio-oxidation ponds allowed. Bregman reported also that the odors were caused by the \"sloppy handling\" of the chemicals used in the monomer process and could pose a considerable toxic control problem if not handled correctly. It was communicated to Alcolac, also, that a number of the chemicals used in the monomer production had \"significant air pollution potential\" so that the plant environmental control system needed to be flexible and reliable. Among the chemicals specifically mentioned as environmental hazards were allyl alcohol, dimethyl sulfate, epichlorohydrin, ethyl acrylate, methyl methacrylate and toluene sulfonic acid.\n\nBregman testified that Anderson refused to implement the recommendations of the last memorandum, as he had the predecessors, as too costly. Bregman deemed the environmental system designed for Alcolac worthy of a national prize, and told Anderson that \"if he would fix this up, we would have the best one going\" -- but to no avail. In December of 1979, Alcolac president Anderson removed WAPORA from the Sedalia project. Bregman cited -- as of that date of departure -- the continued reluctance by Anderson to spend the funds necessary for these essential pollution controls: $150,000 to install hydrocarbon monitors; another $100,000 or so for an aerator system to facilitate the oxidation of the excess chemical wastes in the ponds due to unforeseen increased production, and about $500,000 to $1,000,000 to redo the liquid incinerator. Bregman reiterated as the \"single-most important factor\" to a proper system of environmental control \"a highly qualified environmental engineer to make sure that the systems work and to give the fellow the authority to make corrections when they don't work.\" It was a recommendation Anderson \"strongly opposed,\" because of the salary entailed, and because the \"corrections\" would involve \"an ongoing expense.\"\n\nSome two years later, after the commencement of suit against Alcolac, Bregman heard from Anderson once again. As Bregman related the incident, Anderson said that \"there were some kooks who filed a lawsuit\" and he asked Bregman \"to destroy the WAPORA project file on the Sedalia project.\" Bregman refused the request as \"unethical, probably illegal and certainly unprofessional.\" Of the two files at WAPORA on the Sedalia project, one disappeared altogether.\n\nAlcolac president Anderson was called by the plaintiffs and was examined as an adverse witness. Anderson was a member of the ad hoc committee appointed by Alcolac founder and chairman, Dr. Vsevolod Blinoff, and so was involved in the decisions on the design and construction of the Sedalia plant - the environmental control system, included. Anderson acknowledged that as early as January of 1978, he was aware the Sedalia production process involved many dangerous and highly toxic chemicals. He acknowledged also the numerous WAPORA reports and recommendations, written and spoken, during 1978 and 1979 [the first two years of Sedalia operations] concerning the improvement of the environmental control systems and that Alcolac was not willing to spend money to implement them all.\n\nThey did [according to Anderson] use the Environmental Control Systems Operating Manual prepared by WAPORA at the Sedalia facility. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e4\u003c/span\u003e Alcolac did purchase one of the eleven hydrocarbon systems recommended by WAPORA to monitor chemical emissions. That monitor did not function, however, and Alcolac depended on periodic samples taken from the stacks and dispatched to independent testers - \"several times over a couple of years\" - in lieu of the analytic monitors WAPORA found essential to detect, warn of and control the toxic emissions. The liquid incinerator had not functioned effectively from the outset of production so that in May of 1980 [after the dismission of WAPORA] Alcolac vice-president Bouroff was prompted to report to president Anderson among the items of \"Progress As Of May 1980\":\n\nItems 1 \u0026 2: Our liquid incinerator has the poorest performance ever seen. Most of the time it is out of commission due to all kinds of mechanical problems. It is an absolute waste of time and money. We consider it a 100% failure and the most costly operation. Also, part of our environmental problems were/are caused by this piece of equipment. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e5\u003c/span\u003e\n\nThe malfunction notwithstanding, Alcolac continued to use the incinerator as the mode to dispose of the liquid waste. The result was that the waste was only partially incinerated, if at all, so that the residue was vented into the atmosphere still as toxic, or even more so, than before. In 1981, the use of the liquid incinerator was discontinued altogether. The hazardous waste intended for disposal by that method was hauled away thereafter.\n\nAnderson recalled that during one of his periodic sojourns at the Sedalia plant - in 1978 or 1979 - he had occasion to visit Charlotte Phillips [an eventual plaintiff] at her home north of the facility to discuss a complaint of odors. He never knew of any incidents of odors from Alcolac \"going beyond the property boundaries\" and contested her testimony that on the occasion of that visit the odors were so pronounced \"that everyone's eyes were watering and people were choking,\" including Anderson, himself. Nor had Anderson ever seen foam from the bio-oxidation ponds \"blow beyond the bounds of the Alcolac property\" except for a photograph in evidence which depicted such an accumulation beyond the bournes of Alcolac. He conceded, however, that \"e have been cited by the DNR [Department of Natural Resources] for odors that have gone off of our property before.\" The numerous complaints of odors from Alcolac made by neighbors of the plant, he said, were personally investigated and never corroborated. The complaints of odors, Anderson said, were unfounded. Anderson conceded that he was advised that the bioponds were regularly being overloaded, but on one occasion only, and then by Dr. Reid. He acknowledged that Alcolac employee Joseph LeMaire was the person Dr. Reid alluded to in his 1979 report as the environmental control technician totally untrained and incompetent for such a position. Anderson was adamant, however, despite even the testimony of LeMaire to the contrary, mental control technician. Anderson acknowledged that Alcolac officials had met with the DNR some ten times since 1978 concerning the emission and odor problems at the Sedalia facility. He denied any overture to Bregman to destroy the WAPORA files consequent to the initiation of suit by these plaintiffs.\n\nJoseph LeMaire was employed at Alcolac between August of 1977 and January of 1984. His testimony as to his employment function and the regularity of the plant operations was in essential contraction to that given by Alcolac president Anderson. His service with Alcolac, therefore, encompassed the entire period of the WAPORA presence there - and beyond. LeMaire came to Alcolac at the age of eighteen years as a maintenance worker and groundskeeper. He had dropped out of school at the 10th grade, but later gained the General Equivalency Diploma. That was the extent of his formal education. In the summer of 1979, the employee in charge of the environmental control building was discharged for drunkenness on the job, and [according to LeMaire] without training or even the guidance of an operation manual, LeMaire was placed in charge of environmental control technician.\" LeMaire described the process by which the environmental control building devices were designed to function: the liquid waste stream from the monomer plant [where the most toxic chemicals were used] was conducted into a sump pit in the environmental building and from there was filtered over charcoal Calgon units and the liquid, as treated, was then discharged into biopond one.\n\nLeMaire described episodes of repeated chemical spills at the plant. Toxic spills were often 'push down the drain with squeegees.\" The valves which controlled the monomer drains were kept open as a matter of course so that the spilled toxic liquid flowed directly into the environmental control sump pit and was allowed to discharge into the biopond without completion of the charcoal decontamination process. Also, on occasion, the environmental control drains would become so overloaded that the waste liquid backed up, and the waste was routed around the environmental control filtration system, still toxic, directly into the biopond. On other occasions, the toxic liquid overflow was simply allowed to drain from the environmental control building to the outdoors, and from thence into Little Shaver Creek. LeMaire could detect the odors of toluene and allyl methacrylate, among other toxic compounds, from these \"washdown waters\" from the monomer building. LeMaire also described occasional dispersions of chemicals into the atmosphere from explosions in the monomer plant [a phenomenom noticed by the WAPORA report of Dr. Reid to Alcolac president Anderson]. The exposure to these toxic wastes burned the eyes, irritated the throat and impaired the breathing. LeMaire described the odors emitted by biopond one as of \"rotten eggs or a bad sewer system,\" or sometimes, \"a sweet smell, or a sour, bitter, smell,\" depending on which untreated chemical wastes were in the pond.\n\nThe \"washdown from the soap plant\" also collected in bio-oxidation pond one. Thus, when the chemical wastes from the monomer building were released directly into the pond uncleansed by filtration, they mixed in that toxic state with the suds from the soap building. Those suds, LeMaire observed, left the Alcolac premises \"like a snowstorm\" whenever the wind blew, and at times built the suds to a height of \"close to 15, 20 feet tall.\" LeMaire and the other workers, accoutered in protective gear, attempted to control these occurrences with sprays or other such substances.\n\nLeMaire recounted that during his service at the Alcolac plant, the Department of Natural Resources made periodic inspections. Alcolac received advance notice of the prospective inspections and \"cleanup parties\" were held to prepare the plant for the inspectors. The agency discontinued the inspections when the plaintiffs commenced these lawsuits, and then \"the cleanup parties stopped.\" LeMaire was terminated from employment in January of 1984 shortly after he suggested to Alcolac president Anderson and vice-president Bouroff that the Missouri Department of Conservation be summoned to investigate the death of numerous fish in a pond which adjoined the plant. Anderson did not recall the episode, although he acknowledged LeMaire was fired. It was the installation of a twenty-year-old with no training as environmental control technician which prompted Reid to comment in a WAPORA memorandum to Alcolac that the appointment \"made a joke of [the WAPORA] recommendations.\"\n\nPaul Faulconer worked at the Alcolac plant and confirmed, and enlarged on, the operational malfunctions described by LeMaire. He worked there for six months from April of 1979, and so his service was during the WAPORA presence at the plant. Faulconer was not trained for work at a chemical plant when employed, and received no training prior to commencement of work. His function was that of chemical operator in the surfactant plant. Faulconer was assigned one time to the monomer plant with a coworker. There was a spill while he was there from the reactor of about a quart of allyl alcohol. The almost immediate effect was to swell the eyes shut. The maintenance personnel washed down the spill accoutered in self-contained respiratory units. In the process, they opened the doors to vent the allyl alcohol vapors on his sinuses and eyes.\n\nThe operations at the soap plant were plagued by continual breakdowns caused by lack of maintenance: overhead lines ruptured, pumps failed, and other malfunctions resulted. The toxic vapors released from the ruptures were simply vented into the atmosphere. When the sulphur burner in the soap plant broke down, so that sulphur dioxide fumes filled the building, the employees were instructed to wait until after dark, then open the doors and release the fumes into the atmosphere. At those times, the fumes became so thick that employees in the soap-based products in the surfactant plant involved sulphur and its compounds. Waste from that process included vapors of sulphuric acid, sulphur trioxide, and other chemical residues. It was a function of the acid scrubbers to cleanse the residues from the wastes before they were emitted, nontoxic and neutral, into the atmosphere through the stack. When the acid scrubbers malfunctioned, but production continued nevertheless [as were the instructions of management], the vapors - still contaminated - and acid mist were emitted from the stack in the form of a plume, and sometimes as soap bubbles. The acid scrubbers malfunctioned 70% of the time. The smell from the plume was \"very foul.\" When that residue descended, the grass turned brown, and irritated the skin it touched.\n\nThere were also repeated chemical spills. They occurred regularly, about once a week, usually at the start-up and shut-down phases of the production process. If the spill was in the plant, it was flushed down the drain and discharged into biopond one. The consequence was \"a big pile of soap bubbles floating across the road\" mixed with whatever toxic chemicals were in the pond. If the spill was outside the plant, the spill was merely covered over with dirt. On one such occasion, some two to three thousand pounds of duodubonicsulfonic acid were released. Other outside spills resulted from the overfill of outside chemical storage tanks of multi-ton capacity. Another source of outside spills was from the storage of the liquid waste products. That residue [presumably because the liquid incinerator continued to malfunction] was place in several thousands of drums outside the buildings for transport and disposal. Some of the drums leaked so that the contents filtered into Shaver Creek. Others would be smashed by the semi-trailers, and the contents laid open. Other drums exploded in the August sun and spewed the contents.\n\nFaulconer described incidents when trucks came to be loaded to transport the surfactant products, but were refused by the employees because remnants of hazardous chemicals from the prior haul remained in the vans. The truckers simply drove a short distance off the premises, drained off the toxic matter, and returned for loads. It was a practice, Faulconer said, known by Alcolac and tolerated.\n\nThere was a logbook used to communicate between the production shifts. It contained instructions by production manager Gibbs as to the chemicals to be produced and the quantity. It was also used to report spills. Faulconer was instructed by Gibbs not to record a spill in the logbook until it was discussed with management first. He testified that only \"ten, maybe twenty percent\" of the spills he observed at the soap plant were recorded in the log. The spills usually recorded were the \"non-hazardous type spills . . . five gallons of this, ten gallons of that.\" Those spills considered hazardous, Faulconer testified, were never noted in that log, or anywhere else, during his employment at Alcolac.\n\nFaulconer confirmed the LeMaire testimony that Alcolac somehow got two or three days advance warning of Missouri Department of Natural Resources inspections, and that advisement was transmitted to the employees by production manager Gibbs. According to Faulconer, the Alcolac management instructed Faulconer and the others to \"keep your mouth shut, don't volunteer any information.\" Faulconer was discharged - he contended - two weeks after he contacted the president of the union at the Alcolac plant in Baltimore [the Sedalia plant was nonunion] for advice about better maintenance and safety procedures at Sedalia. He took that initiative, Faulconer testified, only after he had approached Gibbs about better plant safety and was told \"to keep mouth shut.\"\n\nC\n\nPlant Operations After WAPORA\n\nAlcolac dismissed WAPORA from the Sedalia plant project in December of 1979. The urgent WAPORA recommendations - for a trained environmental engineer, employee training in pollution control, a restored liquid incinerator, the installation of eleven hydrocarbon systems to monitor emissions, and an aerator system sufficient to oxidate the increased influx of chemical waste into the bioponds - all remained unfulfilled.\n\nComplaints by residents in the environs of Alcolac [some of them eventual plaintiffs, and others not] of odors, suds, fumes and bodily ailments from those and other emissions were made to Alcolac, to public officials, and then to the Missouri Department of Natural Resources almost from the outset of operations. The DNR was drawn into contact with the Alcolac facility in Sedalia by a complaint of odors by Gwendolyn Lawrence, a nearby resident and eventual plaintiff. The response to that first complaint was by Ann Gessley, environmental specialist with the Division of Environmental Quality of the DNR in Jefferson City, Missouri. She arrived in Sedalia a week later to interview Ms. Lawrence - in August of 1978. The investigator on that occasion detected \"a slight odor,\" and then proceeded to measure the odors around the circumference of the plant by means of a scentometer. That device allows a tester to measure the concentration of an odor by inhalations of comparative volumes of odor-free air [freshened by the carbon filter of the scentometer] and odorous air. A dilution ratio of 7 to 1 between the filtered and ambient air constitutes an \"excessive emission\" according to the standards of the federal Clean Air Act enforced by the DNR. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e6\u003c/span\u003e Ms. Gessley then entered Alcola, informed then plant manager Fischer of the complaint, and was conducted through the facility. She had occasion to inspect the plant several times thereafter but acknowledged that she was qualified to enforce odor regulations, but not as to the \"goings on of a chemical plant.\" Ms. Gessley testified that she never undertook to determine the source of the odors on the occasion of that first complaint, but her written report suggests that \"the waste lagoon could be the source of the odors.\" She doubted, however, that the biopond was the cause of the burning sensations the complaint of Ms. Lawrence described.\n\nThe recurrent complaints of odors and bodily discomforts from Alcolac emissions entailed frequent returns to Sedalia by Ms. Gessley and other DNR specialists. They conducted repeated surveillances around the Alcolac perimeter and often detected odors, but no violations - that is, odors diluted in a ratio of 7 to 1 by the scentometer test. Ms. Gessley acknowledged that the elapse of the two hours or so between the receipt of the complaint in Jefferson City and the arrival of DNR personnel in Sedalia \"was why we couldn't get a violation.\" That is to say, whatever odors may have been emitted at the time of the complaint were often dissipated by the time an official test was possible. It was to allay that conundrum that the DNR empowered Sedalia officials - first the Director of Civilian Defense of Pettis County and then the Sedalia Police Department - to respond to complaints and to investigate by means of the scentometer. In a memorandum concerning a successive \"walk-through\" inspection of the Alcolac plant in October of 1978, Gessley did note \"foaming problems\" in biopond No. 1, and noted also that the management \"plans to reroute discharge sulfactant plant to second and third cells .\" Gessley concluded her service with the DNR, and hence responsibility for the complaints of the Alcolac operation, at the close of 1979.\n\nThe response to the citizen complaints about the Alcolac operation, and the surveillances, by the DNR continued through Charles Crawford, a section chief of the air pollution control program, and others of his inspection group. Crawford testified that his division responded to over fifty complaints about Alcolac during his service in that function throughout 1979 and 1980. These responses then still originated from the Jefferson City office of the DNR, and Crawford participated in about fifteen of them. They comprised of surveillances and scentometer measurements. Crawford explained that, as to citizen complaints, because of the lag time between the receipt of the complaints at Sedalia and the arrival of the DNR in response, DNR \"pretty much drew a blank on really getting anything to constitute a violation.\" He acknowledged on cross-examination, however, that in an official letter to The Sedalia Democrat, he commented that in the two years which preceded the abatement agreement between Alcolac and the DNR [on May 30, 1980] \"we found several violations of the state odor regulation at Alcolac.\" There were also citizen complaints of foam as well as of physical ailments from the Alcolac operations.\n\nRichard Nikkila, chief of the enforcement section of the DNR in 1979, and then in 1980 staff director for the air pollution control program of the agency, first made contact with Alcolac during a \"walk-through\" inspection of the plant with Ms. Gessley. Such \"walk-through\" inspections were not to determine compliance, but simply \"what is in operation and what controls are in place.\" In 1979 his office inaugurated the policy of increased surveillance of the plant for excessive odors, which Ms. Gessley and others then implemented. There were occasions when the scentometer measured excessive emissions, and Nikilla recalled that about four notices for such excesses issued to Alcolac from the DNR office from such surveillances. A series of notices of excessive emissions issued to Alcolac on citizens complaints as well.\n\nOn March 7, 1980, Nikkila served upon Alcolac a notice of excessive emissions. That investigation was prompted by the complaint of Ms. Lawrence in Sedalia to the DNR in Jefferson City of odors from the Alcolac plant. Nikkila and Hastings, another DNR official, arrived from Jefferson City an hour and a half later. The odors were palpable to them even without the use of a scentometer, and both of them detected successive measurements at the 7 to 1 dilution ratio. They found the source: an exposed portion of the waste stream from the monomer building.\n\nOn March 14, 1980, an investigation of another complaint of odors from Alcolac resulted in another \"notice of excess emissions.\" Alcolac was instructed to \"determine the cause of the odor\" and to achieve compliance by March 24, 1980. On April 30, 1980, Nikkila received two complaints of dark smoke and odors from the Alcolac surfactant plant. A nearby resident [and former plaintiff now deceased], Ms. Landon, complained that she had been overcome by odors some days before and became unconscious. Mr. Landon [also a plaintiff] complained that the emissions aggravated his emphysema. Nikkila came to Sedalia, took scentometer readings around the Alcolac perimeter and recorded measurements of 7 to 1 - \"excess emissions.\"\n\nOn April 30, 1980, as a result of the investigation of a citizen complaint of dark smoke and odors from the Alcolac plant, Nikkila issued a notice of excess emissions. Nikkila gave notice of excess emissions to the laboratory technician, in the absence of plant manager Sutton. Alcolac interposed a \"malfunction plea\" against the April 30 notice of excess emissions which was rejected by the DNR after investigation. The official response by Nikkila for the DNR to plant manager Sutton for Alcolac on May 22, 1980 concluded.\n\nSince this is the third notice of excess emissions that you have received and the second which has been upgraded to a notice of violation, we intend to request issuance of an abatement order by the Director, Department of Natural Resources.\n\nSutton, in turn, issued a memorandum on that very date, May 22, 1980, to all Alcolac employees on the subject: \"Odor and Pollution Control.\"\n\nDuring the past three months we have been cited three times by the Air Pollution Enforcement Division of the Department of Natural Resources for excessive odor emissions. These citations are serious and will probably result in further action from the DNR. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e7\u003c/span\u003e\n\nThe memorandum then gave the causes of the citations and complaints as \"human error\" in the operations which \"could have been prevented had proper procedures been followed.\" It cautioned that \"further operating errors or causes of odors will be very serious could result in additional citations and ultimately the shut down of the plant.\"\n\nThese episodes prompted the DNR to issue an abatement order which directed Alcolac to cease the emission of odors in excess of the restriction imposed by its regulation. That order of abatement was superseded by an abatement agreement concluded between the DNR and Alcolac on May 30, 1980. Its purpose [according to Nikkila] was to correct what the surveillances and investigations determined were the \"significant sources of odor.\" Alcolac undertook, by its terms, to implement nine projects and procedures:\n\n1. To install a single automatically timed hydrocarbon monitor to sample the emissions from each stack of the vapor incinerator and carbon adsorption system in the monomer building, equipped with a manual noise alarm when the limit for the hydrocarbon concentration is reached. The baseline data for the hydrocarbon concentration cut off limits was to be established by Alcolac and submitted to DNR for approval by December 1, 1980, and the alarm was to be installed thereafter by January 12, 1981.\n\n2. To draft a written plan for the handling and control of the excess hydrocarbon concentration in the vapor incinerator and carbon adsorption system in the monomer building for DNR preliminary approval by November 10, 1980.\n\n3. To implement by February 1, 1981 a system to determine on a one time basis the nature and concentrations of the emissions from the stacks of the vapor incinerator and carbon adsorption system for each product manufactured by Alcolac in the monomer building.\n\n4. To install and operate an alkaline scrubber to remove 99.5% of the acrylates in the gaseous waste streams from the monomer building reactors and storage tanks. Alcolac undertook to report a completed and efficient operation of the installation to the DNR by June 30, 1981.\n\n5. To install and operate an alkaline scrubber to remove 99.5% of the acrylates from the liquid waste streams from the hot wells in the vacuum system of the reactors in the monomer building. Alcolac undertook to report a completed and sufficient operation of the installation to the DNR by July 15, 1981.\n\n6. To develop and submit to the DNR by November 7, 1980 a plan and procedure for the routine analysis and changing of activated carbon in all carbon adsorption units so that the carbon is replaced before breakthrough of gaseous wastes.\n\n7. To test, by November 24, 1980 and semi-annually thereafter, for emissions of sulfur dioxide and sulfur trioxide acid mist from the surfactant plant stack in accordance with the method approved by agency regulation.\n\n8. To store - immediately - all drummed waste materials in either the monomer building, environmental control building or the warehouse.\n\n9. To develop for DNR approval by November 15, 1980, a plan for the training of employees as to the control of odorous emissions from potential sources at the facility.\n\nThe abatement agreement did not prescribe any projects or procedures to further control emissions of odorous matter from the bioponds. Nikkila gave as reasons that the additional infusions of dilution water into the ponds and the installation of a system of aeration led the DNR to conclude that the bioponds \"were no longer anaerobic, o in our view, that was not an issue to take up with Alcolac.\"\n\nIt is the sense of the Nikkila testimony that the terms of the abatement agreement were met, with exceptions. Project 3, the system to determine on a one time basis the nature and concentrations of the emissions from the monomer building stacks, was never completed. Project 1, the hydrocarbon monitor, was installed but reported inoperative by Alcolac on December 8, 1981, and the manual reset alarm for that system was not actually installed until May 22, 1984. Project 8 called for the immediate storage of all drummed waste into one of the designated buildings which were designed to collect odors through the system of activated carbon. Alcolac, however, had adopted a plan to dispose of the physical inventory of 3000 drums at the rate of 500 per week, so that the removals would not be complete until July of 1980. A number of those containers leaked ethyl acrylate and other toxic chemicals so that they were transferred to sound drums. Nikkila could not say how Project 8 was ultimately performed.\n\nThe abatement agreement notwithstanding, Nikkila acknowledged, the problem of odorous emissions was not resolved. The chemical spills continued also. The citizen complaints of odors from the Alcolac operation, the official detection of excessive emissions, and the citation for violations persisted. On August 15, 1980, a DNR investigation in response to a citizen complaint resulted in a notice of excess emissions to Alcolac. The Alcolac plea of malfunction was denied, and the emissions officially attributed to Alcolac negligence. In year 1981, the DNR files recorded notices of excessive emissions from a variety of operational incidents: foam off the bioponds carried beyond the Alcolac property; chemical spills, and from the malfunction of the carbon bed [and so officially excused]. The complaints of intrusive foam became so recurrent that then plant manager Sutton refused to accept any further notices of excess emissions from the DNR officials. Alcolac called Nikkila on May 14, 1981 to report a spill of allyl glycidil ether residue outside the monomer building to account for odors. An official inspection of the Alcolac plant in 1983 discovered off-premises odors in concentrations in excess of the 31 to 1 ratio. The complaints and official notices of excess emissions to Alcolac continued throughout 1983 and into 1985 - a short time before the trial began.\n\nIn mid-1983, in order to improve the complaint response time, the DNR engaged the local government of Sedalia. Captain [then Sergeant] Rice of the police department performed that function until June of 1985. Rice was instructed in the use of the scentometer, made response to local complaints of odors, and maintained a log of those events. In the course of that two-year duty, Rice compiled 23 memoranda of complaint investigations made by citizens in the environs of odors and resultant physical discomforts. These investigations, conducted night or day as the complaints were received, all led to the Alcolac operations. The odors were palpable to Rice, variously, as \"similar to rotten eggs,\" \"sewer odor,\" similar to \"a hair permanent solution,\" and \"foul odor of natural gas\" - among other descriptions. The sources of these odors - except for a chemical spill - were the Alcolac bioponds, and most frequently, biopond one. The scentometer measured the odors on several occasions at the ratio of 31 to 1, and on one occasion, at the ratio of 171 to 1. On these occasions, the Alcolac supervisory personnel attributed the odors to a lack of fresh water in the ponds, the hurried release of soap byproducts, and inability to induce a breakdown of the residue from the production. Of the 23 complaints Rice investigated from June of 1983 to June of 1985, 14 were \"excess emissions\" as defined by regulation, and hence equivalent to violations unless excused.\n\nAlcolac plant chemist Richardson explained that the natural system employed to degrade the compounds in the bioponds emits a \"sulphur-type of odor.\" The odors are more recurrent in the early springtime when an \"inversion occurs\" - when the bacteria become more active and stir from the bottom of the pond to the top. It is a phenomenon which occurs about ten times a year, and sometimes the resultant foam is blown beyond the Alcolac premises. The chemist acknowledged that the ponds are not tested for toxic chemicals. [Nor, as Nikkila testified, was such a test ever undertaken by the DNR.]\n\nJoseph Aid, a plant manager at Alcolac, acknowledged that the odors Captain Rice [investigator under DNR auspices] detected in June of 1983 in response to complaints were \"ery definitely from the bioponds.\" He attributed them, as well as the foam - as did chemist Richardson - to the soap component of the wastewater and to the natural process of bio-oxidation employed to degrade that waste. He acknowledged at the trial [in late 1985]: \"here are still some odor and some foam problems, yes.\"\n\nIn July of 1980, some months after WAPORA was discharged from the Sedalia project in December of 1979, and within weeks of the execution of the abatement agreement on May 30, 1980, Alcolac employed Mark Blowers as environmental engineer - the first to occupy that position. Blowers, a recent graduate school environmental engineering laureate, was then 26 years of age and Alcolac was his first employment as environmental engineer in a chemical plant. He remained with Alcolac for two years - until June of 1982. His responsibility centered around the environmental control building. Blowers replaced an environmental control technician, McCutcheon - a college graduate, but without other qualification in environmental control matters. His duty was also \"to keep an eye on the environmental control building and make sure everything was going okay down there.\" Blowers acknowledged that Joseph LeMaire, the maintenance worker, had served as environmental control technician, but then was returned to maintenance work.\n\nIt befell Blowers to serve as plant liaison with governmental agencies, such as the DNR and the EPA, and hence to implement the abatement agreement concluded between Alcolac and the DNR just the month before. To that end, Blowers undertook to establish procedures for spill control and clean-up. He also undertook to establish procedures for the treatment and storage of hazardous waste so as to comply with the provisions of the federal Resource Conservation Recovery Act , then coming into effect. Blowers was also the official designated to respond to citizen complaints of Alcolac emissions. In those roles, Blowers was in frequent communication with Nikkila and other officials of the DNR. It had been the procedure to maintain the record of spills in the daily reports of the foreman - entries interspersed with other notations on plant operations. Blowers collated these spill notations from the daily reports into a log \"strictly for spills\" and maintained that system from December of 1980 through December of 1981. Thereafter - for no explained reason - the log was discontinued.\n\nThe log reported 111 spills during that year of December, 1980 to December, 1981. The quantity of the spills, as recorded in the log, ranged from one quart to 2900 gallons of the particular compound. Blowers surmised that during the two years he served with Alcolac at Sedalia, \"an environmental concern-type spill, major spill, would once a month.\" The small chemical spills in the environmental control building were rinsed down the drain into the sump pit, and small spills in the monomer building were treated with 3M absorbent cloth. That special cloth functioned to absorb the organic matter from the surface of the waste, and the cloth was then disposed of in drums and discarded as solid waste. Blowers acknowledged that there were occasions when the employees neglected these clean-up procedures, and hence the carbon filter systems were bypassed, so that the spills went directly into biopond one - still untreated and toxic. On other occasions the sumps in the environmental control building operated \"in a bypass mode\" and diverted the chemical waste into the biopond without filtration. Leaky drums were also a source of chemical spills. These fifty-five gallon metal drums, used to store toxic wastes and stacked on the grounds, were sometimes eaten through so that the liquid exuded. They were also struck by trucks and severely damaged so as also to become \"leakers.\"\n\nAnother objective of the abatement agreement Blowers was engaged to implement was that Alcolac install a system of alkaline scrubbers to remove the acrylates from the liquid as well as gaseous waste streams from the monomer reactors. The purpose of the scrubbers was to expunge those toxic residues, as well as their odors, from vapors and liquids before they were vented to the carbon bed and fume incinerator. Alcolac had operated without such scrubbers for the two years which anteceded the abatement agreement. They were installed during his tenure as environmental control engineer, and once in operation - as Blowers described it - they \"worked fairly well most of the time.\" \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e8\u003c/span\u003e\n\nAnother objective of the abatement agreement - the installation of the hydrocarbon monitor on the fume incinerator and carbon bed stacks of the monomer building - was also undertaken during his tenure at Alcolac. The monitor broke down occasionally, but even when the device operated [Blowers said], there was a \"major problem trying to determine a meaning to the data from the hydrocarbon analyzer.\" The monitor measured carbon atoms, rather than specific molecules. Thus, although the monitor could identify the carbon content of an organic emission, it could not identify the particular compound emitted. For instance: the detection of four carbon atoms in the emission could signify the presence of epichlorohydrin or any other compound of similar molecular structure, but could not identify which one. It was a delineated objective [3] of the abatement agreement of May 30, 1980, that Alcolac install by February 1, 1981, a system to determine the \"nature and concentration of the emissions from the stacks of the vapor incinerator and carbon adsorption system for each product manufactured by Alcolac in the monomer building.\" That system was never installed.\n\nBlowers also dealt with the complaints of citizens and of officials concerning the Alcolac operations. The recurrent complaints were of odors and foam from the bioponds. He estimated two dozen such reports during the two years with Alcolac. He explained that the emission of the soap material into the bioponds was an incident of the normal operation of the surfactant plant. The foam - as other Alcolac witnesses also undertook to explain - was the result of the aerator action, and so was not an unexpected occurrence. The foam on occasion built up to a height of 15 to 20 feet on the pond, and when the wind rose, \"bl all about.\" He recalled that on about two occasions, he saw the foam on the property of Alcolac neighbors. The foam came into contact with Blowers and other employees at times, but never with deleterious effect - Blowers testified. He acknowledged, however, that during his tenure the bioponds were never tested for toxicity, so he could not say whether they were contaminated.\n\nIn addition to the continued malfunction of certain pollution control equipment [such as the liquid incinerator at the monomer plant and the acid scrubber at the surfactant plant], the recurrence of chemical spills, and complaints of odors and foam from the bioponds, Blowers encountered two episodes of rupture of the reactor in the monomer plant during his two-year tenure at Alcolac. They involved the blow-out of the rupture disk - a sort of safety release to relieve against excess pressure generated in the reactor tanks during the chemical production process. The rupture disk is a cartridge insert between the reactor and pipeline vent. It is the theory of design that when the pressure in the reactor becomes excessive, the cartridge ruptures and releases the excess gas into the atmosphere through the pipeline. In the early morning of September 25, 1981, a rupture disk blew out, but instead of gas vented into the atmosphere through the pipe, the explosion [as Blowers reported the incident to the DNR], \"took the pipe with it and also damaged building.\" The report identified the chemical component in the reactor at the time of the incident as diallyl maleate and described that compound as \"a mild eye irritant . . . toxic only through ingestion.\" Blowers continued to reassure the DNR that there was \"no reason to expect toxic effect\" from the spewed debris. The city officials evacuated the neighbors in the path of the wind direction and the Sedalia Fire Department was called to the site.\n\nThe investigation established that the rupture disk blowout not only \"took pipe with it\" - as described by the Alcolac report - but also a portion of the monomer plant roof as well. Nor was the debris from the explosion confined to the Alcolac premises, but rather was strewn to the north and south onto private property. A number of the firefighters who responded to the call reported skin irritation, and another fell sick. The diallyl maleate in production at the time of the explosion, Alcolac disclosed, was being made from allyl alcohol and maleic anhydride. Blowers acknowledged that allyl alcohol was toxic and could cause severe irritation to the body and if absorbed through the skin, could cause injury or death. The symptoms displayed by the firemen, the DNR investigation established, \"matched the toxicological information given by the doctor.\"\n\nAt the time of the explosion of September 25, 1981 Alcolac was without a plant manager. Sutton was gone and Aid, his successor, had not yet arrived. Aid came to Alcolac on October 19, 1981 - a month after the explosion. This suit against Alcolac had been commenced by then and pended. Among his first initiatives, Aid addressed a memorandum to the supervisors and lead operators of the Sedalia operation concerning the reporting of spills:\n\nI want to emphasize the importance of reporting all spills at the time they occur. Our liquid waste treatment system only has limited flexibility, and slugs of material create serious problems. . . . If a spill occurs, you must be made aware of it by your operators and a report must be made.\n\nNotwithstanding the hortation of that official memorandum, it was the testimony of lead operator Buckner that spills occurred in the monomer building virtually every day, many of them unreported. The workers found it more convenient to \"wash it down than fill out the paperwork.\" The clean-up procedures were also discouraged as too costly. The prescribed method for the disposal of most spills was absorption by organic [3M] cloth - but \"supervisors complain it was too expensive and too costly and it was just kind of pushed over.\" It became the practice, rather, to wash the spills into the drain the environmental control building. That occasionally caused the environmental control building sumps to overflow with the consequence that the spills liquid was coursed around the filtration system and, still toxic, was pumped directly into biopond one.\n\nBuckner came to Alcolac in September of 1980 and remained there for three years - until September of 1983. Thus, much of his tenure coincided with that of environmental control engineer Blowers. Buckner worked exclusively in the monomer building, where the toxic chemicals were used in production. They included epichlorohydrin, allyl alcohol, methylene chloride, dimethyl sulfate and methyl chloride. He was given no formal training in the use of chemicals, but learned as he went. [Epichlorohydrin, he learned, had no odor and is invisible. \"It is just there and it burns you.\"] Buckner - as did Blowers - confirmed that the foam in biopond one often reached a height of fifteen feet. Buckner - in contradiction of Blowers - related ten to twelve as the number of rupture disk blowout incidents in the monomer building during his employment there. It was also the practice, Buckner testified, to complete the run of a \"batch\" of chemicals before the break of daylight so that the toxic vapors generated from that production process could be vented during the dark \"so nobody could see it.\" There was the testimony of another chemical operator at the monomer plant - called as a witness by Alcolac - Charles Henderson, who had been employed continuously since production began at Sedalia. He testified to occasional spills in the monomer building - and described a \"spill\" as \"something that would take manpower and maybe, you know, two or three hours to rectify.\" Anything less, he considered a \"leak.\" A leak occurred two or three times a week, and was absorbed by 3M paper or simply washed into the drain. A spill occurred very infrequently - two or three times during his eight-year tenure. They occurred outside the building, and were promptly washed down into the drain connected to the environmental control building. Henderson could not estimate, however, the number of toxic spills of lesser magnitude than those which required several persons to \"get it cleaned up rapidly.\" The witness considered the 111 spills reported in the 1981 log maintained by Blowers sounded \"awfully high but . . . possible.\" He acknowledged that during those eight years of employment at Alcolac, he had never been shown the environmental control systems operating manual prepared for the Sedalia plant by WAPORA. He had responded to counsel that he suffered from no Alcolac-related health problems, but acknowledged a recent medical examination report which disclosed complaints of numbness or tingling of the hands and feet. The witness conceded an interest in the outcome of the suit in which he gave testimony: \"It means my job if they lose.\"\n\nThere was other testimony - through Alcolac witnesses - as to the operation and maintenance of the environmental controls at the Sedalia plant. That evidence was interstitial of the proofs already described and undertook to confirm the defense theme that the internal environmental control procedures were methodically observed and were effective to meet official standards. The responses to cross-examination raised some inferences of contradiction. This spate of testimony, for the most part, related to fragments of the span during which Alcolac operated.\n\nRichardson was plant chemist at the Sedalia Alcolac for five years [from 1980]. He had worked for the Alcolac corporation for twenty years altogether, and suffered no significant health problem as a result of that employment. He worked with monomers in the laboratory, in safety garb. It was his testimony that the odors perceptible in the plant - \"sulphur-type\" - were not from the chemicals, but from the bioponds, and were the natural incident of the biodegradation process. The foam on the ponds was a product of the soap plant, and not of toxic chemicals. Cross-examination elicited that neither Richardson as plant chemist nor any other employee ever sampled the ponds for toxic chemicals during his stint with Alcolac. He acknowledged that laboratory tests in 1984 disclosed that he had developed a physical condition of abnormal globulins, and that in 1985 abnormal hemoglobin was detected. Richardson conceded \"an interest in the outcome of this lawsuit to the extent that would like to see Alcolac win the case.\"\n\nLloyd Goode was the environmental control operator during virtually the entire span of the Alcolac operation in Sedalia. His employment progressed from maintenance, to the surfactant plant, to environmental control building as operator. This progression of duty was without any training. It was his function to run tests and otherwise \"take care of the bio-oxidation ponds.\" He testified that there were fish in the ponds and other animal life frequented them. He acknowledged on cross-examination that the tests he conducted for the ponds did not include any for toxic chemicals. He, too, admitted an interest that Alcolac win the litigation.\n\nJames Wells, a DNR supervisor, performed a hazardous waste management compliance and complaint inspection. Wells testified to an inspection of the Missouri Pacific Railroad installation located somewhat to the south and west of Alcolac. The inspection, conducted on May 31, 1985, was to determine compliance with federal and state hazardous waste management laws and regulations. Missouri Pacific was registered with the federal EPA as a hazardous waste generator, but not with the state DNR. The inspection identified several potentially hazardous wastes and resulted in a notice of violation for the generation and disposal of such wastes without registration with the state DNR. Wells acknowledged that the DNR had received no complaint of any Missouri Pacific activity, and further, that the tests conducted on those premises had not yet been reported. Wells also had occasion to be on the Alcolac premises - both for routine hazardous waste management inspections to determine compliance with the newly enacted federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act as well as in response to citizen complaints. The inspections for RCRA compliance were confined to the management and storage of toxic wastes, and did not relate to the condition of the bioponds or emissions from the production process. Wells conducted three such inspections at Alcolac, between June of 1981 and June of 1985. Each of the inspections noted some unsatisfactory feature - among them, the lack of documentation that \"personnel training conducted annually\" and the storage of corrosive waste in damaged containers. The inspections, nevertheless, found Alcolac in substantial compliance with the RCRA. Wells also dealt with air pollution control at the DNR and responded to six citizens complaints about air pollution - odors and foam - from the Alcolac operations.\n\nRaymond was another DNR official - the chief of technical support of the air pollution control program. It was the function of the technical support group to collect information and surveys from Missouri plants which generate air contaminants and, on the basis of the information furnished by the company, to calculate an \"emission inventory\" for that particular plant.\n\nOn the basis of the information furnished by the respective companies, DNR calculated that for year 1983 Alcolac generated two tons of emissions of total hydrocarbons compared with twenty-nine tons of emissions of such compounds generated by the Missouri Pacific Railroad yards nearby. The saliency of that evidence, as the inquiry itself suggests, was to demonstrate the \"efficiency of [the Alcolac] control devices.\" The function of the inventory, as the witness repeated with emphasis, was not to \"evaluate companies,\" but to develop a \"monitoring network major companies,\" but to develop a \"monitoring network major areas of high concentration of pollutants.\" That national data base, under the aegis of the federal Environmental Protection Agency, depends altogether upon what information the particular company chooses to disclose. The concern compounds, and not to total hydrocarbons, as such. The production processes at Alcolac, the DNR witness acknowledged, generated volatile organic compound emissions. The \"emission inventory\" of volatile organic compounds for year 1983 did not list Alcolac, the witness agreed, because \"Alcolac did not choose to send any written information about any volatile organic compounds.\" Hughie Clay came to Sedalia in April of 1985 as plant maintenance engineer at Alcolac. Suit then pended and at the time Clay testified, he had worked at Alcolac for seven months. His work function was to maintain the plant installation and attend to upkeep and repairs. Clay performed no significant duty. Blowers had since left Alcolac, and the plant operated without an environmental control engineer during the period Clay was employed there. The environmental responsibility, rather, reposed in plant manager Aid. The description given by Clay of the production and environmental control processes during his brief span at Alcolac depicted a plant of sophisticated design and virtually flawless operation. Cross-examination elicited, however, the incidence of two fires in the monomer building during his seven-month span of employment. He acknowledged also that he was not informed about past systems malfunction at the plant, and that even the most perfectly designed safety feature could be rendered irrelevant if bypassed.\n\nD.\n\n1.\n\nOpinion for the Plaintiffs\n\nThe Alcolac Operation: Opinions of the Experts\n\nThe plaintiff presented Frederick W. Boelter, industrial engineer and staff expert on industrial hygiene with Carnow-Connibear Associates, \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e9\u003c/span\u003e for his opinion on the safeness of the Alcolac operations to the residents of the environs. His opinion rested on numerous evidentiary sources, among them: the WAPORA document; schematic designs of the facility; observations of the physical Alcolac facility; air and water tests conducted on and near the plant premises; analysis of the plant production documents for the past seven years [1978 to 1985]; analysis of the raw materials, production processes and intermediate chemical products; official documents and memoranda between the Missouri Department of Natural Resources; and the internal records of Alcolac. To derive opinion, the witness interrelated the evidence from these sources to the environmental control practices described by the several Alcolac employee witnesses.\n\nBoelter gave opinion that, despite the state of the art design of the environmental controls installed at Alcolac, the neglect of these procedures by the employees as well as the malfunction of the control equipment, has resulted from 1978 in an operation that has not been safe to residents in the environs from exposure to toxic chemicals and compounds.\n\nBoelter elaborated: the lack of trained personnel, the practice of the Alcolac employees to use the bypass equipment to route the monomer toxic liquid waste stream around the filter system so as to discharge directly into biopond one, the practice of the employees to discharge the surfactant liquid waste stream into biopond one [instead of biopond two as the design intended] so that the toxic waste intermixed with the soap waste with the resultant risk that the toxic compound would be borne into the atmosphere, the failure to control emissions inside the buildings and allow the vapors to vent into the atmosphere through open doors, the want of a valid spill control program, the falsification of records, the lack of a standard operating procedure - all bespoke a management \"terribly lax in addressing basic plant operation requirements\" and were contrary to industry standards.\n\nBoelter also related his opinion of unsafe operation to the log of chemical spills kept for the year 1981 by Blowers during his service at Alcolac as environmental control engineer. The log recorded 111 spills - among them quantities of such extremely toxic chemicals as epichloroydrin, allyl alcohol and allyl methacrylate. The log explained the cause for each recorded spill, and a number of them - as interpreted by Boelter - were the result of a want of standard operating procedure, employee neglect and equipment leaks.\n\nBoelter also determined from the history of equipment malfunction and misuse, that Alcolac was from inception in 1978 and operation unsafe to nearby residents. The incinerator designed as the environmental control for the disposal of the hazardous liquid waste from the monomer process never functioned properly, and was abandoned in 1981. In that interim, the malfunction frequently resulted in incomplete combustion of the waste and hence emission of that, and other, toxic residue into the atmosphere. The fume incinerator used for the combustion of the vapor wastes in the monomer building also did not always function so that toxic in the surfactant building often did not function with the consequence that the bioponds were further stressed by the additional soap and their normal biogradation function impaired. When the acid scrubber malfunctioned, also, sulphur dioxide, sulphur trioxide and sodium hydroxide - all regulated by law as pollutants - were emitted in the form of a plume of dark smoke. Boelter also rested opinion on the recurrent overload of the bioponds with much higher quantities of organic wastes from the monomer building than the design contemplated [noted by WAPORA as early as 1978], with the consequence that the biodegradation of the chemical wastewater was impaired. These chemicals as well as the surfactant deposits from the faulty acid scrubbers, the evidentiary sources disclosed, produced odors which were never altogether dispelled by the installation of aerators in the bioponds and the use of ammonium nitrate. These sources of evidence also disclosed to Boelter that the bioponds were never monitored for toxicity either of the liquids or vapors.\n\nBoelter rested his opinion that Alcolac was an operation not safe to the nearby residents on yet another ground: the lack of detectors on the stacks and carbon beds to monitor on a \"product-to-product\" basis to identify the precise hydrocarbon compound -- and its toxicity -- being emitted from the production of the particular monomer batch. It was a recommendation made early by WAPORA, but rejected by Alcolac as too costly. It was later a subject of the abatement agreement with the DNR in 1980, but never implemented by Alcolac. The documents Boelter reviewed disclosed also that the carbon adsorption systems, both in the monomer building for the vapor wastes and in the environmental control building for the vapor wastes, were allowed to become over-saturated so that the excess wastes simply passed through \"as though there were no device in place at all.\"\n\nThe opinion also rested on three tests conducted by Boelter and the Carnow-Connibear Associates on and around the Alcolac premises.\n\nThe first was conducted on September 12 through September 14, 1983 at residences of several plaintiffs around the plant. Air samples were taken at those sites for lead, sulfates, methanol and other organic compounds. They determined that Alcolac contributed to the level of sulfates, but were inconclusive as to methanol and the other compounds. Boelter explained that the testers had no real knowledge as to what was in the process of manufacture on those days, therefore the sampling was \"essentially blind.\"\n\nThe second survey was conducted on September 4 through September 7, 1984, and involved both air and water tests. The water at the residences of six of the plaintiffs was tested, as was the ambient air, to determine any detectable level of six specific toxic compounds. The tests of the samples disclosed no significant concentration of any of those six contaminants. Boelter explained that on the days of the tests, the plant was \"not operating in a way to determine the level of activity and again, the compounds that were used and what was being manufactured at the time was unknown to us.\"\n\nThe third survey was conducted on June 22, 1985, on the Alcolac premises under the auspices of a court order. There was no plant activity on that day, and hence air samples, Boelter explained, would have been of no use. [The Alcolac records for that day and the several days before indicate that the reactors were in the process of restoration and otherwise inactive.] Water samples were taken from bioponds one and two. Toluene, a toxic compound, was found in a concentration of 240 parts per billion, as well as other compounds, one known as two-three dichloropropene and another called three-three oxybispropene. The significance of the presence of toluene [although in relatively low concentration], Boelter explained, is that that toxic compound is very volatile and so indicates a more massive recent presence. The significance of two-three dichloropropene is as a \"footprint\" for epichlorohydrin, a very toxic compound. The chloropropenes, Boelter explained, are a degradation product of epichlorohydrin and indicate that epichlorohydrin was present. Boelter explained further that it is impossible to sample directly for epichlorohydrin in water since it is so volatile. \"It has a very short half life in water\" and disappears very quickly either by evaporation into the air or by decomposition into other products such as dichloropropene. Propene [also known as allyl ether], a toxic organic compound also found n the bioponds water samples, is formed from the reaction between allyl alcohol and sulfuric acid -- chemicals used in the Alcolac production process. The tests detected another toxic compound in the bioponds waters -- a nitrosamine called N-nitrosomorphyoline, the result of the heavy use of ammonium nitrate in the bioponds to dissipate the odors. The detection of the presence of the morpholine compounds is significant, Boelter explained, because they are associated with the manufacture of cosmetic chemicals -- the production of the surfactant plant.\n\nBoelter concluded that the presence of these organic compounds in the bioponds was \"of particular concern\" because the samples were taken under conditions much more favorable than \"historical conditions,\" \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e10\u003c/span\u003e and if what was found was nay indication \"the conditions historically were more than likely much worse than this and with the difficulty in controlling the ponds and the foam that is generated, this could be a very significant contribution to the effects on the surrounding environment.\" Boelter observed that only in the chemical and industrial plants of \"third world countries\" had he seen \"this bad of a situation in one place.\"\n\n2.\n\nOpinion for Alcolac\n\nAlcolac presented the deposition testimony of Robert B. Jacko, Ph.D., expert in environmental engineering and faculty member of the Purdue School of Civil Engineering. The witness also had conducted research in the flow of toxic pollutants in chemical and other facilities, but that inquiry did not include health studies.\n\nDr. Jacko made three visits to the Alcolac facility. The first two were in the autumn of 1984, and the third was on June 22, 1985, the same date the Carnow-Connibear Associates conducted tests on the Alcolac premises. In preparation for these visits, Jacko was furnished with numerous documents and other information -- which included the environmental study conducted by the Carnow-Connibear Associates off-premises in the vicinity of the Alcolac plant. Jacko was also furnished the specifications of \"all the environmental control systems at Alcolac, as modified by Alcolac employees to update them.\" It was on the basis of that information as well as his observations and over-flights of the facility that the Jacko testimony and opinions are based.\n\nIt was the opinion of expert Jacko that Alcolac functioned as a closed system for the containment of volatile and organic vapors. That is to say, the environmental control devices operated so that the vapors were not released into the atmosphere until the organic matter had been expunged. In the warehouse building, in case of a chemical spill, the building was completely sealed and the fans carried the vapors to the carbon beds for adsorption. In the monomer building, a system of ducts captured the vapors and conducted them to the carbon beds for adsorption, and the vapors are then emitted through the fume incinerator. In the surfactant building, one acid scrubber removes the sulphur dioxide and sulfur trioxide before the vapors are emitted through the stacks, and the other, the solid particulate matter. The emissions from this operation, the witness testified, conformed to the EPA standards. In the environmental control building, the vapors from the monomer liquid collected in the sumps ran through a carbon adsorption system, then through the caustic scrubbers, \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e11\u003c/span\u003e into the fume incinerator, and then emitted into the atmosphere.\n\nJacko conducted no tests, either of the ambient air or of the bioponds. He \"walked the ponds\" with Boelter on the June 22, 1985 occasion, but \"perceive no significant odors at that time.\" Jacko mentioned two monitors of the bioponds, one to measure biological oxygen demand, and the other to measure dissolved oxygen. He noted no Alcolac procedure or practice to test the bioponds for toxicity. The witness alluded to a sulfur emission test conducted on June 20, 1984 by the Shell Engineering Associates on behalf of Alcolac. The test was for both sulfates and sulfur dioxide, as required by the abatement agreement with the DNR, and certified that the emission rates of both samples were in concentrations lower than the maximum allowed limits. The witness also alluded to the extensive forms submitted by Alcolac for air pollution permits then issued by official agency, presumably as evidence of valid environmental practices.\n\nJacko mentioned no adverse environmental consequence from the past acknowledged malfunctions of the environmental control system as \"updated\" -- as of the acid scrubbers in the surfactant building and the hydrocarbon monitor installed under the abatement agreement. It is evident that the deposition opinion Jacko rendered -- that Alcolac functioned as a closed environmental system as to volatile or organic vapors -- was essentially an appraisal of conditions observed in 1984 and 1985.\n\nAlcolac also presented the testimony of Harvey Shell, chemical engineer and president of Shell Engineering and Associates. Shell Engineering conducted a test of the surfactant stacks at Alcolac on June 20, 1984, and of the monomer fume incinerator stack on June 26, 1984. The surfactant test was undertaken to comply with the term of the abatement agreement that Alcolac would test the surfactant stack semi-annually for emissions of sulfur dioxide and sulfur trioxide acid mist. The surfactant tests certified that the emission rates were in concentrations less than the maximum allowed by regulation. Shell acknowledged that the test was for total hydrocarbons, and not for emissions of specific organic compounds. Hence, what the emissions were, or if they were toxic, were not determinable by the test.\n\nShell took no test of the bioponds for toxicity, nor of the foam. Nevertheless, he disagreed with the Conclusions of the Carnow-Connibear test that the quantity of toluene measured in the bioponds was a significant source of toxic emission. He concluded, rather, that \"the ponds are working and doing what they are supposed to do.\"\n\nHe rendered the opinion -- based upon reports submitted by Missouri Pacific to the DNR that it generates twenty-nine tons of emissions per year in total hydrocarbons and in volatile organic compounds -- that the Missouri Pacific operation contributed to the ambient emissions in the area of Alcolac. Shell acknowledged he had undertaken no tests of Missouri Pacific emissions.\n\nIII\n\nThe Chemicals\n\nAlcolac produced surfactant and monomers. The surfactant production, for the most part soaps, was a continuous operation. The chemical ingredients as well as the wastes, accordingly, were constant. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e12\u003c/span\u003e The monomer production, on the other hand, was custom designed to the needs of the customer, and production depended upon demand. The chemical ingredients of the monomers, therefore, varied according to the order. Many of these chemicals were toxic -- as were their wastes. Of these, some were rated as hazardous by the Environmental Protection Agency. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e13\u003c/span\u003e Others of the many chemicals used in the monomer production may have been more toxic and hazardous than those identified in the testimony, but have never been tested for toxicity, so that the effects of these agents on the biological system are not known. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e14\u003c/span\u003e\n\nAmong the chemicals regularly used by Alcolac in the monomer production process, and already tested for toxic effects, were epichlorohydrin, allyl alcohol, ethyl acrylate, toluene, glycidyl ether and cyclohexene. Of these six chemicals [Dr. Legator testified], \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e15\u003c/span\u003e five are designated as hazardous by the EPA, and three are known carcinogens. The effect of a toxic chemical on the human body, Dr. Legator explained, depends upon the concentration of the chemical and duration of the exposure to it. Or, as rendered into a formula: \"Concentration times time equals effect.\" That equation is subject to variables -- among them, the genetic susceptibility of the person to chemicals and the mode of life adopted by the person. The exposure may be chronic -- over a prolonged time, or acute -- over a short time. The toxic effects may also manifest as chronic or acute. There are diverse portals through which the toxic chemicals gain access to the body. The major routes are through the skin, the mouth or lungs. A toxic chemical may characteristically attack a particular organ or may target multiple organs. When absorbed, toxic chemicals can affect the immune system and, if the dose is high and prolonged enough, can cause mutations in the human body.\n\nWhere the exposures are from multiple toxicants [as in the monomer production process], Dr. Legator explained, the combined toxic effects from the interaction may be much greater than the mathematical sum of their individual effects. As toxicologist Schwartz \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e16\u003c/span\u003e commented, science recognizes chemical interactions where \"one and one equal ten.\" That effect is known by the technical term synergism. Another means whereby toxic chemicals may become more toxic is by the process of pyrolysis. That term means merely breakdown by heat. Incineration was the form of pyrolysis used by Alcolac to dispose of some toxic wastes. If the incineration is at a heat effective to destroy the chemicals [Dr. Legator explained], the toxic effects are also destroyed. If the incineration is incomplete so that the chemicals are only partially destroyed, the pyrolysis may result in more toxic chemicals than originally and \"produce more chemical in the atmosphere.\" Dr. Legator gave as opinion -- in terms of pyrolysis -- that the effect of the operation by Alcolac of the liquid incinerator at low heat levels because of continued malfunction was the discharged of more toxic substances. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e17\u003c/span\u003e\n\nDr. Legator then discussed the toxicological role of each of the six chemicals used in the monomer production process at Alcolac and already tested for toxic effect:\n\nEPICHLOROHYDRIN\n\nAlcolac used some 378,000 pounds of epichlorohydrin per year. It is listed by the EPA as a direct carcinogen, a hazardous substance, and a hazardous waste. It is a volatile chemical and enters the human system through inhalation and also the skin. The target organs are the brain and the central nervous system, as well as the kidney and liver, among others. It affects the blood and causes porphyria -- a disease of liver metabolism. The chemical is also a mutagen and induces \"transmissible genetic damage.\" It has also been identified as the cause, even at \"very low concentrations,\" of chromosome damage in humans -- that is, to \"he package that holds our DNA.\" That is significant, Dr. Legator explained, because \"literally every chemical that I know of that causes chromosomal damage also causes cancer.\" It is an identification of cause, moreover, borne out by epidemiological studies. Animal studies confirm that epichlorohydrin causes a variety of cancers in different organ sites, breaks down the chromosomes, and affects the reproductive system.\n\nDr. Bertram Carnow, another expert in toxicology and other sciences, \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e18\u003c/span\u003e described epichlorohydrin as a direct carcinogen -- \"an extraordinarily active chemical,\" a \"grabber\" which \"grabs onto DNA\" and changes it. The chemical also deforms the immune system so that it cannot respond to the attacks on the DNA by cancer cells. Dr. Carnow confirmed that the indication of an earlier epidemiological study that exposure to epichlorohydrin presents a risk of cancer to humans has been \"more strongly proven.\" The witness considered it significant that Alcolac has used an average of 378,000 pounds of the chemical in each of the past seven years, since even \"n very small quantities, it is extraordinarily toxic.\" The volatility of the chemical, moreover, is such that if \"put out into water, t will go from water into air.\" A test of Alcolac bioponds one by the Carnow professional group found \"the footprints of epichlorohydrin\" in the waters.\n\nThe toxicologist for Alcolac, Dr. Sorrell Schwartz, agreed that epichlorohydrin can cause damage to multiple organ systems -- the liver, the lung, the kidney and other sites. He would not acknowledge it as a \"foregone Conclusion,\" however, that the compound can cause porphyria, but considered it \"certainly plausible,\" since the chemical \"does have a fairly extensive ability to interact with the systems, with the liver.\" The witness agreed that epichlorohydrin, as an alkylating agent, is a \"cell-killer,\" but maintained that it has not been demonstrated that the chemical depresses the immune system in humans. Dr. Schwartz agreed that chronic effects may result from exposure to epichlorohydrin in adequate doses and that the chemical is a proven animal carcinogen. He concluded: \"It is possible that it can cause it in humans.\" Indeed, it was the opinion of Dr. Arthur C. Zahalsky, presented as an expert on immunology by the plaintiffs, that epichlorohydrin is not only a carcinogen, but acts adversely on the human immune system.\n\nThe opinions of Dr. Edward Anthony Emmett, another expert witness for Alcolac, \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e19\u003c/span\u003e were somewhat at variance with those given by Alcolac toxicologist, Dr. Schwartz, as to the toxic effects of epichlorohydrin. Dr. Emmett acknowledged that recent publications conclude that exposure to epichlorohydrin presents a risk of cancer to humans. He agreed with the other witnesses that epichlorohydrin, as an alkylating agent, is \"dangerous and powerfully reactive to chemicals\" and \"combines avidly with tissue.\" The witness deemed it \"certainly possible\" that exposure to such a chemical could \"depress and destroy the immune system\" in humans. Dr. Emmett testified that toxic chemicals cause a form of porphyria called toxic porphyria. He intimated that epichlorohydrin can cause that species of porphyria.\n\nThe material safety data sheet \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e20\u003c/span\u003e issued by Alcolac to the work personnel in compliance with OSHA directive informs that epichlorohydrin, in liquid form, \"can be fatal if swallowed,\" and \"igh vapor concentrations can cause death.\" It informs also that \"the results of a recent epidemiology study have been termed 'highly suggestive' that exposure to ECH is a cancer risk to humans.\" The data sheet describes as the effects of overexposure: \"Vapors severely irritating to the eyes, nose and throat. Repeated or prolonged exposure can cause severe and lasting lung, liver and kidney damage and change in lymphocytes [cells in blood and lymph] . . . Cancer suspect agent.\" It gives the special precaution: \"notify authorities if any exposure to the general public or environment is threatened by a spill.\"\n\nEpichlorohydrin was among the toxic compounds spewed about from blow-outs of ruptured disks [as reported by monomer operator Buckner and environmental control technician Holman.] It was also a component of the 2900 gallon and other spills recorded in the Blowers log for year 1981.\n\nALLYL ALCOHOL\n\nAlcolac used some 416,000 pounds of allyl alcohol per year. It is listed by the EPA as a hazardous waste. It gains entry into the human system by inhalation and is readily absorbed through the skin. Allyl alcohol can have either a chronic or acute effect on humans, according to the concentration of the exposure. The target organs are the liver and kidneys, among other systems, and exposure may cause necrosis. Allyl alcohol also acts as a enzyme and converts other chemicals in the body into even more toxic substances. It has been demonstrated in vitro to alter genetic composition. It was the opinion of Dr. Emmett, Alcolac environmental occupation medicine and toxicology expert, that exposure to allyl alcohol can cause mutagenic effects in humans.\n\nSpills and emissions of allyl alcohol in the monomer building were reported in the evidence. Environmental control tester Holman described an explosion of a monomer reactor which spewed a combination of allyl alcohol, epichlorohydrin and stannic acid. The toxic spill log maintained by environmental control engineer Blowers records a spill of 2900 gallons og AGE stripped brine -- a fluid composed of allyl alcohol and epichlorohydrin. Monomer and surfactant operator Faulconer described a spill of a quart of allyl alcohol whose vapors were allowed to emit into the atmosphere. Allyl alcohol was also a component of the monomer in production at the time of the explosion of September 25, 1981, which blew off a segment of the factory roof and strewed the debris onto private property. It was an observation of one of the numerous WAPORA reports from Bregman to the alcohol in the monomer production process was a cause of the recurrent odors and posed, as well, an environmental hazard.\n\nThe material safety data sheet circulated by Alcolac to the plant workers to comply with OSHA directives described allyl alcohol as a colorless liquid with a sharp odor. In vapor form, it is \"highly irritating to the eyes, lungs and damaging to the liver and kidneys.\" It warns: \"Onset of eye irritation may be delayed but can be severe . . . Absorption through the intact skin can cause injury or death.\" The sheet concluded with the special precautions: \"Handle as flammable liquid and as a poison . . . Notify authorities if any exposure to the general public or environment is threatened by a spill.\"\n\nETHYL ACRYLATE\n\nAlcolac used some 83,000 pounds of ethyl acrylate per year. It is listed by the EPA as a hazardous waste. It is carcinogenic to animals, but present data does not support the expectation that exposure causes cancer in humans. The compound also affects the reproductive process in animals. Dr. Legator, expert in toxicology for the plaintiffs, gave opinion that ethyl acrylate is a mutagenic. The primary portal of entry is inhalation. The chemical is very odorous and extremely irritating. Ethyl acrylate may cause both acute and chronic effects. It is known to cause convulsions, arrythmias and other strange manifestations of the heart. It also affects the kidneys, heart, lungs, liver and central nervous system.\n\nThe wastes from the monomer production process [as a memorandum by Alcolac vice president Bouroff to president Anderson noted] were \"saturated with acrylates.\" It was to allay that source of pollution that Alcolac was required by the abatement agreement with the DNR to install alkaline scrubbers to remove the acrylates from both the liquid and gaseous waste streams from the monomer building reactors. The pronounced odors of ethyl acrylate from the shift in the monomer carbon bed and spills were the subject of report between Alcolac and the DNR.\n\nTOLUENE\n\nAlcolac used some 17,000 pounds of toluene per year. It is an active compound and enters the human system through inhalation and the skin. The compound attacks the respiratory system, central nervous system, the liver, kidneys and heart. It causes arrythmia, tremors, convulsions and other episodes of that ilk. Its effects can be chronic, and -- according to Alcolac polyexpert Emmett -- presents a \"potential risk of cancer\" in humans. Exposure to the chemical affects reproduction in animals and -- according to an authoritative text -- also affects human fertility. It was opinion of Dr. Zahalsky, immunology expert for plaintiffs, that toluene is toxic to the cells and acts on the immune system. Toluene not only attacks the organ systems of humans, but exposure to the chemical by domestic animals induces a range of effects -- such as convulsions, loss of motor control, and even death.\n\nIt was this chemical, toluene, which -- according to environmental control building technician LeMaire -- on occasions overflowed from the sump pits to the exterior and into Shaver Creek. It was this chemical also which spilled outside in such quantity as to cover the adjacent irrigation pond to a depth of one-half inch. The test of bioponds one by the Carnow professional group which found \"the footprints of epichlorohydrin\" in the waters found toluene also. It was the opinion of toxicologist Legator that spills of toluene and related chemicals exposed to the air evaporate and -- depending upon atmospheric conditions -- \"blow around to the surrounding population.\"\n\nGLYCIDYL ETHER\n\nAlcolac used some 390,000 pounds of glycidyl ether per year. It is a highly reactive chemical and enters the bodily system through inhalation, the skin or through the mouth -- if contained in food or water. Glycidyl ether affects the liver, the kidneys, the respiratory tract and the central nervous system. It causes peripheral neuropathy and manifests in numbness, tingling and leg cramps. Prolonged exposure to the chemical produces chronic effects. Glycidyl ether is known to cause cancer in animals, and, according to Alcolac toxicologist Schwartz, \"is possible\" as a cause of cancer in humans.\n\nToxicologist Legator, in response to a hypothesis posed from the evidence of ninety residents within the Alcolac environs that from 50 to 60% of them experience continuous tingling and numbness of the extremities, equated that incidence with \"walking down the street and seeing seven people who are eight feet tall.\"\n\nCYCLOHEXANE\n\nAlcolac also used cyclohexane in the monomer process. [The evidence does not disclose the quantity.] It is listed as a hazardous waste by the EPA. The portal of entry is inhalation and the target organs are the respiratory and the central nervous systems. It causes erratic blood pressure, sudden nosebleeds, lethargy, depression and vascular disorders.\n\nIn addition to the six chemicals already tested for toxic effect -- epichlorohydrin, allyl alcohol, ethyl acrylate, toluene, glycidyl ether and cyclohexane -- as explained by the testimony of toxicologists Legator, Schwartz, Emmett and Carnow, the Alcolac evidence identified other chemicals, also of known effect, involved in the production process. Among them were dimethyl sulfate, hydrogen sulfide, methyl chloride and allyl methacrylate.\n\nDIMETHYL SULFATE\n\nThat chemical, Alcolac toxicologists Schwartz and Emmett agreed, enters the bodily system through inhalation and the skin. The kidneys, liver, and the central nervous and respiratory systems are the target organs. If the exposure is persistent enough and the dosage sufficient, the effects of the chemical can be chronic. It is a carcinogen in animals and, according to Dr. Emmett, carries risks of cancer to man. Dimethyl sulfate, immunologist Zahalsky explained, is an alkylating agent: it adds new chemical groups into the compound. As in the case of epicholorohydrin [and some of the other chemicals], absorption into the human system operates to alter the DNA and to kill normal cells. In the terminology of immunologist Zahalsky, dimethyl sulfate attaches to cells and induces the genetic code sequence \"to go haywire.\" It was an opinion confirmed by Alcolac immunologist Stechschulte.\n\nThe material safety data sheet circulated by Alcolac to the plant workers to comply with the requirements of OSHA warned: \"Extremely hazardous liquid and vapor. Causes severe burns. Lung injury and burns may be delayed. May cause cancer [based on tests with laboratory animals].\"\n\nHYDROGEN SULFIDE\n\n\"Hydrogen sulfide is deadlier than cyanide,\" Dr. Carnow explained. This compound is absorbed into the bodily system through inhalation and the odor of rotten eggs attend its presence. The odor of rotten eggs was a recurrent emission from the bioponds. The cause of these odors Dr. Carnow attributed to the production of hydrogen sulfide from the overload of the bioponds with toxic chemicals. It was the recurrent rotten egg odor of hydrogen sulfide in the sludge of the overused bioponds that Dr. Reid detected during his tests and examinations for WAPORA. It was also hydrogen sulfide DNR official Nikkila detected during one of his investigations of the bioponds. He attributed that emission to insufficient aerators or to overloaded use.\n\nThe organs affected by exposure to this compound are the liver, the kidneys, the respiratory and central nervous systems. It was the opinion of Alcolac toxicologist Schwartz that hydrogen sulfide produces chronic effects if the dosage is adequate of a prolonged exposure. In such circumstances, damage to the liver could result in damage to the porphyrin metabolism. Mr. Carnow elaborated: In relatively low concentrations, hydrogen sulfide causes dizziness, vomiting and severe headaches. In higher concentrations, it causes brain damage, respiratory paralysis, and death.\n\nMETHYLENE CHLORIDE\n\nIt was a chemical found in the bioponds waters in the tests performed for the plaintiffs by the Carnow professional group. It was among the toxic wastes [according to monomer operator Faulconer] stored in drums, dept along the Alcolac driveway and crushed by truck traffic so that the highly volatile compound was permitted to emit into the atmosphere. It was among the toxic waste remnants, according to Faulconer, Alcolac personnel discarded from tankers before replenishing them. Methylene chloride enters the human system through inhalation and the skin. In a sufficient dose it affects the liver [and hence porphyrin metabolism], the heart, and central nervous and respiratory systems. It was the opinion of Alcolac toxicologist Schwartz that in adequate and prolonged dosage, methylene chloride may cause cancer and mutations in humans and depress the immune system.\n\nHYDROCHLORIC ACID\n\nHydrochloric acid -- according to WAPORA president Bregman, was a product of the misuse of the liquid incinerator in the environmental control building. Inhalation [in vapor form as hydrogen chloride] is the principal portal of entry. The vapor becomes an acid when dissolved in water and in that form burns through the skin. In large enough dosage, Alcolac toxicologist Schwartz explained, hydrochloric acid can cause damage to multiple organs: the respiratory and central nervous systems, the liver, and the kidneys. It was the opinion of Alcolac toxicologist Emmett [in apparent disagreement with Alcolac toxicologist Schwartz] that the compound can induce chronic effects.\n\nALLYL METHACRYLATE\n\nAlcolac produced allyl methacrylate in the monomer process. The material safety data sheet circulated by Alcolac to the workers describes the effects of overexposure: \"Product may be fatal if inhaled, ingested or absorbed through skin. Irritation of eyes, nose, throat; dermatitis; narcosis.\" A spill of 15 gallons of allyl methacrylate was recorded by Blowers in the log on July 29, 1981, from a tank overflow.\n\nThere was evidence [already recounted] that from the virtual onset of the Alcolac operations in 1978, these chemicals or their pyrolysis products were regularly emitted into the atmosphere through the defective liquid incinerator, the vented spills, or discharges -- unfiltered and still toxic -- into the bioponds which mixed with the soap refuse and in that form were borne away into the ambient air. The function of the liquid incinerator, as explained,, was to destroy by heat the organic matter of the toxic chemical waste from the monomer process so that liquid would emerge as wastewater free of contamination and flow into the biopond. When the incinerator malfunctioned, however, the organic matter in the toxic liquid waste remained unconsumed or only partially consumed. When the waste was not consumed, it was emitted into the atmosphere unchanged and still toxic. When the waste was partially consumed, it was emitted as chemical fractions of the toxic waste, often with multiplied toxic effect.\n\nThe remnants of these unconsumed wastes retained in the liquid, and their pyrolysis products, moreover, then flowed into the biopond to mix the toxic wastes periodically pumped around the filtration system and into the biopond. The effect of such a potpourri [in the terminology of Dr. Carnow] was \"a witch's brew,\" a \"chemistry set that is unbelievable extraordinarily active chemicals, alkylating agents, like epichlorohydrin. ou put them all in one place and there is no way of knowing the extraordinary number of toxic agents that you might produce in such a soup.\" It was significant, Dr. Carnow explained, that the chemicals used and emitted in the monomer production process -- epichlorohydrin, allyl alcohol, ethyl acrylate, toluene, glycidyl ether and cyclohexene -- attack common organ systems: the liver, the immune system and the central nervous system. He described the mode and effects of concerted assault:\n\nThey are extremely active. That's why they are so irritating to the eyes, and the nose, because they attack protein . . . They attack and can even coagulate protein, and when they get into the body, they head for organs, and . . . can cause very severe damage, but again in low concentrations, they eat away at an organ. They cause damage, and if you have more than one . . . you may have either what we call an additive effect, that's where one and one is two, or you may have what we call a synergistic effect, and that's where two chemicals have more than an additive effect. That's when two and two is six, or ten, or something like that, and that makes it even worse. You have the worst of all possible situations when you have chronic, recurrent exposure, you have multiple chemicals that are highly reactive, you have multiple portals of entry, and you have these chemicals acting together to attack major organ systems.\n\nIV\n\nResidents in the Environs of Alcolac\n\nA\n\nThe Plaintiffs-Witnesses\n\nAlcolac is located on an industrial site northeast of the Sedalia limits in the midst of land still used for agricultural purposes. The industrial area of Sedalia proper lies to the southwest of Alcolac within the city boundary. The thirty-one plaintiffs, composed of twelve family groups, all resided within one and one-half miles of Alcolac -- most of them much closer. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e21\u003c/span\u003e All but one of the family groups had established residence there before the advent of Alcolac. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e22\u003c/span\u003e The ages of the plaintiffs range from 75 years [Virgil Bradley] to 11 years [Amber Cross]. It was the uniform testimony of all the plaintiffs that the onset of the foul and noxious odors, fumes, smoke, vapors and emissions they experienced coincided with the commencement of operations by Alcolac. Storms of foam from the bioponds were borne onto their land \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e23\u003c/span\u003e and onto Little Shaver Creek and transported throughj other properties. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e24\u003c/span\u003e It was the uniform testimony of the plaintiffs that exposure to these Alcolac emissions caused them symptoms -- most commonly and recurrently -- eye, nose, throat and skin irritations, nausea, vomiting, numbness and tingling of the limbs, heart irregularity, respiratory difficulty, and other afflictions. The odors were described variously but recurrently as those of rotten eggs, sulphur, lacquer, ammonia, of sweetness, and of other familiar scents. It was the uniform testimony of the plaintiffs also that they had experienced no noticeable emissions or impairment of health from the operations of other enterprises in the locale, in place since before the advent of Alcolac. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e25\u003c/span\u003e There were innumerable reports of these annoyances, intrusions and physical effects to Alcolac, the DNR, and governmental officials at every level, but to no avail.\n\nThe frequency and intensity of the atmospheric emissions from Alcolac, these witnesses agreed, depended upon the direction or calm of the wind. There was expert meteorological testimony, derived from statistical observations taken at Whiteman Air Force Base near Sedalia, that the wind blows from the south 12.5 percent of the time, blows from the south-southwest 8.5 percent of the time, from the north 8.5 percent of the time and remains calm [that is, blows at less than 1 mile per hour] 13.5 percent of the time. The wind is light and variable 47% of the time. That latter statistic, the expert concluded, indicated \"a very excellent opportunity for the people in the vicinity of the plant to detect odors a large percentage of the time.\"\n\nThe members of each plaintiff family group testified to the recurrent incidences of exposure to the Alcolac emissions and the physical symptoms they induced, to their life modes and habits, and to other personal data which relate to the expert assessment of the etiology and causation of their complaints of environmental injury. This history data was of the same kind elicited from each of the plaintiffs upon clinical examination and, along with the results of physical examination and laboratory tests, were significant elements in the derivation of environmental medicine diagnoses by their physicians as well as those of Alcolac. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e26\u003c/span\u003e\n\nB\n\nThe Non-Litigant Witnesses\n\n1.\n\nFor the Plaintiffs\n\nThere was testimony, for the plaintiffs, from more than fifty other witnesses, all nonlitigants also resident in the environs, that the Alcolac emissions were causes of annoyance and physical complaint. The locations of their residences ranged from very next to the Alcolac plant to sites more than three miles distant. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e27\u003c/span\u003e Their occupations were as diverse as their ages. The current of that testimony comported with the testimony of the plaintiffs: The Alcolac operations gave off emissions in the form of vapors, odors, smoke, fumes, foam and residues which physically affected their persons. The odors and emissions were persistent and recurred day and night. Black smoke belched from the Alcolac stack even in the early mornings. A white residue covered the grass and other vegetation and was an irritation to the skin and exposed areas of the body. Suds and foam from the Alcolac bioponds alighted on their property, even though several miles distant.\n\nThey [as did the plaintiffs] described the odors as scents of rotten eggs, lacquer, sickening sweetness, ammonia, sulphur -- and the like. They [as did the plaintiffs] described the consequences of exposure to these discharges as irritations to the nose, throat and eyes, matted eyes, redness and watering of the eyes, kidney infections, skin rashes, headaches, cramps and charley horses in the calves and legs, numbness and tingling in the limbs, nausea, fatigue, respiratory difficulty and irregularity of heartbeat. The more youthful females also complained of interrupted and abnormal menstrual cycles. The symptoms, as to most of them, persist. As to several of these nonlitigants who removed from the environs of Alcolac, the symptoms disappeared. They [as did the plaintiffs who kept gardens and animals] complained that the emissions, especially in the form of a white powder residue, afflicted the vegetation so that whole stands of decorative, orchard trees and vegetable plants were stunted. Their domestic animals and pets also died -- and unaccountably and without sign of predation. They included cultivated husbandry such as bee swarms, cattle and chickens as well as domestic pets, such as parakeets, dogs and cats. There was also evidence by a nonplaintiff witness that Little Shaver Creek [which traversed the property], the source of the drinking water for the cattle, was so tainted by foam from Alcolac as to kill the fish and cause the cattle meat to stink and become inedible.\n\nIt was the testimony of these witnesses [as of the plaintiffs] -- a number of whom resided for years adjacent to the Missouri Pacific Railroad yards, Missouri Pressed Metals, DeLong Welding and other plants -- that not until Alcolac commenced operations were any odors or other emissions palpable, and not until Alcolac were any ill effects to their persons or plants and animals experienced. A very few of them noticed an occasional odor from Quality Fiberglass, but it was fleeting and of a different quality. The odors and emissions from Alcolac were distinctive and recurrent. It was the testimony of those among them whose employment brought them onto the Alcolac premises for periods of time -- such as construction workers -- that the odors and emissions they detected from their residences were of the same kind they experienced while in the Alcolac plant. It was the testimony of all these nonlitigant witnesses that their symptoms, complaints and changes of health came on after the Alcolac operations began in May of 1978, and not experienced before.\n\nThe nonlitigant witnesses for the plaintiffs also included public officials, some of whom lived within the environs and others who did not, but all of whom frequently -- even repeatedly -- were called to the vicinity of Alcolac and onto the premises, day and night, in response to citizen complains of odors and other emissions. The experiences of emissions from Alcolac and the symptoms from those exposures were congruent with those described by the plaintiff witnesses as well as the other nonlitigant witnesses for the plaintiffs. Odors were emitted, smoke from the stack, dense haze, and suds and foam from the bioponds. The odors were described, variously, as \"intense,\" \"terrific,\" \"bad\" -- of the sulphur type, of rotten eggs, septic or paint thinner. The odors were the same off the Alcolac premises as they had detected in the plant, and were noticeable from several miles away. The foam and suds from the bioponds came in profusion -- a phenomenon Senator Mathewson described as: \"ike Lawrence Welk had turned loose the bubble machine.\" The vapors sometimes emitted as \"a very fine mist\" and burned exposed skin. County Court member Jones described the effects to exposure as irritated and watery eyes and headaches. Sgt. Rice of the Sedalia police department [designated by the DNR to respond to citizen complaints] experienced irritation to the mucous membrane from exposure to the Alcolac emissions, as well as irritation to the nose and throat, watering eyes and upset stomach. Environmental Quality Control Commissioner Judy Berenyi suffered headaches, nausea, and a \"stinging skin\" even from a momentary exposure during the course of her investigations of citizens complaints. The public official witnesses agreed that there had been no citizen complaints of odors or emissions or physical complaints from the operation of the other plants in the vicinity -- such as the Missouri Pacific Railroad yards, Missouri Pressed Metal, DeLong Welding.\n\nThe plaintiffs presented other nonlitigant witnesses, employees of Alcolac, whose descriptions of the emissions, their odors, as well as the physical symptoms induced by exposure, coincided with those of the plaintiffs and their witnesses. These employee witnesses -- Pace, Buckner, Faulconer and LeMaire -- identified the recurrent chemical spills, efflux of contaminated wastewater into the bioponds, monomer reactor explosions, liquid incinerator and acid scrubber malfunctions and, simply, careless management of the chemicals as the sources of the Alcolac emissions and odors. The detection of these emissions as odors of sulphur, rotten eggs, sweetness -- and a variety of other descriptions -- was explained by the characteristics of the chemicals used in the particular phase of production. They testified that exposure to these chemicals and emissions induced in them [as in the plaintiffs and the other witnesses] a burning and watering of the eyes, an irritation to the skin, nose and lungs, cramps in the legs and feet, and numbness and tingling in the extremities.\n\n2\n\nFor the Defendant\n\nAlcolac also presented nonlitigant witnesses, a dozen or so, who resided in the environs or had occasion to come onto the plant premises. They included farmers, businessmen and public officials, as well as employees. A number of them resided adjacent to some of the plaintiffs. Several of the witnesses conducted regular contract work with Alcolac, and a number of the residents had family members employed by Alcolac. Witness Knaus, a farmer, sharecropped Alcolac land. Witness Sneed, also a farmer, cultivated pollen on Alcolac property. There were several among them unrelated to Alcolac by business or personal interest.\n\nThere were some who experienced odors on the residence sites, or when they passed by Alcolac, or when they went upon the plant premises. There were some who discerned none. There were some who had seen foam from Alcolac alight on their property. Those who detected odors described them variously: as rotting eggs, pleasantly sweet, or as new plastic. It was the consistent response to inquiry that the emissions caused no ill effect to their persons. Those who kept gardens, crops and livestock all responded that neither the productivity nor the quality was affected. The well-being of their pets was not impaired.\n\nThere were other acknowledgements on cross-examination, however. Farmer Reine [who lived near the plaintiffs Turley] answered that some of his cows miscarried for reasons the veterinarian could not explain. He responded also that the children suffer \"terrible headaches,\" as does the wife, that she experiences arrythmia and palpitations of the heart, has developed cramps on the calves of the legs, and suffers from an irregular menstrual cycle. Pettis County Sheriff Starke responded that exposure to Alcolac odors brought on a headache and a \"burning, peppery sensation in back of the throat.\" Resident Vicki McFall answered that a drive by the Alcolac plant \"burns your nose.: The regular employment medical examinations, Alcolac chemical operator Henderson acknowledged, cite his complaint of numbness and tingling of the hands or feet. The medical examination reports of Alcolac plant chemist Richardson note the development of abnormal globulins and hemoglobin. The medical examination reports of Alcolac quality control technician Theresa Cecil disclosed two immunity panel abnormalities.\n\nV.\n\nThe Medical and Scientific Evidence.\n\nA.\n\nThe Family Practitioner\n\nDr. Donald J. Allcorn\n\nA number of the plaintiffs consulted Dr. Donald J. Allcorn as personal physician, both for treatment of symptoms they attributed to the Alcolac emissions, and for other reasons of health. Dr. Allcorn, board certified in family practice, maintains an office in Sedalia. Two among them -- Clarence Elam and Dan Pryor -- were treated by Dr. Allcorn for injury from mishaps unrelated to the Alcolac operation. The other seven -- Jacqueline Berry, Virgil Bradley, Dorothy Bradley, Betty Elam, Linda Elam Sanders, Joyce Pryor and her daughter Amber Cross -- consulted with Dr. Allcorn for complaints attributed to Alcolac chemicals, as well as for other conditions.\n\nDr. Allcorn was presented by Alcolac. He gave opinion that toxic chemicals can cause many of the conditions and symptoms the several patients displayed, but that they did not -- \"other than [as to Mr. Bradley, and presumably, the others with like symptoms] those related as possible irritation of his airways due to odors.\" He acknowledged both on direct and on cross-examination that exposure to toxic chemicals can cause chest congestion, urinary tract infection, nose and sinus irritation, skin rashes, abdominal pain, tingling limbs, conjunctivitis, fatigue, respiratory infection, sore throat and dizziness -- the other symptoms and complaints displayed by these several patients. He concluded, however, that none of these symptoms were the result of toxic chemical poisoning, but could be explained by other causes. In the case of Virgil and Dorothy Bradley [75 years old], he implicitly attributed the complaints to their condition of age. In the case of Betty Elam, he attributed the condition of emphysema to cigarette use. Although the witness attributed the other complaints of the patients to causes other than exposure to toxic chemicals, he did not identify those alternatives.\n\nThe opinions rendered by Dr. Allcorn were those of a physician certified in family practice. He readily acknowledged that he had neither special training nor qualification in occupational medicine, preventive medicine, toxicology or immunology. Nor had he dealt with the toxic chemicals used in the monomer production and emission processes -- such as epichlorohydrin, allyl alcohol, dimethyl sulfate, toluene and the others.\n\nB.\n\nThe Immunologists\n\nThe testimony and opinions of the immunologists were based on three sets of laboratory procedures performed between August of 1984 and July of 1985, to test the immune system functions of the several plaintiffs. The plaintiffs presented the testimony and opinion of Arthur C. Zahalsky, professor of microbiology and certified research immunologist. Alcolac presented Daniel J. Stechschulte, certified medical internist and certified clinical immunologist.\n\nThe first immune panel was conducted by the Bioscience Laboratory in Chicago [August of 1984] as an incident of the clinical examinations and diagnoses of the plaintiffs by the Carnow Associates, their experts. All thirty-one \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e28\u003c/span\u003e plaintiffs presented themselves for this series. The second immune panel tests were conducted by the Kansas University Internal Medical Center [December of 1984] at the instance of Alcolac. The protocol for that series of tests -- as defined by Alcolac counsel and internal medicine expert Kerby, a professor at the University of Kansas Medical Center -- excluded ten of the plaintiffs. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e29\u003c/span\u003e It was the surmise of Alcolac expert Stechschulte that the protocol did not encompass the other ten because: \"he information that was available . . . didn't dictate that these individuals had abnormalities in their immune systems.\" The third immune panel was conducted by the Midwest Organ Bank and Wheeler Laboratory in Kansas City [July of 1985] at the instance of immunologist Zahalsky. He was prompted to that initiative by a deemed inadequacy of the KU Internal Medical laboratory test results and because the pervasive abnormalities disclosed by the Bioscience immune tests suggested the need for more particular information of the cell compartments. He explained that the KU laboratory blood analysis tests were inadequate because they expressed results in percentages rather than as within or without normal range references -- as is the common practice -- with the consequence that the counts of the various cell populations could not be determined nor the normality of those counts. The KU procedure was all the more wanting, he explained, because that protocol did not include all of the plaintiffs. It was for those reasons that immunologist Zahalsky arranged for the third immune panel procedure at the Midwest Organ Bank and Wheeler Laboratory in July of 1985. Twenty-four of the plaintiffs were tested. Mrs. Landon by then was under a regimen of cobalt treatment for cancer, and so was disqualified for the tests. The six members of the Turley family were unavailable. The evaluation rendered by Zahalsky as the Turley family members rested on the tests reported by the Biosciences Laboratory in August of 1984. The opinion as to Landon rested on both the Biosciences and the KU immune panel results.\n\nArthur C. Zahalsky, PhD\n\nThe witness defined immunology as the study of the components of the immune system of man and animals -- the cells that compose the system, the appearance of those cells, the origin of those cells, the presence of those cells in the blood, and the balance of those cells. He likened the immune system to \"an internal watchdog or searchlight\" which surveils the cells and expels those components which are not \"okay,\" and thus restores the homeostasis -- the normal state of immunologic balance. The component extruded from the body by this process, the witness explained, might be the result of a mutational effect caused by the activity of a bacterium, or a virus, or of a toxic chemical. An immune dysfunction, accordingly, is the imbalance and dysfunction of the cells of the blood. The consequence of dysfunction is that the \"internal searchlight\" becomes dim so that harmful substances may appear in the body which escape recognition, and hence elimination. One result of dysfunction may be neoplastic disease -- a condition of cancer. Another result, among the many others, may be the inability of the body to fight infection. The immune system function is determined by the genetic code of the person -- none of them exactly alike. The efficiency of the genetic system depends upon the stresses imposed by the mode of life and habits adopted by the person: smoking, the consumption of excessive alcohol, abuse of drugs all stress the immune system. That is to say, they affect how the genetic code expresses itself.\n\nThe immunologist noted that the immune systems of the plaintiffs and of those nonlitigant residents of the environs of Alcolac shared a common insult: the prolonged exposure to the toxic chemicals in the environment in which they lived. He undertook to explain the consequences of the exposure to the toxic chemicals identified with the Alcolac production process in terms of the function of the human immune system. The immune system is not a specific organ but is distributed in the bone marrow, the thymus, the spleen, and in the lymph nodes throughout the body. In terms of function, the immune system has two divisions. One function is the production of antibody cells which are dumped into the blood and circulate to all parts of the body. These antibodies, called B-cells, derive from the bone marrow and spleen and fight off infection. Another function of the immune system is to \"search and destroy,\" and is the \"cell mediated\" arm of the system. Those cells include the T-cells, so-called because they derive from the thymus gland, although they derive also from the lymph nodes and spleen. The T-cells exhibit distinctive characteristics and are of four different types. They remember previous insults and challenges, they live long, and have the capacity to expand. The four types of T-cell populations are the helpers, suppressors, cytotoxic and natural killers. The helpers cooperate with the B-cells to produce antibodies. The suppressors work in balance with the helpers to avoid indiscriminate and undirected responses. The cytotoxic cells are also suppressors and can attack and destroy transformed cells with or without an antibody. The natural killer cells can also attack and destroy without the help of an antibody.\n\nAn imbalance of the helper populations of T-cells [technically designated as T/4], when induced by stresses and insults of toxic chemicals, is a condition of immune system dysfunction properly designated: chemically induces AIDS. In common AIDS, it is the virus [rather than the chemicals] which attacks the helper [T/4] cells and so induces immune system dysfunction. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e30\u003c/span\u003e In either case, whether the imbalance is induced by toxic chemicals or by virus, the result is that much of the T/4 cell population is depressed -- \"functionally wiped out.\" Thus, the balance in the bloodstream \"just goes completely out of whack\" and the production of T-cells cannot keep up with the demand. The consequence, among other dysfunctions, is a progressive erosion in the ability of the person to fight infection. In the case of viral AIDS, the customary course of infection is in the lungs, which eventually leads to respiratory collapse, and death. In the case of chemical AIDS, the progressive erosion of the immune system may induce neoplastic disease -- and cancer. Chemically induced AIDS, the witness testified, is a phenomenon supported in the medical and immunological literature, and is a subject of research at the National Institute of Environmental Sciences.\n\nIt was the opinion of immunologist Zahalsky that the condition of chemically induced AIDS could be brought on by exposure to the chemicals regularly used and produced in the Alcolac monomer process. Epichlorohydrin, toluene and dimethyl sulfate, among the others, are toxic to cells and act to depress the immune system. Dimethyl sulfate is also an alkylating agent which \"sticks\" to cells so that the genetic code sequence \"goes haywire,\" renders the cells toxic and suppresses the immune system. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e31\u003c/span\u003e The witness gave opinion that exposure to a \"chemical soup\" of epichlorohydrin, toluene, dimethyl sulfate, among the others emitted into the Alcolac bioponds over a span of seven years and then carried into the air by suds and vapors, could cause a depression of the immune system to persons in the environs. The actions of these chemicals often induce symptoms which mimic actual diseases, the witness explained, so that an un trained local physician will not recognize that the complaints and symptoms actually bespeak a depressed immune system toxically induced.\n\nZahalsky evaluated the immune system of each of the thirty-one plaintiffs. The witness, a research immunologist but not a clinician, rested the assessments on the laboratory and test data gathered in the immune panel reports from the Bioscience, KU and Midwest/Wheeler laboratories. The witness evaluated the immune system of each plaintiff according to whether the result for each value tested was within or without a normal reference range. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e32\u003c/span\u003e Thus, by the self-evident standard adopted by the expert witness, an abnormality is a test value that falls outside the normal reference range. Also, by that self-evident standard, \"abnormality is not good.\" Hence, the Conclusion of the witness: \"a laboratory report that fails to list the reference ranges is invalid by definition.\" It was, as we note, the perceived unreliability of the KU test results expressed in terms of percentages rather than in terms of reference ranges which prompted witness Zahalsky to recommend that the subjects undergo a third test regimen at the Midwest/Wheeler laboratory.\n\nThe summary of test results from the Bioscience Laboratory noted at least on abnormality, and as many as eight, in the immune system of every plaintiff.\n\nThe test results for every plaintiff from the KU laboratory, expressed in terms of percentages, were interpolated by the witness through the reference ranges of the Midwest/Wheeler forms into determinations of normal, abnormal and marginal. The KU protocol [as did the Midwest/Wheeler tests] encompassed total T cells, helper cells [T/4], suppressor cells [T/8], natural killer cells and other populations. Zahalsky deemed that the most significant test result components were the helper cell [T/4], suppressor cells [T/8] natural killer cells and other populations. Zahalsky deemed that the most significant test result components were the helper cell [T/4] and suppressor cell [T/8] counts. The test result associated with the chemical AIDS condition, Zahalsky noted, was an abnormal helper cell [T/4] count. In the case of plaintiff Carl Berry, the KU test disclosed a T/4 count fully five percentage points above the average -- an abnormality. In the case of Virgil Bradley, the transposed test results disclosed four abnormalities. Of the twenty-one plaintiffs tested under the KU protocol, the transposed results established that the blood cell population of only one -- Joy Sommers, age 15 -- displayed no immune system abnormality. The composite tests disclosed 39 abnormalities of the T cells distributed among the 24 persons tested.\n\nThe results from the Midwest/Wheeler Laboratory established that 19 of the 24 plaintiffs who presented themselves for tests suffered from dysfunction of the immune system. The witness explained that since the T cell population, as an absolute number, changes with age, to enable valid analysis of dysfunction, he segregated the plaintiffs into three age groups -- the young, the intermediates, and the older. The tests of fourteen among the plaintiff groups disclosed the condition of hypo-dysfunction -- that is, a depression in the total number of T cells. The tests of five among them disclosed the condition of hyper-dysfunction -- that is, an elevation in the total number of T cells. Thus, 79% of the plaintiffs tested by the Midwest/Wheeler Laboratory displayed an immune dysfunction of the T cell compartment. The immunologist deemed the finding \"tremendously statistically significant.\" To this number the witness then added the six members of the Turley family group who were not available for the Midwest/Wheeler regimen and Mary Landon by then under treatment for cancer. All of them were earlier tested at the Bioscience laboratory and demonstrated immune dysfunctions. Thus, the combined Bioscience-Midwest/Wheeler immune panel tests established that 26 out of the 31 plaintiffs, or 84% of the total number, demonstrated an immune dysfunction. The witness described that statistic \"an astounding value.\"\n\nThe Midwest/Wheeler immune panel tests included a newly available procedure administered at the direction of immunologist Zahalsky. It was for the T cell monoclonal antibody, HNK-1. That antibody not only detects the natural killers of the T/4 population but also suppressors not found in that population. Ten out of the24 plaintiffs had significantly elevated values in HNK-1, and one person had a reduced count. Four among the plaintiffs tested \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e33\u003c/span\u003e not only displayed elevated levels of HNK-1, but also elevated levels to T/8 suppressor cells. Those values indicated to the expert a gross distortion in the ratio between the helper cells and the suppressor cells -- an indication that the immune system balance is \"out of whack.\" They already suffer severe immune dysfunction, the condition of chemically induced AIDS. Eight others \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e34\u003c/span\u003e already suffer moderate immune dysfunction, although not yet the condition of chemically induced AIDS. The changes in the immune system panels, however, are progressive so that the dysfunctions will develop to the AIDS condition \"somewhere down the line.\"\n\nThe dysfunctions of the immune panels as trends in progress were demonstrated by the results from the Bioscience and the Midwest/Wheeler laboratories -- the two tests the witness deemed reliable. The Bioscience test conducted in August of 1984 reported one abnormality of the immune system for Arnold Sommers. The Midwest/Wheeler test conducted in July of 1985 listed two abnormalities. The progression for Dorothy Bradley listed by those tests within that interim were from one abnormality to five. He noted also that the immune panel of findings of laboratory tests taken of Mary Landon before her cancer condition and cobalt therapy verify that she had a severely depressed immune system. It was the opinion of immunologist Zahalsky, moreover, that the conditions of the other nineteen plaintiffs who then manifested neither severe nor moderate immune system dysfunction would progress into proliferated abnormalities.\n\nZahalsky concluded with the opinion that all thirty-one plaintiffs were suffering from systemic, progressive chemical intoxication. The witness gave opinion that the condition is the consequence of exposure of the plaintiffs in their home environment to toxic chemicals which have induced changes in their immune system. That injury has dampened the immune system so that the plaintiffs will become subject to a variety of diseases, neoplastic disease included. The findings already suggest the possibility of leukemia. The expert would not attempt the clinical prognosis as to \"just how sick this group of people is at the present time and is likely to become.\" That was a matter for a competent clinician -- such as Dr. Carnow, an occupational medicine expert. He did conclude, however, that since the condition of dysfunction was progressive, each of the plaintiffs should have annual laboratory tests for the rest of their lives, and bi-annual tests for the four who already exhibit severe dysfunction. The cost for each such laboratory service is $1000 per person, at the current rate.\n\nDaniel J. Stechschulte, M.D.\n\nAlcolac presented Daniel J. Stechschulte, board certified immunologist and internist, and Director of the Division of Allergy, Clinical Immunology and Rheumatology at the University of Kansas Medical Center. He treats patients at the Medical Center, as well as teaches, but has never treated anyone for a toxic chemical complaint or conducted research on that subject.\n\nThe witness described the immune system in the same terms earlier used by Dr. Zahalsky. His response as a physician to a patient who presents a possible immune system problem is to examine the patient, take a history and review the available information. Symptoms and findings of recurrent infections, hypersensitivity reactions or auto-immune diseases \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e35\u003c/span\u003e suggest immune system dysfunction. A laboratory test may be the adjunct of a more precise evaluation, and the selection of the test depends upon the nature of the symptoms and findings. They help to identify the arm of the immune system involved, and, accordingly, the antibodies of that arm are tested. A test result which does not fall within the reference range -- that is to say, an abnormality -- does not ipso facto signify immune system disease. The abnormality, rather, may be the effect of a variable exogenous to the immune system -- such as the state of nutrition -- which stunts its normal operation. Thus, the clinician interrelates the test abnormalities to the age, gender, nutrition, mode of life of the patient, or other variable to determine whether the variables account for the test abnormalities or if some other cause explains the immune system dysfunction. Thus, the witness explained, the end of immunologic evaluation is not a count of cells, but how well the cells function as elements of the immune system, whatever their count.\n\nViral infections can alter the immune system. Certain toxic chemicals can also alter the immune system. The witness acknowledged the condition called chemically induced immune disregulation. He discountenanced the term chemically induced AIDS to describe that condition of immune dysfunction, however, because \"that common usage now refers to individuals that are infected with the human T-cell leukemia virus, Type III.\"\n\nDr. Stechschulte was consulted as to the immunologic tests to be administered to the plaintiffs under the KU protocol. To inform that advice, Dr. Stechschulte reviewed the available test and clinical records of the several plaintiffs from the Carnow clinic, as well as numerous medical records from other sources. The Midwest/Wheeler immune panel tests had not yet been conducted, and so those results were not available to Dr. Stechschulte. He evaluated these sources for findings of hypersensitivity reactions, recurrent infections or auto-immune disease [indicia of immune system dysfunction], but saw no \"predominance of symptoms in any of these areas\" -- except for Mary Landon. He nevertheless advised certain immune panel tests for twenty-one of the plaintiffs. The decision to exclude ten of the plaintiffs from the tests under the protocol was prompted by the results as \"reliable\" and \"authentic.\" The information they yielded, he explained, \"didn't dictate that these individuals had abnormalities in their immune systems,\" and hence the need for further tests was discounted. The selection of plaintiffs for tests, Dr. Stechschulte explained, was by random method, and included \"patients that were identified as having immune dysfunction\" as well as those the records suggested \"were perfectly normal.\"\n\nThe immune panel tests were administered by Dr. Bodensteiner of the Department of Medicine at the University of Kansas Medical Center. The regimen adopted, the witness explained, was to test function and not merely to count cells. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e36\u003c/span\u003e The functional test elicits how the immune system responds when it is exposed to a particular antigen or organism. The test, actually conducted in the test tube and not in the human body, simulates the response of the immune system to an infection stimulation. The tests administered through the Carnow clinic, the witness acknowledged, were both functional as well as cell counts and were more numerous than the single function test performed under the KU protocol. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e37\u003c/span\u003e The immune deficiency tests conducted by Midwest/Wheeler, on the other hand, were expressed in cell counts but did not measure functional response. Immune deficiency tests measured exclusively by cell counts, the witness suggested, assume a relationship between a normal number of cells and normal function of those cells.\n\nThe evaluatorof the KU test results -- immunologist Stechschulte -- was in any event aware of the various reference ranges and undertook, within a reasonable medical certainty, to interpret the KU results as to each of the plaintiffs subject to the protocol. With the exception of Mary Landon, the evaluator concluded, the clinical history of the plaintiffs examined suggested that \"their immune system was functioning normally.\" There were some, he acknowledged, \"that have laboratory tests that fall outside the arbitrarily defined normal ranges.\" Others displayed \"some subtle changes in their laboratory parameters.\" He concluded, nevertheless, that linically I thought they were normal.\" The clinical factors which prompted that Conclusion were the ages of some of them [seven among the twenty-one were in the sixties and seventies], and the nutritional deficiency of others suggested by red blood indices abnormalities noted in the Midwest/Wheeler tests. The reference range abnormalities notwithstanding, Stechschulte concluded that basically the immune systems were functioning. He deemed in \"highly speculative\" to suggest \" any prognosis as to where their immune systems might be going.\" \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e38\u003c/span\u003e\n\nDr. Stechschulte explained that a disregulated immune system could result in cancer. The latency period to that end-point is \"highly variable,\" and depends on the strain of the cancer -- whether induced by virus, by chemicals or by mutagens. It is known that the use of chemotherapeutic drugs [as in the treatment of the auto-immune diseases] over a period of five to ten years can result in an increased incidence of malignancy in the patient population.\n\nThe witness reaffirmed on cross-examination that on the basis of the clinical histories of the plaintiffs, none of them [Mary Landon excepted] suffered a functional abnormality of the immune system. He reaffirmed also that one of the indicia of functional abnormality is the recurrent infection syndrome -- such as chronic conjunctivitis, chronic urinary tract infections, chronic rhinitis and chronic pharyngitis. These are conditions, the expert acknowledged, which can be caused by exposure to toxic chemicals. Dr. Stechschulte acknowledged that the histories of the plaintiffs included findings of such chronic symptoms. He responded nevertheless that these conditions, even if recurrent, were not sufficient to suggest a deficient immune system, unless the symptoms were bacterial in origin.\n\nDr. Stechschulte explained also that although the medical evidence may find that the plaintiffs suffered from conjunctivitis and other chronic conditions caused by continuous exposure to the toxic chemicals over seven years, that would not necessarily suggest an immune system disregulation [a system out of balance], even accompanied by abnormal laboratory test results. He gave as reasons that conjunctivitis, for example, describes \"a group of disorders,\" some of which may be due to the immune system and others not. Also, he had not come to the diagnosis that these symptoms were recurrent infections. The witness acknowledged that, contrary to his usual clinical procedure, he had not examined any of the plaintiffs - simply because the protocol did not include that procedure.\n\nHe acknowledged again that certain toxic chemicals can suppress the immune system. He understood that Alcolac used alkylating chemicals in its production processes. The effects of alkylating agents on the new cell formations, the expert explained, is to alter their DNA and can lead \"to killing of those cells.\" Dr. Stechschulte agreed that toxic chemicals can cause an increase in the IGA antibody production. That is a condition which may be found in the blood cells of a person who suffers malignancy. The KU protocol did not provide for a test of the IGA levels, and none were made under that regimen. The witness agreed that \"there were certainly some who have elevated IGA levels.\" Virgil Bradley and Dainie Landon were two among them. Dr. Stechschulte agreed that Bradley and Landon \"should be watched and have their IGA levels and other studies done periodically.\" He ascribed as the reason, that the IGA \"is commonly elevated with chronic inflammation chronic inflammation can again be due to a variety of reasons, one of which is malignancy.\"\n\nThe expert witness agreed that it is good medical practice to test every member of a population with symptoms from exposure to toxic chemicals, especially when the exact immunotoxic chemical is not known. He agreed also that it is possible to have an immuno deficiency syndrome even without present disease, but that disease \"may be just later down the road.\" The witness acknowledged that the immune system may change from normal to abnormal, and that such a transition was not subject to prediction.\n\nThe cross-examination of immunologist Stechschulte concluded with this exchange:\n\nQ. Would you agree that these people I represent, who have been impacted by the Alcolac toxic chemicals, should be watched or monitored to determine when such changes might occur?\n\nA. It is appropriate.\n\nVI\n\nA\n\nThe Medical Experts and Biological Causation For the Plaintiffs\n\nIt was the role of Dr. Bertram Carnow to posit that the toxic emissions from Alcolac were the cause in fact of the symptoms, biological manifestations and end points of disease exhibited by each of the plaintiffs. The witness rendered those opinions as a physician, expert in the science of environmental medicine. It is the method of environmental medicine that, to come to a determination as to whether a disease is from an external cause, the investigator establish by a high degree of probability that the environmental event - here the installation of the Alcolac chemical plant and the subsequent emissions of toxic odors, fumes, foam and explosions - be related to the pathology or disease.\n\nThe process of investigation of external cause and diagnosis of disease involves a compound of factors:\n\nIt commences, first, with a related external event - here, the commencement of Alcolac operations and the virtually coincident onset of the emission of fumes, odors and foam discerned by the plaintiffs and other populace in the environs. The related event can be an acute episode - such as an explosion from the monomer reactors, or chronic episodes - emissions over the seven years of Alcolac production.\n\nThe second factor in the process of investigation of causation and diagnosis of disease is exposure to the event. The demonstration of that element, in the context of the evidence, is the observations of incidents of smoke, vapors and foam and the detection and inhalation of the odors and emissions - followed by symptoms. The evidence was replete with accounts by the plaintiffs and other nonlitigant witnesses, resident in the environs, of observed plumes and incinerations, vapor emissions from Alcolac as well as airborne foam from the bioponds. They described the same composite of odors and assortment of symptoms. The odors, moreover, were characteristic of the toxic compounds involved in the Alcolac processes - the lacquer odor of the methacrylates, the rotten egg sensation of hydrogen sulfide and the sweetness of toluene - among others.\n\nThe third element is an effect from that exposure. It is an effect which follows the external event and stands in a reasonable temporal relationship with it, whether the exposure is acute or chronic or whether the effect is acute or chronic. An acute effect usually follows soon upon acute exposure. A chronic effect usually follows from repeated exposures over a prolonged time. The acute effects displayed by not only the plaintiffs but also the nonlitigant residents, were on the mucous membranes and the sympathetic nervous system, and manifested also as irritation of the eyes, nose and throat, headache and vomiting - among the others. The chronic effects from the repeated exposure over the seven year span of toxic emissions were to the major organ systems which were poisoned by the prolonged exposure. It was the Conclusion of the environmental medicine expert, for reasons our Discussion delineates, that every plaintiff suffered both acute and chronic effects from the acute and chronic exposures to the Alcolac toxic emissions.\n\nThe fourth element is whether the effect - here both acute and chronic - is related to the external event, and therefore expected. In the context of the litigation and evidence, the expectedness of the effects of the chemical emissions was demonstrated by the toxicological profiles of each of the toxic compounds prominently involved in the monomer process. The experts drew the toxicological profiles for epichlorohydrin, allyl alcohol, ethyl acrylate, toluene, gylcidyl ether, cyclohexane, methylene chloride, hydorchloric acid, hydrogen sulfide and allyl methacrylate. The experts agreed that many of these toxic compounds induce common physical manifestations, and hence acute effects: epichlorohydrin, allyl methacrylate, allyl alcohol, and ethyl acrylate cause irritation to the eyes, nose, throat, lungs and skin. Exposure to hydrogen sulfide causes dizziness, headaches and vomiting. Chronic exposure to these and the other toxic compounds produces chronic effects to the liver, kidneys and other organs, depresses and destroys the immune system, affects the blood, causes prophyria and even cancer. The chronic effects of two of them is to degenerate the human reproductive system. Epichlorohydrin, ethyl acrylate, toluene, cyclohexane and glycidyl ether all affect the central nervous system. Ethyl acrylate and toluene cause heart arrhythmias or flutters. Cyclohexane causes lethargy, depression, erratic blood pressure and sudden nosebleeds. The evidence was recurrent - as the details of our Discussion relate - that the plaintiffs and others exposed to the Alcolac toxic emissions manifested both these expected acute and chronic effects.\n\nThe fifth element is to determine if others have been similarly exposed and similarly affected. That component of the causation inquiry, the expert concluded, was readily met by the multiple descriptions of the thirty-one plaintiffs as well as by the sixty nonlitigant witnesses of commonly observed related events - the smoke, vapors, foam and other emissions from Alcolac, the inhalations of the various odors - common episodes of exposure, common incidences of acute and chronic effects as disclosed by the examinations and tests of the plaintiffs and by descriptions given in testimony by the nonlitigants. It was the remarkable statistics of commonality of exposure and effect among not only the thirty-one plaintiffs, but also among the sixty nonlitigant residents, which heightened the probability to a reasonable medical certainty that the Alcolac emissions were the cause of the diseases diagnosed in the thirty-one plaintiffs. Thus, although the incidence of numbness and tingling in the extremities is 2% in the normal population, among the plaintiffs and nonlitigant community, the incidence was between 50% and 60%. That manifestation, as the laboratory tests confirmed, was a symptom of peripheral nervous system abnormality. The laboratory tests of the plaintiffs [as our Discussion explains] disclosed that all of the plaintiffs suffer from depressed immune systems and altered cells. They all suffer from abnormal liver metabolism. They all suffer central nervous system damage, except for Lyle Turley, who was not tested because of his youth. The laboratory tests for fertility reported abnormal results for all the seven males who submitted to that procedure. The tests established also that 87% of the plaintiffs suffered some form of porphyria - a very disease in the absence of a toxic source. The expert deemed that result \"incredible\" - and the probability of such incidence in a normal population a quintillion [one billion billion] in the absence of toxic poisoning. It was the unusually high incidence of symptoms, physical manifestations and abnormal laboratory test results of the several bodily organs shared in common by all the plaintiffs which constituted persuasive \"markers\" for the expert that there was an \"extraordinarily strong cause and effect\" connection between the offending toxic agents and the manifestations and disease the plaintiffs displayed.\n\nThe sixth and final element of the causation inquiry is to determine whether or not the pathology found from the laboratory tests is of the kind expected. The pathology disclosed by the examination of the patients - peripheral neuropathy, memory loss, fatigue, and such manifestations - all was of the kind expected from the exposure to the toxic chemical emission agents. The laboratory results of the immune panel studies, the porphyrin counts, and other tests procedures [we presently describe] all confirmed injury and damage to the organ systems expected from chronic exposure to the toxic agents involved in the Alcolac production process.\n\nIt is evident that to evolve a diagnosis, environmental medicine draws upon other sciences and disciplines - among them, occupational medicine, epidemiology, industrial hygiene and biostatistics. In the case where the point source [the related event] is the operation of a chemical plant, toxicology also impinges. A certification in the environmental and occupational medicine specialty, the expert noted, requires learning and adeptness in each of these cognate disciplines. The expert presented by the plaintiffs to derive causation and diagnosis, Dr. Bertram Carnow, was a polymath whose credentials included board certifications in preventive medicine and the occupational medicine subspecialty, in pulmonary medicine and in toxicology. He was an early founder of the environmental medicine subscience, co-chairman of the national certification board for environmental and occupational medicine and conducted numerous epidemiological studies for government, scientific foundations and labor on the effect of chemical and organic pollutants on human populations. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e39\u003c/span\u003e His testimony was received by the court as that of an expert in environmental medicine, occupational medicine, internal medicine, preventive medicine, toxicology and epidemiology.\n\nDr. Bertram Carnow and Dr. Ruth Conibear [his wife] operate Carnow, Conibear and Associates , a consultation firm which offers a wide range of occupational and environmental services to government, business and individuals. It maintains a clinic with laboratories, medical equipment and patient facilities. It is supported by a staff of internists, toxicologists, industrial engineers and other professional specialists and consultants. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e40\u003c/span\u003e The plaintiffs all presented themselves at CCA in August of 1984 for evaluation over a period of two days by Dr. Carnow. [Four of the plaintiffs - Betty Elam, John Lawrence, Gwendolyn Lawrence and Charlotte Phillips - were previously examined at CCA in September of 1983, the year before.] The patient evaluation rested on three components: symptoms, physical findings and laboratory test results.\n\nIt is the postulate of environmental medicine, Dr. Carnow explained, that cause is a cognate of diagnosis, and therefore a cognate of treatment, as well. It is for that critical reason, he said, that to derive a reliable profile that a disease was from an environmental cause, not only must the environmental factors be validly established [that is, Alcolac as the source of the toxic emissions, the quantities, the toxicity of the agents, how they enter the human body, etc.], but also the risk variables of the particular individual afflicted, and the biological end point. The risk variables relate to an assessment of whether the disease diagnosed was altogether the result of chemical poisons or rather of viral origin or of a genetic preDisposition. Thus, a genetic deficiency in alpha[1] antirypsin predisposes to infections of the lung, as do some toxic chemicals. The risk variables relate also to the mode and habits of life of the person. Thus, a cigarette smoker exposed to acrylates, epichlorohydrin or allyl alcohol is more susceptible to severe reaction and disease than a nonsmoker. The biological end point is the effect the toxic chemical has on the body - whether the organs are diseased. In essence, it is another confirmation of causation.\n\nThe process of evaluation at CCA began with an interview of each of the plaintiff-patients. It delved intensively into the family, social, occupational and environmental histories of each, as well as the clinical medical history, present illness, symptoms and complaints. The inquiry probed the environmental factors which the patient related to the symptoms and complaints. The response invariably described the sequence of the commencement of Alcolac operations, the incident of odors, vapors, fumes and other emissions, and physical manifestations of irritation to the eyes, nose, throat, skin, and others. The inquiry probed other environmental factors which the patient related to the Alcolac emissions - the appearance of white residue and foam on plant and animal life with the sequel of blighted vegetation and diseased or dead animals. These environmental phenomena, the expert explained, afford insight into toxicity as well as dose, and of the temporal relationship between event and effect so significant to the determination of causation. Another function of the interview was to enable the examiner to determine the laboratory tests to be administered among the thousands available. That determination was aided by an inventory of the bodily systems most predictably affected by exposure to the toxic chemicals used and produced by Alcolac. In that component of the interview each organ system was \"gone through to try to help the patient remember things that he might have forgotten.\"\n\nDr. Carnow deemed the history derived from the patient interview and the laboratory tests as the most vital aspects of evaluation, and the physical examination less so. The witness explained: physical examination is most informative where the patient presents acute symptoms - such as bleeding, traumatic injury, or other such palpable manifestation. Physical examination is least informative in cases of chronic exposure to toxic chemicals of the kind used at Alcolac because they induce multiple symptoms which mimic other diseases, and so are more difficult to diagnose in the absence of laboratory tests. In such cases, also, physical examination - which for the most part explores the exterior of the body - is least informative to the diagnosis of disease because the toxic chemicals Alcolac emitted are systemic, metabolic poisons which attack and degenerate interior organs. Thus, by the time those manifestations of disease are palpable on physical examination [such an enlargement of the liver, spleen, or other organ], the disease is so advanced that virtually no other aid to diagnosis is needed.\n\nThe process of patient evaluation at CCA was conducted under protocols defined by Dr. Carnow and delegated to staff physicians, specialists and consultants. The symptoms gathered from the interview of each plaintiff-patient were classified by a nosologist - a specialist who conforms patient responses into a common symptom according to internationally accepted definition. Dr. Carnow then reviewed the found symptoms and, as validated, sanctioned the entry of the symptom as an abnormality of the SYMPTOMS chart of the plaintiff-patient. The chart was devised to reflect the human organs most susceptible to injury from exposure to the chemicals Alcolac used, produced and emitted. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e41\u003c/span\u003e Only those symptoms validated by Dr. Carnow as caused by exposure to Alcolac toxic emissions or which represented a severe aggravation of a pre-existent condition were noted under the organ affected. The notation was by an orange dot. That determination of symptom rested on the information derived from the 1984 evaluation process at CCA as supplemented by the trial testimony of plaintiff-patient in 1985. The age and life expectancy of each of the plaintiffs, otherwise proven, were superscribed on each chart.\n\nThe physical examinations of the plaintiffs then followed and were conducted under the protocol defined by Dr. Carnow and delegated to CCA staff physicians Benjamin and Adamji, board certified internists. The abnormalities the examinations disclosed, again as validated by the expert opinion of Dr. Carnow to be effects of the Alcolac emissions, were entered on the PHYSICAL FINDINGS chart of each plaintiff. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e42\u003c/span\u003e The chart was designed to reflect the organ systems most likely to manifest physical findings from exposure to toxic chemicals of the Alcolac ilk. They included the eye, ear, nose, throat and the pulmonary, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, central nervous, peripheral nervous and endocrine systems. A function of the physical examinations, as well as of the derived symptoms, was to enable an informed selection of laboratory tests among the thousands available for the various organs.\n\nThe laboratory tests proceeded under a protocol developed to test those organs and organ functions known to be the biological targets of the chemicals used and emitted by Alcolac: epichlorohydrin, allyl alcohol, ethyl acrylate, toluene, glycidyl ether, cyclohexane, methylene chloride, hydorchloric acid, hydrogen sulfide and allyl methacrylate. The number and kind of laboratory tests administered to a plaintiff were governed by the nature of symptoms, physical findings and related diagnostic incidents of the particular evaluation. A LABORATORY chart listed each organ or organ function for which a test was administered, the description of each test, and noted an abnormal result by an orange dot on the chart of the plaintiff. In some instances, as in the case of the male litigants, a fertility analysis test was offered but not taken. Such incidents of nontest were noted on the LABORATORY chart by a gold star. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e43\u003c/span\u003e The tests administered ranged in number from 25 for youths, Amber Cross and Lyle Turley, to 63 for Carl Berry. The tests were conducted at CCA by staff specialists, others by special consultants, and others by special laboratories. The fertility tests were administered at Cook County Hospital, the prophyrin tests were conducted at the Mayo Clinic by the new high pressure liquid chromatography technique, the immune panels done in 1984 were tested by the Bioscience Laboratory in Chicago, and the immune panels ordered in 1985 by Dr. Zahalsky [in consultation with Dr. Carnow] to delve the startling uniformity of abnormalities reported by Bioscience, were done by the Midwest/Wheeler Laboratories in Kansas City. The normal for each test result was usually expressed as a value within the reference range established for the given test. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e44\u003c/span\u003e A test value outside the reference range was deemed outside the range of normal, and hence abnormal. An abnormal laboratory result signifies that the body is out of balance - thus[the expert evaluator commented], \"it is reasonable to assume that if a laboratory test is abnormal, whether high or low, that this is not good.\" Whether or not the abnormality connotes disease, however, is a matter of medical diagnosis integrated from the history, physical examination and other related data. It was the protocol that an abnormal test result was confirmed by a retest.\n\nThe witness reviewed the clinical information amassed from the interview, physical examination and laboratory procedures as to each plaintiff-patient, and rendered opinion on reasonable medical certainty as to those abnormal symptoms, physical findings and laboratory results he deemed to be caused by the Alcolac toxic emissions. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e45\u003c/span\u003e That delineation was then evaluated into a diagnosis and prognosis as to each of them. The testimony of Dr. Carnow recurrently noted that the chemicals used by Alcolac - epichlorohydrin, allyl alcohol, and the others - are metabolic poisons to the entire bodily system, and hence required test of all the major organs. He prefaced the evaluations of the abnormal results from these tests and the abnormal symptoms and physical findings manifested by the plaintiff-patients by explanations of the target organ and functions of the Alcolac chemicals, the nature of the tests to detect organ function damage, and the significance of the test results.\n\nEAR\n\nA number of the chemicals used and produced by Alcolac are toxic to the 8th cranial nerve, the nerve in the brain which controls hearing. The ear is a high energy system - it works unceasingly - and if the nerves are intoxicated, they damage easily and do not regenerate. People hear at several frequencies, but the frequencies at the upper end are those which first become damaged by toxic chemicals. They may also be damaged from severe noise. Thus a person in a very noisy occupation over a period of years may suffer such nerve damage also.\n\nThe hearing or audiometric test is conducted in a soundproof chamber and the subject is exposed to noises at different frequencies - at 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, 4000 and 6000 cycles - to determine which frequency the subject can no longer hear. Since those at the upper end - 3000, 4000 and 6000 cycles - are those which become damaged by toxic chemicals, they are the focus of the tests. Abnormal test results at those levels signify nerve damage. A person with a normal ear hears at about 20 decibels; 30 decibels is marginal, and the apprehension of 3000 cycles at 50 decibels signifies a hearing loss. A decibel represents a volume determination at a given frequency. The decibel count is a logarithmic number, so that a change from 40 to 45 decibels at a given frequency, for instance, is not a loss of 5, but almost a doubled loss.\n\nTo determine whether in any case the test results represented a hearing loss, the Conclusions from the audiometer were applied to the Spoor Graph. That diagram represents a composite calculation of average hearing levels at different frequencies at each age - with a different average number for men and women. The results of the audiometric tests administered to the plaintiffs were applied to the averages on the Spoor Graph to determine the acuity of the hearing of the persons tested. That transposition, toxicology and medical expert Emmett for Alcolac acknowledged, were done accurately.\n\nThe test results of twenty among the thirty-one plaintiffs were abnormal. The loss of hearing was attributed to exposure to Alcolac toxic chemicals. Occupation noise or presbycusis [hearing loss incurred by age] were eliminated as a cause in each case.\n\nPULMONARY SYSTEM\n\nThe test is the spirometer. The spirometer measures the volume of their intake and the strength of the inhalation. It measures FVC - forced vital capacity - the volume of our intake and the strength of exhalation. The subject blows as hard and fast as possible into a large rubber bag. The bag content is measured and compared with a person of the same age, height and sex. A person with an FVC 80% or more predicted for that age, height and sex is normal. A normal person evacuates 70% to 75% of his air in one second. Any lesser FVC is abnormal and usually attributable to scarring of the lungs. Causes other than toxic chemicals can account for the abnormality. Six of the thirty-one plaintiffs tested abnormally. The abnormalities Dr. Carnow diagnosed were all he deemed caused by exposure to Alcolac emissions.\n\nX-rays were also administered to test the pulmonary system.\n\nCARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM\n\nThe test employed was the electrocardiogram - EKG. It tells about the electric pattern of the heart. The toxic chemicals emitted by Alcolac can irritate the nerve bundle of the heart and damage the heart muscle from want of supply of blood. The pattern described by the EKG informs of any such abnormality.\n\nLIVER METABOLISM FUNCTIONS\n\nThe liver is the largest organ in the body and functions as \"a big factory.\" It processes proteins, sugars, fats and fatty substances. The liver regulates porphyrins, iron, enzymes and prothrombin time. It is also the major detoxifying organ in the body. The toxic agents go to the liver to be purified, but because they are so dangerous, they also damage the liver. The liver is the target organ for epichlorohydrin, toluene, ethyl acrylate, glycidyl ether and allyl alcohol - among the chemical agents used and produced by Alcolac. The toxic emissions from the Alcolac processes are metabolic poisons which can affect the numerous liver systems and functions. The laboratory procedures administered were selected to determine which major functions of the liver may have been damaged. They include tests for metabolism and function of the porphyrins, enzymes, iron, prothrombin time, lipids and proteins.\n\nPorphyrins\n\nThe porphyrins are a small factory within the larger factory - the liver. They are combinations of chemicals which function to produce the heme which then mixes with globin to form the hemoglobin of the red blood cells. Hemoglobin transports oxygen from the lungs to the tissues of the body, and so is critical to life. The heme also goes into the production of the hemiprotein P450 enzymes \"which run the body.\" The prophrins move through the body like a cascade regulated by a series of dams which supplies them to the body as needed. The heme itself is the end product of original eight porphyrins, broken down through the regulation process.\n\nIt is known that epichlorohydrin and some of the other toxic poisons emitted by Alcolac do damage to the system of porphyrin metabolism and the process of regulated flow. Thus, the laboratory test for this liver function was devised to determine any abnormality in the porphyrin system. Until recently, laboratory tests could measure only uroporphyrins and coproporphyrins. A new high pressure liquid chromatography technique available at the Mayo Clinic, however, enables the test and measurement of the entire cascade of porphyrin flow function. Porphyria is the disease which describes the state of abnormal porphyrin metabolism. It has been known as a rare genetic disease, with an incidence of one in an average population of 100,000. It has become known recently that toxic chemicals can also damage the porphyrin system and cause porphyria. Epichlorohydrin can cause porphyria - so can PCB and hexachlorobenzene [the latter two not among the Alcolac chemicals used or made].\n\nSix tests were administered at the Mayo Clinic to the 31 plaintiffs. The tests of four of them disclosed no abnormality. Seven of them exhibited one abnormality, twelve of them two abnormalities, seven of them three abnormalities, and one of them four abnormalities. Thus, the Mayo laboratory results demonstrate that 27 of the 31 plaintiffs [87%] had abnormal porphyrins - some form of porphyria. It was a test finding Dr. Carnow described as \"just incredible.\" The probability of the incidence of porphyria in such a percentage had the Sedalia population not been toxically poisoned - the witness calculated - would be a quintillion [a billion billion]. It was remarkable, as well, he remarked, that 19 of the 31 also had a coproporphia.\n\nOnce the system of abnormal porphyrin metabolism \"is turned on\" the witness explained, \"we don't know any way to turn it off.\" Animal studies show that it might help to reduce the amount of iron in the body - induce anemia. A consequence of the disease may be porphyria crises which are characterized by severe abdominal pain - which some of the plaintiffs have already experienced. The disease also can affect the central nervous system, cause irritability and induce personality change. It can explain, for instance, the sudden impulse to strike a horse between the ears - as did plaintiff Arnold Sommers.\n\nThe disease may develop into the stage called porphyria cutanea tarda, where any exposure to the sun causes the skin to blister, but none of the plaintiffs are at that stage.\n\nEnzymes\n\nThe liver also produces other enzymes necessary to carry out vital bodily functions, such as proteins to aid in the coagulation of the blood. This function of the liver, along with the others, are the targets of most of the several toxic chemicals identified in the Alcolac production process. There are enzymes that are normally inside a liver cell. When the liver cell has been damaged from chemical intoxication or otherwise, they are produced in abnormal quantity and leak into the blood. GGTP, SGOT, SGPT and alkaline phosphatase are among the enzymes normally within the liver cell. Thus, an abnormally elevated count of these enzymes denotes inflammation of the liver. An increase in the alkaline phosphatase enzyme denotes chronic liver damage - although it may signify increased bone activity, as during the repair of a fracture or in young, growing children. LDH is also an enzyme, but not specific for liver disease. An abnormally high count of LDH also denotes inflammation - although it is not specific for liver disease, but may appear when there is muscle inflammation or alteration of cell function in other organs.\n\nIron Metabolism\n\nIron metabolism is usually well regulated, and not many diseases will cause an abnormality of that function. The concern was that since porphyrins use iron in the production of their chemical, abnormal porphyrin metabolism could bring about abnormal iron metabolism. An abnormal test result in iron metabolism, therefore, not only usually reflects abnormal porphyrins, but also an abnormal P450 enzyme system of the liver the porphyrins produce.\n\nProthrombin Time\n\nThe test determines the time it takes to stop bleeding. That function is regulated by vitamin K, manufactured in the liver. A disturbance of vitamin K also disturbs prothrombin time and indicates damage to the liver. The test was repeated because of the unusual number of positive results.\n\nLipid Metabolism\n\n\"Lipid\" means \"fat\" and encompasses an entire group of fatty substances which the liver processes. The lipids tested were HDL cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, cholesterol, triglycerides and lipoprotein phenotype. Abnormal findings as to the metabolism of that group is another mark of liver damage. Since the nerve covers are fatty, abnormality in lipid metabolism can relate to peripheral neuropathy - which is damage to the fatty cover of the nerves. Peripheral neuropathy was a condition found in 15 of the 31 plaintiffs tested.\n\nProtein Metabolism\n\nThe liver also regulates protein activity, and so a series of tests were administered to determine whether any toxic chemical damage was done to the protein metabolism function of that organ. The total protein, alpha 2 globulin, gamma globulin and other proteins were tested for metabolism. One test applied was the protein electrophoresis which moves the blood sample in a field and distinguishes among the proteins and counts them. The significance of abnormal test results is that the protein processing function of the liver has been damaged.\n\nGENITOURINARY\n\nA number of the Alcolac toxic chemicals target the kidneys and damage them: epichlorohydrin, allyl alcohol, ethyl acrylate, toluene, glycidyl ether, dimethyl sulfate and hydrogen sulfide. Kidney damage from a toxic agent produces high uric acid, and the tests were devised to determine that fact as well as the state of the kidney function. The tests included urinalysis, BUN [blood urea nitrogen], which determined whether the kidney is getting rid of poisons, as do the creatinine and uric acid tests. Calcium and phosphorus, potassium and chloride counts also indicate the normality or abnormality of kidney functions, and they were also tested.\n\nFERTILITY ANALYSIS\n\nAlcolac chemicals, epichlorohydrin, and allyl alcohol, can cause severe damage to the reproductive organs. It can cause abnormalities of the perm count in humans and the destruction of testicles in animals. The tests conducted analyze a fresh sperm specimen to determine the count, type of motion, percent of activity, grade and morphology. A single ejaculation produces a normal sperm count of about 100,000,000. A count of between 40 to 60 million is borderline abnormal and a count below 20 million causes difficulty in the fertilization of an egg, especially if they do not move well or remain active for more than four hours. Those represent the Conclusions of the recent Wharton study which was the standard Dr. Carnow adopted as authoritative in his evaluations. The tests administered observed the activity of the sperm at intervals: at the end of 30 minutes 80% should continue to move; at 60 minutes, 70%; at the end of four hours, 60% should continue to move. If less than that number is found, it is abnormal because sperm must live for three days to fertilize an egg. The motion of the sperm is also tested. Normal sperm all move in the same direction at once. Random movement in every direction manifests a poor grade of sperm \"because that means that they are not going any place.\" The morphology is observed - whether they appear normal. A 20% abnormal morphology among the 100 million sperm is expected. Most abnormal sperm will not fertilize an egg, and if they do, \"they can cause a damaged product.\"\n\nThe fertility analysis was performed on the male plaintiffs amenable to the test. Some of them declined or were not qualified because of prior vasectomy. The seven male plaintiffs tested all displayed at least two abnormal fertility analysis results.\n\nCENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM\n\nThe central nervous system and brain are targets of many of the toxic chemicals used by Alcolac - among them, epichlorohydrin, allyl alcohol, toluene, gylcidyl ether, cyclohexane, dimethyl sulfate, methylene chloride and allyl methacrylate. The brain is very fatty tissue, so anything that disturbs the lipid metabolism affects the brain. The brain is a high energy and vigorous organ, so anything that depresses the way the body uses oxygen affects the brain functions. It is for this reason that the health of the porphyrin metabolism system, which produces the heme, is important.\n\nCertain brain functions are affected by toxic chemicals, and certain abnormalities manifest - such as attentional deficits, memory loss, depression and others. The tests administered were to quantify any such damage done to the central nervous system. They were administered by Drs. Garron and Wilson, professors of psychology at the Rush Medical Center in Chicago. The tests [30 of them] included the Halstead neurobehavioral battery - which evaluates the visual-spatial function, ability to concentrate and other functions of the brain. The results determine what functions of the brain, how much and where, are abnormal. Each test of the Halstead battery was scored according to a reference range of normals devised for different populations - adults or children, range of education, socio-economic status, and other specific standards. The Beck depression inventory test was also administered. Toxic chemicals which deprive the central nervous system of oxygen induce depression, because depression is the way the brain reacts to loss of oxygen. It is for that reason that depression is a very common result of exposure to toxic chemicals. The Zung anxiety scale test was also administered to determine the anxiety caused by the exposure to the Alcolac toxic chemicals.\n\nPERIPHERAL NERVOUS SYSTEM\n\nThe tests of the peripheral nervous system were prompted, among other considerations, by the common symptoms reported among the litigants as well as nonlitigants of numbness and tingling of the limbs and cramps in the legs. The peripheral nervous system, moreover, is the target organ of several of the Alcolac toxic chemicals already repeatedly enumerated. The tests administered were of two kinds: the sensory and reflex tests performed on physical examination and the EMG and PNVC tests performed thereafter by Dr. Subbaru, a CCA staff neurologist. The PNVC tests measured both the motor nerves and the sensory nerves. The measurements are in milliseconds and when a nerve is damaged the nerve impulse slows. The EMG tests the nerve by insertion of thin needles into the muscle the nerve controls at the motor end plate. If there is damage to the nerve at that site, there will be an abnormal EMG result. That signifies axonal degeneration - that the nerve fiber itself, not only the sheath, is dying. That damage is irreversible. The toxic chemicals which Alcolac emitted are metabolic poisons and cause polyneuropathy - that is, damage to multiple nerves.\n\nThe peripheral nervous system of ten of the thirty-one plaintiffs tested abnormally.\n\nMUSCULOSKELETAL SYSTEM\n\nIn addition to the EMG, which tested the muscle-nerve relationship, the CPK was administered to determine damage to the muscle. CPK is creatine phosphokinase, an enzyme. \"It makes muscle go, and sometimes in toxic conditions, CPK may be abnormally low or abnormally high if there is a specific type of muscle damage.\"\n\nENDOCRINE SYSTEM\n\nThe toxic chemicals which affect the protein metabolism function of the liver can also affect the thyroid gland of the endocrine system. An abnormality of the P450 enzyme system produced by the porphyrin metabolism of the liver will result in abnormality of the thyroid binding globulin, a protein, which carries the thyroid hormone.\n\nThe thyroid gland regulates some of the way in which the body uses oxygen. Two tests were administered to test the thyroid function, a T3 uptake and the T4 RIA. One tests the triidothyronine and the other the thyroxine component of the gland. The thyroid and liver functions are so interrelated that when the T3 tests low and the RIA high, it connotes not an abnormality of the thyroid function, but of protein metabolism - the thyroid binding globulin.\n\nIMMUNE SYSTEM\n\nThe chemicals involved in the Alcolac process - epichlorohydrin, toluene and dimethyl sulfate, among others - are toxic to human cells and act to depress the immune system. The condition of chemically induced immune disregulation - the immunologists for the plaintiffs and for Alcolac agreed - may result. The procedures administered by CCA in 1984 and then supplemented by the Midwest/Wheeler laboratory in 1985, were designed to test the T cell and B cell components of the immune system for function and abnormality. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e46\u003c/span\u003e\n\nThe immune system is separated into the B cell and T cell components. The immunoglobulins are that part of the B cell component which helps protect against common infections. The major globulins, G, A and M were tested. An abnormality in the immune system or in protein metabolism may reflect in abnormality of globulins. An abnormal finding in this group means the immunoglobulins are not functioning.\n\nAnother series of tests of the immune system was the mitogen challenges. The purpose of these tests was to determine whether the body has adequate defenses - whether the body will attack if it sees an enemy. In a normal immune system, the lymphocytes of both the B cell and T cell components attack potentially harmful invaders. They also attack abnormal cells naturally produced by the body as well as those proliferated by toxic agents. A mitogen challenge is a procedure wherein lymphocytes are taken from the blood and, unstimulated, and energy emitted in counts per minute is tested. That is the unstimulated CPM phase of the mitogen test. Then the unstimulated lymphocytes are presented with an enemy - an antigen - in this case, plant proteins. That should cause the lymphocytes to attack and the counts per minute to increase. When the counts increase, that means the lymphocytes are attacking, if they do not increase, that means that they are not attacking. The failure to attack is a test abnormality. The reactions of one type of T cell lymphocyte to the mitogen challenges is reflected in the PHA, CPM and the PHA Stimulation Index. The reactions of another type of T cell lymphocyte to the mitogen challenges are reflected in the CON A CPM and CON A CPM Stimulation Index. The B cell lymphocytes were tested by the poke weed mitogen , another plant protein and the reactions are reflected in the PWM Index. The basic function of the panels administered by Bioscience, therefore, was to test the immune functions of the cells - that is, \"when they see an enemy, do they attack the enemy?\" It was the unusual findings of T cell abnormalities from these mitogen challenges that prompted Dr. Carnow to confer with immunologist Zahalsky and then to arrange for further tests of the patient-plaintiffs by the Midwest/Wheeler laboratory.\n\nThe supplemental procedure conducted by Midwest/Wheeler in 1985 not only further tested the immune system but also the hematologic system.\n\nOther immune system tests administered by CCA and conducted by the Bioscience laboratory in 1984 were to the white cell populations of the patient-clients. They are part of the defense system, and the segs subpopulation increases when infection is present. The tests also counted the total lymphocytes, and eosinophil, monocyte and basophil populations.\n\nThe basic function of the panels administered by Midwest/Wheeler was to further define the subpopulations of the lymphocytes, the T cells and the B cells. The purpose of the tests was to determine the kind of T cells in the lymphocyte populations - the helpers, suppressors, killers or memory T cells, and also whether the relationships are out of balance. These test results inform whether or not there may be suppression in the bone marrow, or whether or not the T cells are unprogrammed when they leave the lymphatic tissue - and other such insights.\n\nIt was the Conclusion and opinion of Dr. Carnow that the Midwest/Wheeler tests determined that the patient-plaintiffs exhibited immune system abnormalities in multiple areas, \"particularly of the T lymphocyte series,\" that the T lymphocytes can be damaged by toxic chemicals of the kind used by Alcolac. It was the Conclusion of the expert, also, that the Midwest/Wheeler results demonstrate and confirm that \"the immune systems of most of the Sedalia people were very severely depressed because of damaged organs\" from exposure to the Alcolac emissions.\n\nThe purpose, role and function of each of the laboratory procedures thus elaborated, Dr. Carnow then evaluated the symptoms, physical findings and abnormal laboratory results as to each of the patient-plaintiffs [within the context of a detailed personal, clinical and occupational history of each as augmented by the trial testimony] to derive a diagnosis of the biological pathology and disease caused to each organ or function by the Alcolac toxic chemical emissions. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e47\u003c/span\u003e The symptoms, physical findings and abnormal laboratory results found - as well as the diagnosis as to each plaintiff-patient were those evaluated as attributed to the Alcolac operations by a reasonable medical certainty. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e48\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003e* Died during pendency of appeal and the spouse was substituted as party by order.\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003e1.

Thus the causes of action of the thirty-one plaintiffs who remained were submitted against Alcolac only.\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003e2. See Appendix A. The Alcolac facility also included four biodegradation ponds, whose function the opinion describes, as well as a warehouse and lakes.\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003e3. The WAPORA design for the Alcolac plant at Sedalia selected the carbon adsorption system for the control of the pollutants from the monomer production process as the ideally efficient alternative. It also proposed \"scrubbers\" to cleanse the liquid waste from the monomer production, but only \"f operational testing shows that a potential environmental problem remains after these measures are taken.\" It became evident to the Missouri Department of Natural Resources [the official agency with oversight of the Alcolac operations] that the system for pollution control, as installed and operated, was not effective to meet environmental control standards. It was a condition of the abatement agreement concluded by Alcolac and the Department of Natural Resources on May 30, 1980 [as our Discussion more fully delineates] that Alcolac install two alkaline scrubbers to remove the acrylates from the liquid waste streams and the gaseous waste streams from the monomer reactors. They were duly installed by Alcolac.\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003e4. There was some intimation in the Bregman testimony, also, that Alcolac installed some sort of aeration system in the biopond, but apparently not of a design WAPORA considered effectual to degrade the volume of additional toxic chemical waste from the increased production.\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003e5.

The full evidence explains that when a scentometer inspection detected an odor in the dilution ratio of 7 to 1 or greater - measured at that concentration twice within the hour and fifteen minutes apart - an \"excess emission\" was established. A notice of \"excess emission\" was thereupon served upon the source [here, Alcolac]. The source was then allowed fifteen days to file a \"start-up/shut-down or malfunction plea\" - [apparently operation-emission]. If the plea was rejected by the DNR, the \"notice of excess emissions\" was raised to the status of a formal \"violation.\"\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003e7. See APPENDIX G and H for the full text of the memorandum of the Alcolac plant manager Sutton to the employees.\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003e8. The surfactant factory was also equipped with scrubbers - acid scrubbers - designed to remove chemicals from the vapor wastes before they were emitted through the surfactant stack. There was evidence that the acid scrubbers functioned only 30% of the time, with the consequence that odors and substances emitted into the atmosphere. The acid scrubbers were not a subject of the abatement agreement.\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003e9.

The entry onto the Alcolac premises for testing purposes under the court order was deferred for a week.

The environmental control systems Jacko observed and described were those as \"updated\" and in place at the time of his observations and environmental appraisals in 1984 and 1985. The caustic scrubbers were installed in the monomer building as a result of the May 30, 1980 abatement agreement with the DNR. The liquid incinerator [according to Blowers], never effective as the environmental control device for the disposal of hazardous waste, was no longer in use after mid-1981. Accordingly, the testimony of Dr. Jacko does not allude to that mechanism, nor does his opinion that Alcolac functioned as a \"closed system\" consider the evidence of the malfunction of the liquid incinerator from 1978 WAPORA and the DNR to Alcolac of the adverse environmental effects of the continued malfunction of that device.\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003e12.

The toxicology of the Alcolac chemicals was the subject of the testimony of expert witnesses Dr. Marvin Legator and Dr. Betram Carnow for the plaintiffs, and Dr. Sorrell Schwartz and Dr. Edward Emmett for the defendant Alcolac. That testimony established that the Environmental Protection Agency toxic substance list numbers 130,000 industrial chemicals as toxic.

The common practice [Zahalsky explained] is for the normal reference range for each test of the various blood cell populations to be printed on the face of every test report form. The cell population values of particular interest to an immune deficiency evaluation are the total T cells, the count of helper T cells [T/4], the count of suppressor T cells [T/8], and the helper suppressor ratio, the mature B cell count and the natural killer cell count -- among others. The normal range for each of these values -- as is the common laboratory practice -- is printed on the face of each of the Midwest/Wheeler test report forms. These ranges are derived from the most current immunologic literature and from other authoritative sources -- such as Eli Lilly \"Medifacts\" and the Smith-Kline Labs.

In fact, as immunologist Stechschulte described the test result procedure, Dr. Bodensteiner relied on the Midwest/Wheeler test counts to compare and validate his own results: \"He basically took individuals and took paired samples, and sent one to Midwest Organ Bank and sent the other to his machine, and then compared the results when they came back.\"\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003e37.

A reference range used by a laboratory, the expert explained, represents a normal derived from its experience from tests done on masses of population. It expresses the mathematical principle of two standard deviations from the average, itself a reflection of the statistical postulate that test results of random populations fall along a bell-shaped curve. The postulates of statistics predict that 67% of the test population will fall within the tent of the bell- on both sides of the mathematical mean. That value represents the first standard deviation from the mean. The extension of the curve to encompass 95% of the test population defines the second standard deviation from the mean, and defines normal. The 95% value represents the confidence level required by statisticians that the results of the particular study are not arrived at by pure chance, and hence of statistical significance. See Moultrie v. Martin, 690 F.2d 1078, 1082 (4th Cir. 1982); M. Dore, Law of Toxic Torts § 25.03 [Environmental Law Series, Clark \u0026 Boardman, 1987]. The 5% is known in statistics as the p-value. The role of chance is assessed by the p-value, which indicates the probability that an observed association exists by chance alone. A small p-value implies that chance is an unlikely explanation. Occupational Safety and Health Administration, Identification, Classification and Regulation of Potential Occupational Carcinogens, 45 Fed. Reg. 5096 (1980) [OSHA Carcinogen Policy].

The variations in the reference ranges used from certified laboratory to certified laboratory results from the age and quality of the machines, as well as the test methods used. This is especially true of immunological tests, since the one laboratory may use test antibodies with different characteristics from those used by another laboratory. For instance, the Midwest/Wheeler laboratory used the OKT antibody for various test purposes, whereas the KU laboratory used the Leu antibody for its purposes - each manufactured by a different drug company and each with different characteristics. It was the absence of any reference ranges for the immune panels tested under the KU protocol which prompted both Dr. Carnow and immunologist Zahalsky to the Conclusion that the results were meaningless and invalid.\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003eThe expert noted that numerous reference ranges, derived from universal statistics, are virtually conclusive: such as blood pressure and pulse rate values.

An abnormal result as to any immune system test, as already related, was noted by an orange dot on the LABORATORY chart of the particular patient-plaintiff. [See n41, Appendix N-1, N-2 and N-3]. Since the charts were composed by Dr. Carnow at the Conclusion of the Bioscience laboratory tests administered by CCA in 1984, they did not provide for any abnormal test results from the Midwest/Wheeler tests. The orange dots for those abnormal results were entered at the direction of Dr. Carnow by counsel at the trail and appear on each LABORATORY chart. Midwest/Wheeler tested not only the white blood cells, however, but also the red blood cell system, and any abnormality in the latter system is noted by an orange dot aside the HEMA legend. The nature of the abnormality of either Midwest/Wheeler test was explained in the course of the Carnow testimony.\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003e47. See: APPENDIX 0-1, 0-2 and 0-3 are the DIAGNOSIS charts as completed and validated by the expert medical opinion of Dr. Carnow and represent the biological damage caused by the Alcolac toxic chemicals to litigants Dorothy Bradley, Arnold Sommers and Lance Turley. The witness completed and validated a like DIAGNOSIS chart for each of the patient-plaintiff litigants.\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003e48. The symptoms, abnormal findings, and abnormal laboratory test results Dr. Carnow attributed to exposure to the Alcolac toxic agents [and from which diagnosis derived] were entered as to each plaintiff as a dot according to the bodily organ affected. Thus, three summaries were composed and received as demonstrative exhibits: SUMMARY OF SYMPTOMS, SUMMARY OF ABNORMAL PHYSICAL FINDINGS, SUMMARY OF ABNORMAL LABORATORY TESTS. They appear as APPENDIX P-1, P-2, P-3. The large dot in each summary indicates that the organ under which it was entered was affected by the Alcolac toxic agents. The smaller dot entered alongside indicate the number of abnormal symptoms, finding, or laboratory test result as to that organ.\u003c/span\u003e\n\n",
