    "body": "B\n\nThe Medical Experts and Biological Causation For the Defendants\n\nIt was the role of Dr. Edward A. Emmett and Dr. R. Kerby to derive opinion whether the toxic emissions from Alcolac were the cause in fact of the symptoms, biological manifestations and end points of disease of the plaintiffs, as diagnosed by Dr. Carnow.\n\nIn May of 1984, Alcolac undertook to consult with Dr. Greenberger, Chairman of the Department of Medicine at the University of Kansas Medical Center, to arrange for the interviews and physical examination of the thirty-one plaintiffs. Dr. Greenberger was preoccupied with regular duty and referred the task to Dr. Kerby, a physician, board certified in internal medicine and specialist in pulmonary disease. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e50\u003c/span\u003e To prepare for the interview and examination procedures, Dr. Kerby had access to the Carnow, Conibear \u0026 Associates records of the examinations, symptoms, laboratory results, prior medical history and treatment and diagnostic Conclusions entered by Dr. Carnow as to each of the thirty-one plaintiffs. It was the purpose to consult a specialist in pulmonary disease for these procedures because of the pulmonary aspects of the complaints and diagnoses entered by Dr. Carnow. It soon became apparent \"that it involved multi systems,\" and hence the examinations were organized to that end.\n\nDr. Edward A. Emmett, \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e51\u003c/span\u003e a physician in internal medicine and occupational medicine, and a board certified toxicologist, was engaged by Alcolac to consult with Dr. Kerby and to adopt a protocol for the examinations and laboratory tests to be administered to the thirty-one plaintiffs. The responsibility for the physical examinations of the plaintiffs was delegated to Dr. Kerby, and the selection of the laboratory tests to be administered was settled by Dr. Kerby and Dr. Emmett. The protocol of the laboratory procedures was organized only after consultation with the staff at the University of Kansas Medical Center expert in the diagnosis and treatment of the various organ systems the records furnished by the plaintiffs disclosed were affected by exposure to the Alcolac chemicals. There was no reason to question the accuracy of the analyses of the biochemical tests done by Bioscience Laboratory [a facility the University of Kansas Medical Center often used for special tests] witness Kerby explained, and hence it was decided that those test procedures would not all be duplicated.\n\nTests conducted at other facilities were also not all duplicated since those values were also generally reasonable and new tests were not necessary to valid diagnosis. The fertility analysis was not repeated, nor the audiometry, nor the neurobehavioral battery, nor the porphyrin fractions. The other procedures -- such as the neurophysiological examination, pulmonary function test and thyroid panel -- were administered selectively. The prothrombin time -- a test of ability of the liver to process a vitamin which affects the coagulation of the blood -- was repeated as to each plaintiff. The reason was that the results of the tests administered under the auspices of CCA all reported the same abnormality. In fact, however [as Dr. Emmett acknowledged], that very anomaly -- that they \"looked funny\" -- was noticed by Dr. Carnow, who caused them to be rerun. The retest noted two affirmative prothrombin time results -- for Amber Cross and Lance Turley. Dr. Emmett did not recall the results of the retests.\n\nThe immune panels were delegated to clinical immunologist Stechschulte [although actually administered by Dr. Bodensteiner of the department of immunology] with the prerogative to \"perform whatever immunologic tests he saw fit.\" That phase of the K.U. protocol excluded ten of the plaintiffs so that only twenty-one immune panels were administered. The election was prompted by consideration of the immune deficiency states already diagnosed by the plaintiff experts as well as the need in those cases \"to be more certain there was or was not the presence of some defect in the immune system.\"\n\nDr. Emmett was asked to define a reference range and its role in the evaluation of diagnostic tests. A reference range, he explained, is \"what you would expect most people to have in some kind of reference population -- ninety-five percent of the .\" Dr. Kerby concurred that a test value outside of the usual range -- where 95% of a given population would test -- is considered an abnormal test value. A laboratory response, however, may vary from day to day for numerous reasons. Thus, in terms of diagnosis, a value outside the reference range of a diagnostic test must be interpreted in the context of history, examination, other tests and other relevant medical considerations. The witness Emmett acknowledged that he could not recall ever having seen results of the particular immune panel tests without accompanying reference ranges, as was the case with the K.U. laboratory workup.\n\nAmong the organs tested for disease and dysfunction by Bioscience for the plaintiffs and by K.U. Medical Center for Alcolac was the liver. The toxicologists agreed that the liver was a target organ of allyl alcohol, glycidyl ether, toluene, and virtually all of the other chemicals used and identified as part of the Alcolac monomer process. The liver, internist Kerby explained, has many multiple functions. It metabolizes, excretes metabolic waste and synthesizes substances important to the bodily function. There are standard tests to determine the integrity of the liver cell and these functions. The test for the integrity of the liver cell involves a group of enzymes -- SGOT, SGPT and LDH -- normally within the cell, but which leak into the blood when a liver cell is damaged. The detection of these substances in the blood in increased quantities signifies damage to the liver. Toxic chemicals -- such as the components of the Alcolac monomers -- kill liver cells and so increase the incidence of these substances in the blood. The liver also excretes the metabolic waste out of the blood. The bilirubin, a breakdown product of hemoglobin, and the enzymes GGPT and alkaline phosphatase are present in the blood when the excretory function of the liver is impaired. The liver also synthesizes substances that are important to the bodily system. The clotting of the blood is an aspect of liver synthesis function and is measured by the prothrombin time test. Other substances commonly measured to test the synthesis function of the liver are the serum albumin and cholesterol -- a lipid which increases in the blood when the synthetic function of the liver is diseased.\n\nThe tests described by Dr. Kerby for the integrity of the liver cells and liver function were all administered to all of the plaintiffs by Bioscience under the CCA procedure. The tests [except for the prothrombin time] were done by K.U. Medical Center only very selectively among the several plaintiffs. The results of the liver function panels returned by Bioscience show at least two abnormal test values for every plaintiff. A subdiagnosis entered by Dr. Carnow as to every plaintiff was liver dysfunction in some particular. The experts Kerby and Emmett did not quarrel with the abnormal values reported by these panels of tests. They did not rerun them on each of the plaintiffs as a matter of routine because the Bioscience Laboratory does reputable work. They did question nevertheless, that the abnormal test values -- in themselves -- were clinically sufficient to sustain the diagnoses entered by Dr. Carnow.\n\nA recurrent subdiagnosis entered by Dr. Carnow, and noticed by these Alcolac experts, was abnormality of the porphyrin metabolism function of the liver. The porphyrins, these experts explained, are necessary for biological reactions in all the cells in the body. Therefore, the ability to synthesize porphyrins is synonymous with life. The hemoglobin of the red blood cells -- which binds the oxygen transported into the bodily tissues -- are produced in part from porphyrins. The porphyrins themselves are the end result of a series of syntheses from chemical delta ALA through intermediate steps [described by Dr. Carnow as \"cascades\"] to the porphobilinogen porphyrin, to the uroporphyrin, then to the carboxylics, then to coporoporphyrin, then to protoporphyrin. This process of porphyrin synthesis is catalyzed by a series of enzymes along the pathway [or \"cascade\"].\n\nThe diseases associated with porphyrin metabolism, Dr. Kerby explained, result when a step in the process of porphyrin synthesis is blocked. That may occur from a deficiency in one of the enzymes that catalyze these steps. When the next step of porphyrin synthesis is blocked, the porphyrins accumulate into an unhealthy state. The vast number of enzymatic defects, as well as other forms of porphyrin disease, are inherited. The most significant disease of porphyrin metabolism is porphyria. It results from a block between the porphobilinogens and the uroporphyrins. These compounds accumulate and are toxic to the nervous system. They cause destruction of the peripheral nerves, spinal cord processes and brain. The symptoms of a block there are pain in the belly [because those nerves are involved], paralysis, peripheral nerve dysfunction, numbness and tingling. Another block which causes porphyria is at the uroporphyrin to coproporphyrin step. The uroporphyrin accumulates in the blood and gets into the tissues. The result is skin photosensitivitiy -- rashes, boils, blisters, scars, and skin disfigurement to the part of the body exposed to sunlight. That disease is known as porphyria cutanea tarda.\n\nToxic chemicals may also cause porphyria. The dysfunction caused by toxic chemicals is usually a block at the uroporphyrin to coproporphyrin step. The porphyrin which accumulates in the urine as a consequence is most commonly the uroporphyrin. The result is the same skin photosensitivity and porphyria cutanea tarda as from a block at that step of porphyrin synthesis from genetic causes. To test for disease the quantity and fractions of the porphyrins accumulated from the dysfunction of metabolism are measured in the urine of the person. That was the test administered to all of the thirty-one plaintiffs at the Mayo Clinic by the HPLC technique. The quantitation and fraction of the porphyrins was a test the K.U. protocol excluded altogether.\n\nDr. Kerby deemed it important to separate two phenomena -- porphyrinuria and porphyria. Porphyrinuria is the presence in the urine of porphyrins, usually coproporphyrin or uroporphyrin. It is a not uncommon condition. Porphyria is a disease associated with the substances in the body cells. It is \"really a very rare disease,\" Dr. Kerby explained. The presence of mildly elevated levels of porphyrins of various types in the urine -- as the review of the Mayo Clinic tests disclosed -- he concluded, does not signify an abnormal state. Nor is there any \"scientific credibility\" that \"too few porphyrins\" represents an abnormal disease state -- as the diagnosis by Dr. Carnow assumes. He gave opinion that \"a persistent problem with prophyrin metabolism related to enviornmental exposures to a chemical would probably produce a consistent defect.\" It would be expected -- since the block in such cases is between the uroporphyrins and the coproporhyrins -- that the porphyrin to appear in the urine be uroporphyrin. The porphyrin measurements in the urine of the plaintiffs, however, show a variety of patterns -- only four among them with elevated uroporphyrins. To signify porphyria, however, the expected uroporphyrin elevation is many times the normal level. It was the Conclusion of Dr. Emmett -- whose expert testimony of the subject was congruent with that of Dr. Kerby -- that from analysis of the Mayo Clinic test results, none of the plaintiffs had the porphyria disease. Dr. Kerby acknowledged, nevertheless, that the eighty-seven percent incidence of porphyrin test abnormalities in a population of thirty-one was \"robably a bit high -- probably abnormal.\" He acknowledged also that the state of abnormality could be caused by toxic chemicals. The opinion of toxicology expert Emmett intimated that epichlorohydrin can cause prophyria. Another toxicology expert for Alcolac, Dr. Schwartz, deemed it \"certainly plausible\" that exposure to that compound can cause porphyria since epichlorohydrin has a \"fairly extensive ability to interact with the liver.\"\n\nAnother test procedure administered to all of the plaintiffs by CCA was the audiometer. The experts Kerby and Emmett did not include that test in the K.U. protocol but relied on the results of the procedure conducted at the CCA facility to derive diagnosis of hearing loss. To evaluate hearing loss, Dr. Carnow applied the results of the audiometric tests to the Spoor Graphs -- composites of the average hearing levels at different frequencies for persons of each age and gender. Hearing loss -- in one degree or another -- from damage to the 8th cranial nerve from the Alcolac toxic chemicals was entered as a subdiagnosis as to seventeen of the thirty-one plaintiffs tested. Alcolac toxicologist Emmett acknowledged that toxic chemicals can damage the 8th cranial nerve and so cause hearing loss. The two most common causes for the condition, he explained, were age [the condition presbycusis] and occupational noise. Conductive loss -- not from damage to the cranial nerve, but from an obstruction to the conduction of the sound to the nerve -- also results in impairment of hearing. The review of the audiometric results from CCA and from the history and records of the plaintiffs prompted the experts Kerby and Emmett each to attribute the hearing loss shown by the audiometer in each case either to age, occupational noise or to conductive loss.\n\nThus, it was the Conclusion of the Alcolac medical experts that in no instance was the hearing loss tested by the audiometer induced by exposure to toxic chemicals. It was the response of toxicologist Emmett, moreover, that none of the chemicals identified as used in the monomer production process affected the 8th cranial nerve or the hearing function. Emmett acknowledged on cross-examination, however, that authoritative texts report high frequency hearing loss in rats exposed to toluene, a loss apparently irreversible. Those authorities also report, Dr. Emmett agreed, that the observed tone pips in the rat exposed to toluene \"are similar to those seen in human patients with sensorineural hearing loss\" and \"are in contrast to the patterns observed in patients with conductive hearing loss.\" Emmett qualified that agreement with the observations that these findings were at levels \"more high-pitched than tested normally on the human audiograms.\" He commented also that \"he rats were exposed to very high levels of toluene.\"\n\nThe protocol adopted by the Alcolac experts excluded fertility analysis of the male plaintiffs as well. The experts Kerby and Emmett resorted to the results of the sperm tests conducted at the Cook County Hospital for evaluation and diagnosis of the testicular function. Seven of the male plaintiffs presented themselves for analysis at the Cook County Hospital, and all seven of them tested abnormal in at least two categories. The test procedure measured the count of live sperm, the grade, motion, activity and morphology. The count measures the number of sperm per milimeter of semen. The grade measures the number of primitive cells, pathologic sperm. The motion measures the direction of movement -- motion in the same direction facilitates fertilization of the egg. The activity measures how many sperm remain alive at the elapse of periods to time -- 60% should remain in motion at the end of 4 hours in order that the number needed to travel into the fallopian tube to fertilize the egg remain alive for the 72 hours necessary for that trip. The morphology measures the appearance of the specimen -- a quantity of more than 20% poorly made sperm in one specimen is abnormal.\n\nA single ejaculation produces 100,000,000 sperm. In his evaluations of the Cook County Hospital measurements, Dr. Carnow applied the 60,000,000 live sperm count in a specimen as the normal standard, a count of between 40 and 60 million as borderline abnormal, and a count below 20,000,000 as sterility. Dr. Emmett applied the count of 20,000,000 as the normal -- at \"the lower level of the reference range.\" That standard, Dr. Emmett explained, was the more contemporary and reflected the diminished male fertility in developed countries. He added, however, that \"in the United States the average now is forty-eight million, which actually falls below the sixty unit [applied by Dr. Carnow].\" He acknowledged nevertheless that the standard applied by Dr. Carnow to derive evaluations and subdiagnosis of the seven plaintiffs was the normal reference range noted in the authoritative text, Casarett and Doull's Toxicology (Second ed. 1980). That authority also reports that a sperm count of less than 20,000,000 generally constitutes sterility.\n\nDr. Emmett found no clinical significance to the fertility test results entered at the Cook County Hospital for the seven plaintiffs. The diagnoses entered separately by Dr. Emmett and Dr. Kerby found the reproductive systems of all of them normal. Dr. Emmett did comment that there was one among the seven who \"should probably have repeated tests.\" He did not identify the one, nor was any test repeated. He gave opinion also that there was no basis to conclude that any of the Alcolac chemicals cause infertility. He acknowledged that \"sperm count or fertility testing [can be] a marker for chemical damage,\" but gave opinion that there was no basis to conclude that any of the Alcolac chemicals cause infertility. It was the opinion of Dr. Kerby, however, that plaintiff \"Dan Pryor's problem [with infertility]\" -- which that expert attributed to alcoholic consumption, \"could be caused by toluene.\" That compound is noted by Casarett and Doull's Toxicology (Second ed. 1980) as toxic to sperm and male reproduction.\n\nThe commonality of tingling, numbness and other unusual sensations in the limbs of the ninety persons resident in the environs of Alcolac -- plaintiffs and nonplaintiffs alike -- and knowledge that exposure to a number of the Alcolac chemicals induces such symptoms prompted Dr. Carnow to administer to all thirty-one plaintiffs a neurological examination and nerve conduction/electromyograph battery. The Alcolac protocol included only three of the plaintiffs for comparable neurophysiological tests at K.U.: John Phillips, Charlotte Phillips and Arnold Sommers.\n\nIt was the testimony of Dr. Emmett that numbness and tingling of the limbs is a common complaint from exposure to toxic chemicals. These symptoms suggest, among other diseases, symmetrical polyneuropathy. It manifests in symmetry because the chemicals affect the long nerves of the spinal cord on both sides. It starts in the hands or legs and moves upward. There are other causes -- alcohol and diabetes among them. To reach diagnosis, tests are done of reflextion and sensation, and then studies of nerve conduction. Emmett diagnosed three among the plaintiffs -- John Phillips, Charlotte Phillips and Arnold Sommers -- for symmetrical polyneuropathy. Dr. Emmett and Dr. Kerby concluded that the state of disease found in all of them was not attributable to Alcolac, but was from other cause. It was the subdiagnosis entered by Dr. Carnow that twenty among the plaintiffs exhibited a state of peripheral polyneuropathy caused by exposure to the Alcolac chemicals. Dr. Emmett was not \"particularly surprised\" that the tests disclosed that one-half of the plaintiffs exhibited abnormal sensory conduction in the lower extremity, one-fourth of them exhibited abnormal motor conduction in the lower extremity, or that one-fifth of them exhibited abnormal electromyographic studies. Nor did Dr. Emmett consider significant to diagnosis the statistic simpliciter that 78% of the residents of the environs who gave testimony complained of daily, unremitting, tingling of the extremities. It was an opinion not shared by the other Alcolac expert, Kerby, who concluded that, the 3% incidence of such symptoms in the average population considered, the 78% statistic -- \"if indeed true\" -- is \"different than the usual.\"\n\nThe two Alcolac medical experts, Emmett and Kerby, then entered separate diagnoses for each of the plaintiffs. These determinations rested on the examination reports, findings on physical examination, results of laboratory tests and panels, and on the personal, occupational and medical history of each compiled under the CCA regimen. The diagnoses of Emmett and Kerby rested also on the interview examinations and histories and on the elective laboratory test results administered among the plaintiffs under the K.U. protocol. These diagnoses did not include evaluations of the immune panels administered by Bioscience, Midwest/Wheeler and K.U. Medical Center. That element of evaluation was left to immunologist Dr. Stechschulte, as our opinion already reports.\n\nThe function of the enviornmental medicine physician, Emmett explained, is less to treat by therapeutic care, than to establish a causal diagnosis for a bodily state. The end of such diagnosis is to determine \"not only what somebody has, but why it is caused.\" In that exercise, cause etiology and diagnosis are ineluctable. The etiology may be an external event [such as a toxic exposure] or an occupational source, or a preexistent physical disease, or a life habit -- among others. It is because there may be \"hundreds of different causes\" for a physical complaint or symptom that the history given by a patient is the most important single component of diagnosis. The medical cause is derived through the method of differential diagnosis which discards possible causes for the same symptom or condition for the cause which the physical findings, laboratory tests, history and best scientific data indicate with sufficient probability explain the symptom or condition.\n\nA logical temporal relationship between the event and the physical effect bears significantly to validate causation. Thus, an irritant dermatitis which manifests the day after exposure -- Dr. Emmet explained -- tends to establish the exposure as the cause of the dermatitis. A cancer which appears the day after the chemical exposure, on the other hand, does not, since from what is known there was not enough time to develop cancer. It was just such an incidence of logical temporal relationship between the Alcolac odor and physical discomforts given as history by the several plaintiffs to the physicians that prompted Dr. Emmett to diagnose that the exposure to the Alcolac chemicals was the cause:\n\n\"I think an example would be the ear, eye, nose and throat irritation, all the people, all -- or a large number of people relating that to the chemicals, what they perceive to be the chemical odor. . . . That is the basis on which I made those diagnoses.\"\n\nThese medical opinions assumed for purposes of diagnosis that no alternative point source [such as the Missouri Pacific Railroad operation] was a cause of the symptoms related by the histories of the several plaintiffs.\n\nThe two expert physicians for Alcolac, Emmett and Kerby, then proceeded to enter their separate diagnoses as to each plaintiff. Those renditions juxtaposed the subelements of the Carnow diagnosis with their own and explained any disagreement. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e52\u003c/span\u003e The diagnosis entered by Emmett and Kerby were attributed either to: Alcolac, Another Cause. Preexisting, Unknown. These opinions of diagnosis and etiology all issued on reasonable medical certainty. In the formulation of that medical opinion, the validity of the test procedures administered or conducted under the auspices of CCA was not usually in question. Nor was the integrity of the results. Emmett and Kerby did not equate an abnormal test result [one outside the reference range] with abnormal function. They came to determination of etiology and cause of a given bodily condition, rather, from the clinical significance of the test results considered together with occupational and medical history, and other such data.\n\nAlcolac was entered as the cause of the manifestations of eye, nose, throat and skin irritations described by the plaintiffs, based upon -- as Emmett and Kerby explained -- the histories given them by the plaintiffs and the validity of the temporal relationship between the cause and effect. There was disagreement in some cases whether the diagnosis of a given manifestation -- such as conjunctivitis, rhinitis or pharyngitis -- was properly chronic [as entered by Carnow as to some of the plaintiffs] or simply recurrent.\n\nAs to virtually every other manifestation of bodily damage, organ dysfunction or disease, the etiology Kerby attributed was Another Cause, Pre-Existing, or Unknown. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e53\u003c/span\u003e Thus the abnormal audiometric test results from which Carnow diagnosed hearing loss from toxic chemical damage to the 8th cranial nerve for numerous of the plaintiffs, Emmett and Kerby attributed to presbycusis, or occupational noise, or -- in one or two -- some pre-existent conductive loss. The sources for these opinions of non-Alcolac etiology were from the medical records and personal histories of the plaintiffs. They were often cited, but not elaborated. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e54\u003c/span\u003e No instance of male infertility or low sperm count was attributed to Alcolac. Those dysfunctions found in Daniel Pryor were simply attributed to Unknown. There was no porphyrin-related disease diagnosed in any of the plaintiffs, whatever the etiology, although Emmett acknowledged that 27 or the 31 plaintiffs tested outside the normal reference ranges. Nor was there any liver dysfunction or disease, or any other of the several manifestations subsumed under the Carnow diagnosis of chronic systemic chemical intoxication attributed an etiology other than to Another Cause, Pre-Existing, Unknown. Dr. Kerby acknowledged, however, that the attribution of etiology Unknown could included toxic chemicals.\n\nThe prognosis entered by Dr. Kerby for each of the plaintiffs was good, very good, or excellent, except for Mary Landon. Hers was guarded.\n\nVIII\n\nSubmissions, Verdicts, Judgments\n\nThe causes of action were ready for submission after eighty days of actual trial testimony. The litigation was originally brought as thirteen separate suits by thirteen family groups with a total of thirty-two suitors \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e55\u003c/span\u003e These suits were consolidated on the motion of the defendant Alcolac and over the objection of the plaintiffs. They were tried to the jury as a consolidated litigation. To facilitate review and argument by counsel to the jury of the mass of testimony [witness as well as technical] the trial court announced the design to submit each of the thirteen suits separately. The submission of the first of the plaintiff groups would include the general instructions [meant to cover all thirteen submissions] and the specific instructions as to that first plaintiff group submission. The arguments to the jury would follow, the returns of verdict as to that group, and entry of judgment. Counsel would be allowed full argument to the first plaintiff group submission, and limited argument as to each of the others in sequence.\n\nAlcolac objected to the submissions design on grounds that the intended method violated MAI and otherwise imposed undue burdens on posttrial motion and appeals procedures, and on the jury. Alcolac sought, and had the writ of this court to prohibit the trial Judge from implementation of that design. In consequence, the thirty-one claims for personal injury and eleven claims for property damage were submitted and argued together. The jury awarded to each plaintiff on the claims for personal injury, $200,000 as compensatory damages and $1,387,096.70 as punitive damages. There were separate awards returned for the property damage. Alcolac moved for judgment notwithstanding the verdicts or, alternatively, for new trial. The trial court denied judgment n.o.v., but granted a new trial as to damages only as to each of the thirty-one personal injury verdicts.\n\nOn the issue of compensatory damages the formal order recited as ground for new trial that the return of an identical $200,000 verdict for each plaintiff was\n\nimpermissible as a matter of law. . . and are inconsistent with and irreconcilable to each other, when viewed in context with all of the evidence favorable to the thirty-one plaintiffs\n\nOn the issue of punitive damages the formal order recited as ground for new trial, inter alia, that\n\nhe aggregate amount of the punitive damages awarded exceeds by almost three times the net worth of the defendant, and thus is impermissible as a matter of law because such verdicts have the effect of confiscating property without due process of law.\n\nThe memorandum opinion appended to the order made emphatic that the grant of new trial was not an exercise of the discretionary power of the court, but that these rulings rested \"on legal grounds alone\":\n\nSuch a Conclusion is not predicated on the sufficiency of the evidence or the weight thereof, but solely on the illogical nature of the verdicts as compared to the evidence and each other.\n\nAlcolac appeals from the grant of a new trial on the issues of compensatory and punitive damages for personal injury and from the denial of judgment notwithstanding verdicts on the claims of all of the plaintiffs. The plaintiffs appeal from the grant of a new trial on the issues of compensatory and punitive damages and seek reinstatement of the verdicts as rendered by the jury.\n\nPART TWO\n\nThe Alcolac Appeal on the Negligence Causes of Actions\n\nAlcolac seeks alternative relief on appeal: entry of judgment notwithstanding the verdicts for failure of plaintiffs to prove submissible negligence and nuisance causes of action, or remand of the consolidated cases for new trial on all issues, rather than merely for damages on the negligence causes of action as ordered by the trial court.\n\nThe plaintiffs framed recovery on two theories, negligence and nuisance. One theory was that the negligence of Alcolac caused injury to the persons of the plaintiffs. The other theory was that the unreasonable use of its property by Alcolac caused injury to the property of the plaintiffs. Alcolac insisted at the trial, and insists now on appeal, that there was no competent proof that either any injury to the persons of the plaintiffs or to their property was caused by Alcolac. Actionable negligence requires competent proof that the injury for which the damages are sought was caused by the defendant. Virginia D. v. Madesco Inv. Corp., 648 S.W.2d 881, 886[4,5] (Mo. banc 1983). Actionable private nuisance imposes a like proof of causation. Fuchs v. Curran Carbonizing and Engineering Co., 279 S.W.2d 211, 219[16,17] (Mo. App. 1955).\n\nThe dominant theme of the trial was the claim that Alcolac negligence caused biological disease and dysfunction to the plaintiffs. The proof of causation in the negligence cause of action, therefore, although somewhat coincident with the proof of that element in the private nuisance [unreasonable interference with the enjoyment of property] claim, requires a more extensive and intricate proof. It subsumes the other. For that reason, we address only the contention that judgment notwithstanding the verdicts must be entered because there was no competent proof that Alcolac negligence caused the biological conditions the plaintiffs describe in the evidence. Our response to this contention as to the negligence cause of action determines the validity of the submission of the nuisance cause as well.\n\nActionable negligence is proven by evidence of a legal duty on the defendant to protect the plaintiff from injury, failure of defendant to perform the duty, and injury to the plaintiff caused by such neglect. Hoover's Dairy, Inc. v. Mid-America Dairymen, 700 S.W.2d 426, 421[1,2] (Mo. banc 1985). The plaintiffs pleaded a duty owed them by Alcolac not to store, emit, dump or otherwise dispose of toxic chemicals, wastes, pollutants or contaminants which they reasonably knew or should have known would cause harm to the plaintiffs, and rather, to contain these toxic contaminants and pollutants in a reasonable manner, or warn adjacent dwellers of these activities so that they could take protection against them. The plaintiffs pleaded breaches by Alcolac of the duty to protect them from injury, and pleaded also the incurrence of personal injury to them caused by the breach of the duty. Alcolac does not contend that it was under no duty to protect the plaintiffs from harm, nor that the evidence does not prove prima facie breaches of that duty. Alcolac confines the assertion for judgment notwithstanding the verdicts to the contention that negligence was not submissible because there was no evidence that any breach of duty caused bodily injury to any plaintiff. That is to say - that cause in fact between any Alcolac conduct and damage to any plaintiff was not proven.\n\nI\n\nA\n\nJudgment Notwithstanding the Verdicts\n\n1.\n\nThe Issue of Causation in Fact\n\nThe Principles\n\nAn essential element of the proof of a cause of action for negligence, or any other tort, is that there be some reasonable connection between an act or omission of the defendant and the damage the plaintiff has suffered. This connection is the \"causation in fact\" of the damage. Prosser and Keeton, The Law of Torts § 41 [Fifth ed. 1984]. The proof of the causation in fact element in a toxic tort case is distinctively different from that in the traditional action for personal injury. In the conventional paradigm, A is struck and injured by the vehicle of B - the injury follows upon impact. In such a case, the cause is a single definable event and the effect is direct, immediate and observable. The connection in fact between the conduct of the defendant and the injury to the plaintiff is readily deducible, and thus not usually a matter of dispute. A typical toxic tort case, on the other hand, involves a claim of personal injury related to harm from exposure to a toxic substance - usually a chemical. The exposure is typically chronic and repeated, the injury is not from trauma or acute toxic response but from genetic or biochemical disruption, and manifests only after a long period of latency. Ayers v. Jackson Tp., 525 A.2d 287, 301 (N.J. 1987); Gold, Causation in Toxic Torts: Burdens of Proof, Standards of Persuasion, and Statistical Evidence, 96 Yale L.J. 376 (1986). The cancer and other diseases manifested from exposure to toxic agents, moreover, are found to occur at background levels in other segments of the population, even without apparent cause. Black \u0026 Lilienfeld, Epidemiologic Proof in Toxic Tort Litigation, 52 Fordham L. Rev. 732, 744 (1984). The latency factor as well as the background incidence of the disease the claimant attributes to the toxic agent engender a causal indeterminancy which hampers the ability to isolate the substance which induced the injury. Allen v. United States, 588 F. Supp. 247, 404 et seq. [60] (D. Utag 1984), rev'd on other grounds, 816 F.2d 1417 (10th Cir, 1987); cert. denied, U.S. , 108 S.Ct. 694 (1988); Harris, Toxic Tort Litigation and the Causation Element: Is There Any Hope of Reconciliation, 40 Sw. L.J. 909, 912 (1986). Thus, the logical model of a single definable cause and a direct, immediate and observable [and hence, determinate] effect that suffices to prove cause in fact in the traditional tort cause of action does not suit the toxic tort explanandum.\n\nA tort claimant must nevertheless prove a factual connection between the conduct of the defendant and the injury or suffer adverse judgment. Our law regards conduct as cause in fact [otherwise, legal cause] of harm if \"the jury would not have occurred in the absence of the negligent act\" [Dintelman v. McHalffey, 435 S.W.2d 633, 636[1,2] (Mo. 1968)], or, alternatively, if the conduct \"is a substantial factor in bringing about the harm\" [Ricketts v. Kansas City Stockyards Company of Maine, 484 S.W.2d 216, 221[4-6] (Mo. banc 1972)]. The \"but for\" rule [which Dintelman and a strand of our decisions employ as the test of causation in fact] is by function a rule of exclusion and as such \"serves to explain the greater number of cases.\" Prosser and Keeton, The Law of Torts § 41, at 266 [Fifth ed. 1984]. There is, however, one type of situation in which it fails: \"If two causes concur to bring about an event, and either one of them, operating alone, would have been sufficient to cause the identical result, some other test is needed.\" Id. The substantial factor test is the response. In the operation of this principle, \"'substantial' the fact that the defendant's conduct has such an effect in producing the harm as to lead reasonable men to regard it as a cause.\" Giles v. Moundridge Milling Co., 351 Mo. 568, 173 S.W.2d 745, 750[6-8] (1943); Restatement (Second) of Torts § 431, comment a (1965). Our law adopts the scope Restatement (Second) of Torts § 432(2) accords the substantial factor principle:\n\nIf two forces are actively operating, one because of the actor's negligence, the other not because of any misconduct on his part, and each of itself is sufficient to bring about harm to another, the actor's negligence may be found to be a substantial factor in bringing it about.\n\nGiles v. Moundridge Milling Co., 173 S.W.2d at 750; Chism v. White Oak Feed Company, Inc., 612 S.W.2d 873, 881 (Mo. App. 1981). The substantial factor rule is acknowledgment of the reality that, in the usual course, \" event without millions of causes is simply inconceivable; and the mere fact or causation, as distinguished from the nature and degree of the causal connection, can provide no clue of any kind to singling out those which are to be held legally responsible.\" Prosser and Keeton, The Law of Torts at 266.\n\nThus, although our law requires proof of cause to recover in tort, it does not require proof of a single cause. The substantial factor standard - which ascribes liability to a cause which has played an important part in the production of the harm, even though the harm may have occurred absent that cause - is particularly suited to injury from chronic exposure to toxic chemicals where the sequent manifestation of biological disease may be the result of a confluence of causes. Allen v. United States, 588 F. Supp. at 418; Basco v. Sterling Drug Co., 416 F.2d 417 (2d Cir, 1969); Gold, 96 Yale L.J. 391; Harris, 40 Sw. L.J. 911; M. Dore, Law of Toxic Torts, Environmental Law Series, § 24.02 (1982).\n\nA toxic tort plaintiff, as any other, bears the burden to prove the facts essential to a prima facie case. MAI III 3.00 [1987]. The plaintiff also bears the risk of nonpersuasion and must show by a preponderance, or greater weight, of the evidence that the injury was the result of the negligence of the defendant. Ledkins v. Missouri-Kansas-Texas Railroad Company, 316 S.W.2d 564, 568[5] (Mo. 1958); Rexford v. Philippi, 337 Mo. 389, 84 S.W.2d 628, 632[5] (1935). The greater weight of the evidence does not mean evidence which engenders certainty in the trier of fact, but which - \"when the last word has been spoken in the trial of a case\" - prompts a greater probability of confidence in the evidence of one party over the other. Brown v. Sloan's Moving and Storage Company, 274 S.W.2d 310, 313 (Mo. 1954); Miller v. Watkins, 355 S.W.2d 1, 2[1-3] (Mo. 1962); Kenney v. Henson, 107 S.W.2d 947, 952[1] (Mo. App. 1937). \" standard of proof represents an attempt to instruct the factfinder concerning the degree of confidence our society thinks he should have in the correctness of factual Conclusions for a particular type of adjudication.\" In re Winship, 397 U.S. 358, 370 (1969) [Harlan, J. Concurring]. The probability which induces the verdict of the jury in favor of one party over the other, therefore, is not a mathematical value, but a state of confident belief.\n\nAlcolac does not dispute that it owed a duty to the population in the environs to protect them against the hazards from the careless release into the environment of toxic pollutants and other residues of their production process. That was the very purpose of the systems of filtration, scrubbers, incinerators and other environmental control devices the plant design intended. Nor does Alcolac genuinely dispute that the evidence suffices to protect the plaintiff-members of the population in the environs from that risk of harm. The replete evidence - of a liquid incinerator which only partially consumed the toxic contaminants so that countless pyrolysis compounds of equal or more toxic effect were expelled into the atmosphere, of the recurrent diversion of the toxic stream around the filtration system directly into the bioponds so that the contaminants evaporated into the atmosphere, of the habitual overload of the bioponds with the organic wastes from the monomer process so that the contaminants [toluene, methyl chloride and epichlorohydrin, among others] were borne into the ambient air so as to expose the persons in the environs to these toxicants throughout the eight-year course of Alcolac operations - suffices prima facie to prove breach of duty.\n\n2.\n\nThe Issue of Causation in Fact\n\nThe Argument\n\nAlcolac insists, rather, that the actions for negligence were not submissible because causation in fact was not proven as a matter of law, in particular, that there was no competent proof that:\n\n1. any plaintiff ever inhaled, ingested or absorbed any injury-causing substance emitted from the Alcolac premises\n\n2. Alcolac ever emitted from its premises an injury-causing substance that injured any plaintiff\n\n3. any injury-causing substance was ever identified as emitted by Alcolac so as to injure any plaintiff\n\n4. the times or duration of time when any plaintiff inhaled, ingested or absorbed any injury-causing substance were ever identified\n\n5. the amount of any injury-causing substance inhaled, ingested or absorbed by any plaintiff was ever identified\n\n6. any act or omission of Alcolac ever caused injury to any plaintiff\n\n7. any act or omission of Alcolac was ever linked or connected to any injury of any plaintiff.\n\nAlcolac argues urgently that since modern life exposes everyone to countless chemicals and other toxic residues from diverse sources, a plaintiff who claims injury from such an exposure must identify the particular substance which caused the injury, as well as the source. Alcolac acknowledges that circumstantial proof of cause suffices, but argues that the evidence presented by the plaintiffs, however massive, was not sufficiently probative to interstice that element essential to recovery. That argument says that no lay, scientific or medical evidence identified an \"injury-producing substance or emission,\" or the person responsible for such substance or emission, or that the etiology of any bodily condition claimed by any plaintiff was attributable to Alcolac.\n\nAlcolac comes to the view of the uselessness of the plaintiffs' evidence on the premise that proof of causation \"requires not only proximity in time, but also a showing that plaintiff would not have been injured but for defendant's megligence.\" That, as we note, is the standard of causation our law expects in the greater number of cases where the cause is a single identifiable event and the effect is direct, immediate and observable. In such cases, the law insists on particularistic evidence of causation. Dintelman v. McHalffey, 435 S.W.2d at 636[1,2]. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e56\u003c/span\u003e In this case, as the evidence shows, the event was not single, but an exposure recurrent over as long as eight years, and some of the effects, the experts say [increased risk of cancer, continued deterioration of the body organs and of the immune system], remain latent. Also, genetic and other causes may impinge so that particularistic evidence of a cause in close temporal relationship with the effect is beyond the plaintiffs to muster. In a word, the chronic nature of the conduct of the toxic polluter - Alcolac - and the indeterminacy that the toxic pollution was the exclusive source of the disease prevent such a plaintiff from the proof that but for the Alcolac conduct the bodily injury would not have eventuated. Rosenbery, The Causal Connection in Mass Exposure Cases: A \"Public Law\" Vision of the Tort System, 97 Harv. L.Rev. 851, 855 (1984).\n\nThe but for formula, no less than substantial factor, is as much an expression of legal policy as of factual quantum. Prosser and Keeton, The Law of Torts § 41, at 256 (Fifth ed. 1984); Harris, 40 Sw L.J. at 952. The traditional and foremost policy of the tort law is to deter harmful conduct and to ensure that innocent victims of that conduct will have redress. Cognate principles of equity and economic efficiency also inform that policy: that the costs of the pervasive injury which result from mass exposure to toxic chemicals shall be borne by those who can control the danger and make equitable distribution of the losses, rather than by those who are powerless to protect themselves. Elmore v. Owens-Illinois, Inc., 673 S.W.2d 434, 438 (Mo. banc 1984); Morrow v. Caloric Appliance Corporation, 372 S.W.2d 41, 54 (Mo. banc 1963). The formulas of causation in fact are means to those ends and accommodate the stringencies of evidence to the policy they subserve. In that sense, causation in fact interdepends with duty, breach of duty and proximate cause. See Zafft v. Eli Lilly and Co., 676 S.W.2d 241 (Mo. banc 1984); Keener v. Dayton Electric Manufacturing Company, 445 S.W.2d 362, 364 (Ml. banc 1969); Howarth, Causation and the law, 96 Yale L.J. 1389, 1419 (1987); G. Calabresi, Concerning Cause and the Law of Torts: An Essay for Harry Kalver, Jr., U. Chi. L. Rev. 43, 69 et seq. (Fall 1975).\n\nAlcolac argues cause in fact - not in the context of operational practices which virtually precluded evidence to an injured suitor - but in terms of lack of essential proof that very evidence would have enabled. It was evidence of a state of the art system of toxic waste control and disposal mismanaged by untrained personnel and by operating procedures left undefined. It was evidence of recurrent toxic spills vented into the atmosphere, but unrecorded so that the quantity, identity and dates of those exposures cannot be known. It was evidence of toxic waste from the monomer process diverted from the decontamination procedure and expelled, still toxic, into the bioponds for evaporation into the air - without record or other note of these recurrent events. It was evidence of a liquid incinerator, designed to consume particulate toxic wastes, but which so malfunctioned as to be declared a \"hundred percent failure\" by the Alcolac management - but continued in use for more than two years so that countless, unidentified, unmeasured and unrecorded emissions of toxic compounds were released into the atmosphere. It was evidence of an agreement by Alcolac with DNR [May 30, 1980], but never honored, to install monitors on the monomer stacks to identify and measure the emissions for each product - so that the record intended by the regulatory agency never took form. Thus, the but for proof Alcolac insists upon the toxic tort plaintiffs [even were such a proof otherwise open to them] was made impossible by the very conduct of the defendant. These neglectful, even heedless, business and production practices, moreover, burden the plaintiffs in the proof that the Alcolac conduct was a substantial factor as a cause of their harm - that is to say: that the Alcolac conduct \"ha such an effect in producing the harm as to lead reasonable men to regard it as a cause.\" Giles v. Moundridge Milling Co., 1773 S.W.2d at 750[6.8]; Restatement (Second) of Torts §§ 431m 432 (1965).\n\nAlcolac, in any event, confounds the effect of its own evidence by the contention that no diagnosed injury bore that \"proximity in time\" to the emissions essential to the proof of a but for causation. It was the testimony of Alcolac expert Emmett that in environmental medicine cause and diagnosis are inextricable. A logical temporal relationship between the event and the biological effect, he explained, bears significantly to validate cause [or - in medical terms - etiology]. An irritant dermatitis which manifests the day after exposure [as was the case with several plaintiffs] is such a logical temporal relationship as to establish the exposure as the cause of the dermatitis. On the other hand a cancer - which invariably requires a long period of latency - which appears soon after exposure to the toxicants does not display a logical temporal relationship between cause and biological effect. It was the evidence that the plaintiffs were subjected to chronic exposure of the Alcolac emissions - some of them for as long as eight years. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e57\u003c/span\u003e The experts at the trial agreed with the other authorities on toxicology that: \"Chronic exposure to a toxic agent may produce immediate or acute effects with each administration in addition to the long-term, low-level, or chronic effects of the agent.\" Casarett and Douell's Toxicology 14 (2d ed. 1980).\n\nIt is not disputed in the evidence that, based upon the symptoms and history of complaints the plaintiffs reported to defense physicians Emmett and Kerby and the sequence between the incidents of recurrent exposure to the Alcolac odors and emissions and the manifestations of eye and upper respiratory irritations, these examiners assigned Alcolac as the cause. That is to say: the recurrent sequences of exposure to odors and the acute effects were in that \"proximity in time\" to constitute that but for nexus Alcolac insists on, between any tortious conduct and injury.\n\nAlcolac argues nevertheless that there was no competent evidence of causation - as to either acute or chronic effects - attributable to its operations. Alcolac insists that no competent evidence was adduced that Alcolac ever emitted any harmful substance any plaintiff ever inhaled or otherwise took into the bodily system, or ever caused any injury to any plaintiff. We consider that contention - as it impinges on the recurrent complaints of eye irritation, nose, throat and other upper respiratory ailments which manifested in that \"logical temporal relationship\" between exposure and effect expected as a validation of causation by Dr. Emmett - an issue conceded by the defense evidence. It was qualified by the proviso only that no source of the odors or emissions alternative to Alcolac be shown as the cause. That proviso, as our Discussion determines, was not established. The method of diagnosis employed by both Emmett and Kerby, it is to be understood, was the usual procedure they employed to reach medical cause - and hence diagnosis. It rested on the numerous histories to be sure, but also on information of the Alcolac production process, the toxicological profiles of the chemicals used, on the profuse medical records gathered by the plaintiffs, and the reports under the K.U. protocol. In short, as Dr. Emmett acknowledged: \"I made those diagnoses on the information that I reviewed\" - as well as the additional information given at the trial.\n\nA plaintiff who claims harm from exposure to a toxic substance bears the risk of nonpersuasion that the conduct of the defendant was a substantial cause of the injury. Basko v. Sterling Drug Co., 416 F.2d 417, 429[12] (2d Cir. 1969); Restatement (Second) of Torts § 432(2) (1965); Giles v. Moundridge Milling Co., 1773 S.W.2d at 750. In a toxic tort case, the cause in fact is a manifold proof: [1] an exposure to an identified harmful substance significant enough to activate disease [2] a demonstrable relationship between the substance and biologic disease [3] diagnosis of such disease in the plaintiff [4] expert opinion that the disease found in plaintiff is consistent with exposure to the harmful substance [5] defendant was responsible for the etiologic agent of the disease diagnosed in plaintiff. 2 Toxic Law Reporter (BNA) [hereinafter TXLR] 1040 (1988); M. Dore, Law of Toxic Torts § 24.03 (1987). The element of significant exposure to the harmful agent once established, the question becomes whether the pollutant [or other substance] can be demonstrated to cause the type of harm the plaintiff reports, and whether the harm did in fact result from the exposure. The diagnosis of disease induced by environmental factors [the biologic causation elements of causation in fact] is essentially a scientific undertaking, and so the burden of proof of causation the law imposes on a toxic tort plaintiff must be accommodated to the quality of evidence the scientific community deems sufficient for that causal link - if such a plaintiff may have recovery at all. Gold, 96 Yale L.J. at 384; Harris, 40 Sw L.J. at 945.\n\nAlcolac insists however that there was no competent proof that Alcolac ever emitted any injury-producing substance, or that any plaintiff ever took any such substance into the bodily system, or that any plaintiff ever identified any such substance, or the times and duration of exposure, or the dosage taken in - or that any Alcolac conduct ever caused injury to any plaintiff. That is to say: none of the elements of causation in fact were proven by competent evidence, and the cause of action was not submissible.\n\nIndeed, no witness - expert or lay - could identify the particular chemical at a particular exposure, the particular concentration of the chemical, the particular dosage of the chemical taken in bodily, or the particular duration of the exposures. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e58\u003c/span\u003e The direct proof of the identity of the toxic agents emitted by Alcolac over more than seven years, their measurements and frequency - which the defendant contends was essential to evaluate the role of those chemicals in the assessment of the claims of risk and injury - was evidence made unavailable by the insistent neglect of Alcolac to install monitors on the stacks and by the heedless, continued use of the liquid incinerator for more than two years after its malfunction. The lack of monitors at each single point source, a condition which continued up to the time of trial more than five years after the agreement with DNR to install them, deprived the plaintiffs of the identity of each chemical compound emitted, the concentration, and the frequency as well. Moreover, the imperfect incineration of the toxic waste from the malfunction not only distorted the identification of the compounds intended for destruction by that method, but also resulted in a profusion of pyrolysis products of unknown kind, quantity and toxicity.\n\nThe identity of the toxic substances to which the harm is attributed, however may be shown by circumstantial evidence. Roehling v. National Gypsum Company Gold Bond Building Products, 786 F.2d 1225, 1228[2,3] (4th Cir. 1986); Drayton v. Jiffee Chem. Corp., 395 F. Supp. 10081, 1087 (N.D. Ohio 1975), modified and aff'd, 591 F.2d 352 (6th Cir. 1978). The toxic compounds to which the plaintiffs attributed their diseases were epichlorohydrin, allyl alcohol, ethyl acrylate, toluene, glycidyl ether, cyclohexane, dimethyl sulfate, hydrogen sulfide, methyl chloride and allyl methacrylate. The average quantity of each of the first five of these chemicals used by Alcolac every year for seven years was also known and calculated. The quantity and kind of chemicals used in the monomer process varied from batch to batch, but these few were designated by the plaintiffs because of the many compounds used by Alcolac, the toxic profiles of these ten were well delineated. The evidence does not dispute that the chemicals in these quantities were used in the Alcolac production processes and that their wastes were intended for disposal in the environmental control systems installed in the plant. Nor was the evidence contradicted that the tests of the bioponds measured the footprints of epichlorohydrin in the form of breakdown products, of toluene and of methyl chloride - three of the compounds identified as factors of disease. The testimony of former Alcolac employees, as confirmed by the official spill log briefly maintained at the plant, also identify quantities of these chemicals spilled and then vented into the atmosphere, or simply routed directly into the bioponds without prior decontamination. Then also DNR investigators traced odors to spills of allyl alcohol on the Alcolac premises and emissions from other of these identified chemicals from that source. These circumstances in evidence sufficed to prove the identity of the toxic substances to which the plaintiffs attributed their injuries.\n\nAlcolac complains that measurements of the toxic agents lacked, and hence causation in fact of any injury was not proven. The most apt manner to measure concentrations of chemicals in the air is by the monitor. The personal monitor directly measures the contaminants in the air which the individual breathes. The efficacy of the personal monitor depends upon data from a study group. The monitor on a plume or stack [as intended by the May 1980 agreement between DNR and Alcolac] directly measures the emissions for each single point source. The efficacy of a stack or biopond monitor depends upon its installation. Office of Science and Technology Policy, Chemical Carcinogens: A Review of the Science and Its Associated Principles, 50 Fed. Reg. 10425 (Feb. 1985). A person subjected to chronic, long-term chemical exposures is not expected to foster a study group in order to gather evidence to prove liability for a disease not even anticipated. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e59\u003c/span\u003e An industrial polluter who refuses to make possible the measurement of the pollution - despite official obligation to that end - cannot complain that the measurement lacks. In any event, measurements of concentrations are useless as factors of exposure assessment without information of the identity of the chemicals measured, and Alcolac foreclosed that data. Allen v. United States, 588 F. Supp. at 425.\n\nThis lack of detail of exposure quantitation notwithstanding, the evidence agrees that the plaintiffs were exposed on sufficient occasions, for sufficient durations, in sufficient concentrations to toxic Alcolac chemicals to cause them recurrent [and even chronic] irritations and ailments to their eyes, skin and upper respiratory systems. There was other evidence, moreover, relevant to the proof of the frequency, duration and concentrations of exposure, of the effects of the emissions on the fauna and flora in the environs. The testimony of the residents in the Alcolac environs, plaintiffs and nonplaintiffs alike, of chemical residues on the gardens and trees, followed by decay and destruction - of visible physical effects of these emissions on the domestic animals and pets, of the fish kills in the waters mixed with the Alcolac effluents, all bore relevantly as circumstantial evidence of the frequency and recurrence of the episodes of emissions, as well as of concentrations sufficient to those effects. In this state of the evidence, testimony of the \"total adverse effects produced by the toxicant when administered continuously over a long period of time\" bears as circumstantial proof of causation. See J. H. Duffus, Environmental Toxicology 5 (1980); Hall and Silbergeld, Reappraising Epidemiology: A Response to Mr. Dore, 7 Harv. Envtl. L. Rev. 441, 445 (1983).\n\nAlcolac argues also that causation in fact was not proven because no competent evidence shows that \"any plaintiff ever inhaled, ingested or absorbed\" any injurious substance from the Alcolac source. We understand that argument to mean that, whatever the duration, concentration or frequency of any emission of toxicants by Alcolac, there was no evidence that any impinged on any of the persons of any of the plaintiffs so as to cause any of them injury. The evidence easily refutes that contention.\n\nThe odors generated by the Alcolac operation of its bioponds, liquid incinerator and production practices and their effects on nearby residents became matters of concern to the management virtually from the onset of activity. Operation commenced in May of 1978 and in June of 1978 Alcolac received complaints from nearby residents of vapors and haze over their properties. Among the complainants were the plaintiffs Phillips. WAPORA had been engaged to investigate this and other complaints... The vapors and haze were traced to the malfunction of the liquid incinerator. WAPORA engineer Boies came to the Phillips residence and apologized for those emissions. The citizenry became so disquieted by the persistent exposures to the vapors and haze generated by the liquid incinerator that WAPORA head Bregman was prompted to meet with them in public and reassure them that \"these things were going to be solved.\" The incidence of continued pollution prompted Bregman once again to meet with the citizenry, this time with an environmental committee, to reassure them that the air pollution problems would be resolved. The citizens, plaintiffs Landon, Phillips and others among them, continued to experience odors with consequent bodily discomforts and complaints, and continued to report them to Alcolac. At first, the management responded: Plant superintendent Fischer [a party defendant to the suit], his successor Sutton, his successor Aid, and even Alcolac president Anderson came to the home of plaintiffs Phillips to show concern. Those plaintiffs related the irritations to eyes and other bodily discomforts from the odors, vapors and foam. \"They promised to do something about it.\" The Phillips couple [later plaintiffs] complained personally to Anderson on four occasions, and as noted on their calendar, Anderson came to their home in response on April 2, 1981. They described the odors and the consequent physical effects to them. Anderson told them Alcolac \"w going to do something about it.\" Alcolac plant superintendent Fischer acknowledged complaints from the nearby residents of odors from the Alcolac premises, and confirmed them. He attributed them to low general oxygen levels in the ponds, as well as \"too much organic loading\" of the ponds.\n\nThe recurrent complaints from the Landons, Phillips and other citizens of odors and other emissions from Alcolac ultimately came to the attention of DNR. A regimen of inspections and surveillance was established as already fully recounted in the narrative of the evidence. Numerous citations issued to Alcolac for excessive off-premises emissions and numerous violations were determined. A number of the incidents were acknowledged by Alcolac but attributed to shifting carbon beds or other malfunction pleas to avoid sanction. The complaints became so numerous and recurrent that plant superintendent Sutton refused to acknowledge them further. The abatement agreement of May, 1980 was the result.\n\nThere is simply no color of validity to the contention that no incident of Alcolac emission of a substance that could impinge harmfully on any plaintiff was proven. Even after the abatement agreement, Sedalia police officer Rice - to whom complaints were then referred for more expedited attention - received twenty-three separate complaints of odors, all of which were investigated and led to Alcolac. Alcolac itself notified Nikkila of DNR to report spills in order to explain complaints of odors. There was testimony of repeated chemical spills during the monomer production process which were either vented into the atmosphere or flushed down the drain for discharge, still toxic, into the biopond. There they mixed with the soap effluents from the sulfonation plant. For the year 1981 - the only period for which a separate log was kept - 111 spills were recorded. There was testimony, however, that the vast number of spills went unrecorded. There was testimony of regular diversions of raw chemical waste from the decontamination process directly into the bioponds because of overloaded sumps. The chemical spills as well as the diverted waste included those compounds already identified in the monomer production process: allyl alcohol, toluene, glycidyl ether, epichlorohydrin, and the others. The toxic qualities and the effect on the human system of those compounds were as ascribed by the toxicology experts Legator, Schwartz and Carnow.\n\nThere was other evidence by plaintiffs and nonplaintiffs alike - stated, iterated and reiterated - of periodic \"foam storms\" when suds formations from the bioponds were seen transported through the air beyond the bounds of the Alcolac premises onto grounds in the vicinity. The foam was an admixture of the sulfonation and monomer effluents and so - according to industrial hygienist Boelter - transported the monomer contaminants to wherever they alighted. There was evidence that this process of untreated discharge created a \"soup\" of toxic chemicals in the bioponds which evaporated into the atmosphere. Toluene, methyl chloride and epichlorohydrin were identified by tests as among those toxicants contained in the bioponds - hence to which the plaintiffs were exposed. Blowers, the only environmental engineer ever employed by Alcolac, acknowledged that foam accumulated on occasion to a height of 15 to 20 feet, and when the wind arose, blew all about and onto the property of the Alcolac neighbors. The testimony of chemical operator Faulconer was to the same effect. Faulconer also described clouds of acid mist emitted from the sulfonation plant stack when the acid scrubbers malfunctioned - a frequent phenomenon - which irritated the skin on touch. There was other evidence of explosions which blew chemicals into the atmosphere and, at least on one occasion, material on nearby property. These were among the numerous incidents of emissions beyond the Alcolac premises the evidence describes.\n\nThe calendars of the plaintiffs Berry, Bradley, Elam, Phillips and Lawrence record repeated sightings of foam from Alcolac transported onto their premises. The accumulations were described as \"eleven feet high,\" \"eight feet high,\" \"as high as a refrigerator.\" The odors were \"terrible\" and the bodily effects upon contact were immediate. Mary Landon touched the foam and her skin blistered. Photographs of both the off-site accumulations of the foam were in evidence as well as of the physical consequences of contact with the substance. The odor, haze, smoke and foam phenomena were also described by nonplaintiff residents in the environs. The odors of the sulphur type, of rotten eggs, of septic or paint thinner they described, moreover, were the same off the Alcolac premises as on them where numerous residents had been on work or other occasions. Even momentary exposure to them, many related, resulted in irritation to the skin, mucous membrane, to the eyes, and even into the stomach. It was the testimony of Alcolac environmental medicine expert Emmett that the irritations to the skin, nose, eyes and throat experienced recurrently by the plaintiffs mean that the odors and fumes \"have contacted the surface tissues.\" Alcolac expert toxicologist Schwartz acknowledged that odors, fumes and vapors are \"at least markers of a chemical agent\" and, to the extent that the person has a symptom directly after exposure to the chemical agent, the \"temporality\" between the agent as cause and the symptom as effect is established. That is to say at very least, that a person who smells a chemical and thereupon feels its effect, is exposed to that chemical and impinged by it.\n\nNor, as Alcolac suggests, does Zafft v. Eli Lilly \u0026 Co., 676 S.W.2d 241 (Mo. banc 1984), require us to impose on those chronically exposed to toxic pollutants, unmeasurable because of the misconduct of the polluter, proof of the particular measurements of the chemical agents which caused their bodily injury as precondition to assessment of the risk of that exposure. That would only encourage the disregard of safe environmental practices and ensure escape from liability by simply flaunting official standards.\n\nIn any event Zafft treats the question of indeterminate defendant, not indeterminate measurement. Zafft, a products liability case, holds that a plaintiff may not maintain a cause of action in tort against a defendant the pleading cannot identify as an actor responsible for the substance which caused harm to the plaintiff. In Zafft, plaintiffs claimed injury from in utero exposure to DES, but were unable to identify the specific manufacturer from which they purchased the substance, so they joined as defendants all known manufacturers and distributors of the chemical substance from which DES derived. The plaintiffs argued a number of theories to sustain a recovery against the summary judgment entered on the pleading - among them, alternative liability, concert of action theory, market share liability, and its variant. Zafft rejected each of them in turn. Alternative liability was not applicable, because [676 S.W.2d at 244]: \"nlike the typical situation warranting application of alternative liability, all possible tortfeasors are not before the court and the actual wrongdoers may escape liability.\" The concert of action theory was rejected by Zafft as a basis for liability because the required element of agreement among the alleged wrongdoers lacked. The market share liability notion was rejected because that theory [id. at 246] \"continues the risk that the actual wrongdoer is not among the named defendants.\"\n\nHere, as our fuller Discussion concludes, Alcolac was the only reasonably possible point source of the pollution to which the plaintiffs were exposed - hence Alcolac was the only reasonable possible tortfeasor of the injury the plaintiffs claim, and Alcolac is before the court. Zafft rejects market share liability for reasons of policy as well: The theory functions to shift the burden to each defendant to exonerate itself as a cause of the injury the plaintiffs claimed. The relinquishment of the \"identification [of the defendant] requirement\" would mean abandonment of the fundamental concept of law [id. at 247]:\n\n\"the requirement that a plaintiff prove, at a minimum, some nexus between wrongdoing and injury.\"\n\nZafft reaffirms the policy that a plaintiff who seeks recovery in tort against one joined as a defendant must identify that defendant as an actor in the production of the harm for which the plaintiff seeks recovery. To require the defendant to exonerate itself as a producer of the harm in very effect is to shift the burden of proof on causation in fact to the defendant, a choice of policy Zafft was not ready to adopt. Zafft rejects market share liability for other reasons of policy as well: The theory functions to allow recovery against a defendant named, but not identified as an actor in the production of the harm for which the plaintiff seeks recovery, and allows escape from liability only to the defendant who exonerates itself as a producer of the harm. To require a defendant to exonerate itself in very effect is to shift the burden on causation in fact to the defendant, a choice of policy Zafft was not ready to adopt. The court chose to keep intact that \"so fundamental a concept of tort law\" that [id. at 247]:\n\n\"a plaintiff prove, at a minimum, some nexus between wrongdoing and injury.\"\n\nHere, the plaintiffs do not ask to be relieved of the obligation to prove \"some nexus between wrongdoing and injury.\" They do not seek that Alcolac carry their burden of proof on the causation element of the cause of action, nor recovery against a defendant not identified as an actor in the production of the harm they claim to their persons and property. They ask only that we accept their evidence - the only evidence available to them - under usual principles of circumstantial proof. Prosser and Keeton, on The Law of Torts § 41 (5th ed. 1984). Here, also [as our fuller Discussion shows] Alcolac was not only an identified tortfeasor, but the only reasonably possible point source of the pollution to which the plaintiffs were exposed - hence Alcolac was the only reasonably possible tortfeasor of the injury the plaintiffs claim. Zafft does not bear on the validity of the evidence the plaintiffs adduced to prove these components of the cause in fact element of the negligence cause of action against Alcolac.\n\nThe accession by Alcolac medical examiners Emmett and Kerby that these episodes of chemical exposure were the cause of the recurrent [even chronic] dermal, eye and upper respiratory ailments of the plaintiffs was conditioned by the qualification that no alternative point source could reasonably account for the toxic emissions which induced those acute manifestations.\n\nA number of manufacturing and other plants were clustered in the Sedalia industrial area in some proximity to Alcolac. Missouri Pacific Railroad yards, Missouri Pressed Metals, DeLong Welding, Quality Fiberglass [where TV satellite dishes were manufactured] were the most prominent among them. Nikkila, staff director of air pollution control of the Missouri Division of Environmental Quality, Department of Natural Resources, identified the Missouri Pacific Railroad, DeLong and Quality Fiberglass as other point sources of emissions in the vicinity of Alcolac. He acknowledged that at no time during the past seven years was any complaint ever made as to any off-premises odors from any of these sources, nor from Missouri Pressed Metals. The complaints were of odors and emissions from Alcolac, and they were persistent and recurrent. They were complaints also of eye and skin irritations from these exposures. They came from the Elams, Landons, Lawrences, as well as from other citizens. It was the uniform testimony of the public officials as well that there had been no citizen complaints of odors or emissions or physical complaints from the operation of plants in the vicinity other than Alcolac - such as the Missouri Pacific Railroad yard, Missouri Pressed Metal and DeLong Welding. A very few of the witnesses noticed an occasional odor from Quality Fiberglass and other operations, but they were fleeting and of a different quality than those form Alcolac. There was no testimony from any witness - whether presented by the plaintiffs or defendant - that any off-premises odor from any source other than Alcolac ever brought on physical complaint or manifestation. It was the testimony of the witnesses, litigant and nonlitigant alike, that their symptoms, complaints came on after the Alcolac operations began in May of 1978, and that the eye, nose, throat and skin irritations were sequent upon the exposures to the odors and emissions.\n\nThe only point sources of emissions in the vicinity of the plaintiffs which used chemicals of some toxicity, or those which could induce any of their physical manifestations were Missouri Pressed Metals and Missouri Pacific Railroad. Missouri Pressed Metals used a solution of trichloroethane to remove grease from the bearings and bushings manufactured there. Tricloroethane evaporates very quickly and gives off the odor of alcohol. It has a very low toxicity but causes irritation to the eyes and irritation to the skin - symptoms many of the plaintiffs exhibited. The vapors of that chemical compound were vented into the air during the cleansing process. The residue was formerly collected in a drum, and then spread on the plant grounds as a weed-killer - a method of disposal the advisory from the manufacturer, Dow Chemical Company, deems safe. The residue is not transported away. These methods of venting of the vapors and occasional disposal have never been cited by OSHA, on the inspections, or DNR. There has never been complaint of any alcohol odor from any source, or that anyone has experienced any symptom or manifestation from any such exposure. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e60\u003c/span\u003e Missouri Pacific Railroad, as our narrative already explains, uses a thinner composed of 66 percent toluene in the sign shop operation of that facility. The thinner was identified by DNR as potentially hazardous because of the toluene content. Some 6,336 pounds of that compound are used per year, or about one-third of the annual use by Alcolac. Missouri Pacific disposed of that toxic waste by deposit into covered pits. It was the virtual unanimous evidence from the litigant and nonlitigant residents in the environs of Alcolac and of these plants - some of whom lived immediately adjacent to them - that there was no annoyance from odors or emissions from these and other industrial sources, but only from Alcolac. It was the actual unanimous evidence that no one experienced any bodily irritation from exposure to any odor or emission from any of these sources, other than Alcolac.\n\nIt was the expert opinion of Dr. Carnow that, the evidence just [and previously more fully] recounted assumed as fact, none of the manifestations of the diagnoses entered for the plaintiffs could be attributable to any of these industrial sources as the cause of their bodily disease, except only Alcolac. Nor does the evidence adduced by the defendant tender a basis for inference other than that Alcolac was the only point source of the toxicants to whose exposure the plaintiffs attribute their physical disease and injury. The evidence that the diseases found in the plaintiffs were attributable to Alcolac and not to any alternative source, therefore, was an element of the diagnoses entered by Dr. Carnow, and hence an issue submissible to the jury, and by the verdicts determined in favor of the plaintiffs. We take as proven, therefore, the accession of the Alcolac medical examiners Emmett and Kerby, that the recurrent [and in some cases, chronic] acute manifestations of eye, nose, throat and skin irritations suffered by the plaintiffs were the biological effects of the exposures to the Alcolac emissions. That is to say, we take as proven that Alcolac breached its duty to the plaintiffs to protect them against the risk of injury from harmful toxic emissions, and that the breach of that duty was the cause in fact of the acute biological effects of the recurrent exposures. The plaintiffs are entitled to damages and judgment for those injuries.\n\n3.\n\nThe Issue of Causation in Fact\n\nThe Alcolac contention remains, however, that - the acute bodily manifestations apart - there was no competent evidence that \"any act or omission of Alcolac ever caused or was ever linked or connected to any injury to any plaintiff.\" A plaintiff who sues for injury from exposure to toxicants, of course, must prove not only a demonstrable relationship between the toxicants and biological disease, but also that the disease diagnosed in the plaintiff is consistent with exposure to the toxicants. The relationship between toxicants and biological disease is a subject of toxicology, pharmacology and epidemiology. The diagnosis of disease in the plaintiff consistent with exposure to the toxicants is a subject of medicine, especially occupational and environmental medicine. Sterling v. Velsicol Chemical Corporation, F.2d , No. 86-6087, (6th Cir. August 29, 1988) (Westlaw Allfeds Database); B. Black and D. Lilienfeld, Epidemiologic Proof in Toxic Tort Litigation, 52 Firdham L. Rev. 732, 775 (1984).\n\nAlcolac does not argue that the precondition to the proof of biological causation was not met: that the toxicological experts for the plaintiffs, Legator and Carnow, did not demonstrate by valid scientific evidence that the particular contaminants \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e61\u003c/span\u003e [among the numerous other pollutants emitted] were capable of inducing the kind of diseases the plaintiffs claim as injury from the chronic exposure. There was agreement among all these experts [Alcolac toxicologist/pharmacologist Schwartz as well] that these chemicals were organ specific as well as systemic: that they all not only attacked target organs, but also had propensity to damage multiple organ systems. There was agreement of their portals of entry into the biological system and that the organs affected were the liver, kidney, respiratory system, central and peripheral nervous systems, and the heart - among others. There was agreement as well that, among the chemicals, epichlorohydrin, dimethyl sulfate and toluene are carcinogens - although the Alcolac experts considered that not conclusively proven among human populations. [Alcolac expert Schwartz gave opinion, in addition, that methylene chloride was also a carcinogen to humans and glycidyl ether possibly so.] There was agreement also that epichlorohydrin, allyl alcohol, dimethyl sulfate and methylene chloride are mutagens. There was also agreement that epichlorohydrin and dimethyl sulfate, among them, are alkylating agents - compounds which attack protein and kill cells. Chemicals of that ilk, immunologists Zahalsky and Strechschulte agreed, act to alter DNA and to kill new cell formations, and to suppress the immune system. Methylene chloride, Alcolac expert Schwartz added, also acts to suppress the immune systems.\n\nNor does Alcolac on this appeal contend that certain of the organ dysfunction and disease the plaintiffs attribute to the exposure - or the epidemiologic and other scientific sources the experts allude to as ground for opinion - were not of the kind caused by the chemicals emitted by Alcolac. Nor is it disputed on this appeal that the Alcolac chemicals can cause chemical hepatitis, peripheral polyneuropathy, abnormal muscle metabolism and other dysfunctions the plaintiffs relate to the exposure. It was also a matter of acknowledgment by both of the immunologists - Stechschulte for Alcolac and Zahalsky for the plaintiffs - that toxic chemicals of the kind emitted by Alcolac can adversely affect the immune system and that the condition, chemically-induced immune disregulation, may result.\n\nThere was disagreement nevertheless between the cadres of experts for the plaintiffs and Alcolac that these chemicals caused the kind of organ disease and dysfunction diagnosed in some of the plaintiffs. The Alcolac experts - toxicologists and physicians alike - did not agree that any of the eleven chemicals identified with the plant production and disposal processes caused biological consequences such as damage to the 8th cranial nerve, the testicular function in males, or the porphyrin metabolism function of the liver. Thus, they did not agree that the loss of hearing from nerve damage diagnosed in twenty of the thirty-one plaintiffs, or the sperm abnormality diagnosed in all seven of the male plaintiffs who submitted to the analysis or the abnormal porphyrins diagnosed in twenty-seven of the plaintiffs were the kind of biological disease associated with exposure to these chemicals.\n\nThe opinions that toluene causes damage to the 8th cranial nerve, that toluene and epichlorohydrin affect the reproductive system, and that epichlorohydrin induces porphyria were rendered into evidence by toxicologists Legator and Carnow. The opinions rested on the results of animal studies related by Legator from the scientific literature. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e62\u003c/span\u003e The need for resort to animal studies to determine the effects - the witness explained, was the long latency period required for biological effects to manifest among human populations exposed to the toxins. The justification for reliance on the test results, Legator explained also, is the metabolic and pathological comparability between humans and the rodent species used for that purpose. Legator concluded: \"For the vast majority of chemicals we have to accept animal data and that has been stated by every regulatory agency, every international body I know of, our ability to get information on compounds that are actually human carcinogens is almost nil.\" \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e63\u003c/span\u003e The Alcolac experts disagreed with the opinions that toluene causes damage to the 8th cranial nerve, that toluene and epichlorohydrin affect the male reproductive system, and that epichlorohydrin induces porphyria, not for any reason of animal test invalidity, but because the dosages administered were at \"very high levels,\" and so the resultant pathology could not be extrapolated to humans exposed to chronic, but low level, concentrations.\n\nThese opinions were received in evidence. There is no contention by Alcolac on its appeal, or in response to the cross-appeal of the plaintiffs, that these opinions are incompetent to prove that the Alcolac chemicals are not capable of inducing the kind of disease the plaintiffs claim as injury from the chronic exposure - or, for that matter, even incompetent to prove that they were the biological cause in fact of those diseases diagnosed in the plaintiffs. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e64\u003c/span\u003e Alcolac argues, rather, that the diagnosis attributes to each plaintiff, chronic systemic chemical intoxication -- a disease medicine does not recognize - and the increased risk of cancer -- a disease our law does not compensate. In any event, Alcolac argues, the diagnoses were derived by a method pseudo-scientific at best and calculated to mislead. These, however, are contentions of trial error, and raised as such by Alcolac. They do not impinge on the merits of the judgment notwithstanding the verdicts.\n\n4.\n\nDisposition of the Motion for Judgment Notwithstanding the Verdicts\n\nThe evidence of causation -- as well as of breach of duty and biological damage -- was sufficient to prove prima facie the negligence causes of action against Alcolac. The motions for judgment notwithstanding the verdicts in the negligence causes of action were properly denied by the trial court.\n\nB.\n\nMotion for New Trial\n\nAlcolac argues also that if negligence was submissible, then there was error in the admission of expert opinion evidence, and witness evidence, in the formulations of the instructions, the comportment of the trial Judge, and other events which prejudiced the defendant and require a new trial. These points and expositions are diffuse, and we confine our responses so as to avoid the repetition the presentation invites.\n\n1.\n\nExpert Opinion Evidence\n\nAlcolac contends that the diagnosis entered for a disease medicine does not recognize and otherwise derived by an unscientific methodology. Alcolac describes the diagnosis as: chronic systemic chemical intoxication -- and, indeed, that term does not appear in the compiled International Classification of Disease. n.65 (footnote omitted) That term was not tendered as a definitive diagnosis however, but as a generic designation of convenience, rendered into a specific diagnosis by the particular manifestations of bodily disease and dysfunction of the individual plaintiff. The term collapses: \"chronic systemic chemical intoxication caused by epichlorohydrin, toluene [and the other identified Alcolac chemicals as impinged upon by the synergistic and pyrolysis effects] with damage to multiple organ systems, including [the listed manifestation of bodily disease or dysfunction of the individual plaintiff].\" [See Appendix M-1, M-2, M-3] The medical literature does recognize poisoning from each of the identified Alcolac chemicals. The opinions of all of the scientific experts - toxicologists, pharmacologists, immunologists, environmental medicine physicians and internists - agree that the Alcolac chemical toxins affected multiple organ systems. The liver, kidneys, central nervous system, and peripheral nervous systems were among the bodily functions assaulted by these chemicals. The immune system was also a target - particularly of those toxins with an alkylating quality. The monomer process, Dr. Carnow explained, requires chemicals \"which are very active in terms of their ability to destroy and damage and coagulate protein, which is what tissue is.\" The assessment that these chemicals function as systemic poisons and act avidly on tissue was an opinion shared by Alcolac expert Emmett. There was evidence also that the identified chemicals are metabolic poisons, and impede the activation function of the enzymes. The notion of \"systemic poisons\" and their effect to damage protein, therefore, is not the neologism of an expert - as the argument intimates - but textbook toxicology:\n\n\"Systemic poisons are typically organic compounds that interfere with the enzymatic reactions, oxygen metabolism, or neural functions. They do so by and large, by virtue of chemical resemblances to organic compounds normally found in animal cells, mostly proteins.\"\n\nToxic Chemicals, Health, and the Environment, 41 (L. Lave and A. Upton, eds. 1987) There is no contention that the several biological manifestations and dysfunctions ascribed as subdiagnoses of a particular plaintiff do not describe disease. Chemical hepatitis, porphyria, chronic chemical bronchitis, and the others are all recognized diseases. Even chemically induced immune dysfunction - challenged by the defense in the testimony of immunologist Zahalsky - was acknowledged as a medical diagnosis by Alcolac immunologist Stechschulte. There was ample evidence that chronic exposure to the Alcolac chemicals resulted in a chronic systemic intoxication to multiple organ systems of the plaintiffs, manifested the particular bodily disease and dysfunction described as to each.\n\n2.\n\nDiagnosis and Methodology\n\nThe validity of the diagnoses as recognized diseases notwithstanding, Alcolac argues that these medical opinions rest on evidence which was only scientific simulation and hence not trustworthy. Moreover, Alcolac argues, it was evidence so embossed with the authority of the expert as to convey a false aura of reliability and mislead the jury. The evidence to which Alcolac alludes is what it terms the \"frequency tables.\" They include the series of charts marked with the symptoms, \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e66\u003c/span\u003e physical examination results, \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e67\u003c/span\u003e laboratory test results, \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e68\u003c/span\u003e and diagnosis \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e69\u003c/span\u003e as to each plaintiff. They include also three summary tables: summary of symptoms, \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e70\u003c/span\u003e summary of abnormal physical findings, \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e71\u003c/span\u003e and summary of abnormal laboratory tests. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e72\u003c/span\u003e These charts are compilations of the results already derived from the interview, physical examination and laboratory test phases of the patient evaluations by Dr. Carnow at CCA. As compilations, the charts readily reflect the coincidence - or frequency of incidence - of symptoms, abnormal physical findings and abnormal laboratory test results among the thirty-one plaintiffs. It is to these \"frequency tables\" that the defendant addresses the contention of unreliable and deceptive evidence.\n\nIt is the Alcolac argument that the frequency tables \"were the foundation of plaintiffs' cases - used to prove both causation and injury - on which [Dr. Carnow's] entire testimony was based.\" Since they were derived by a methodology of only feigned scientific validity - the argument continues - both the summary exhibits as well as the medical opinions of diagnosis on which they rest should have been rejected by the trial court.\n\nWe respond at the outset that the summary exhibits were not tendered or received as proof of scientific fact or medical opinion, but only as visual aids to the understanding of the data already fully explained by the testimony of Dr. Carnow. The symptoms, abnormal physical findings and abnormal laboratory test results marked on the SYMPTOMS, PHYSICAL FINDINGS and LABORATORY charts of each plaintiff - in each case found by Dr. Carnow to a reasonable medical certainty to be the effects of the exposure to the Alcolac emissions - were then transposed to the SUMMARY OF SYMPTOMS, SUMMARY OF ABNORMAL PHYSICAL FINDINGS, and SUMMARY OF ABNORMAL LABORATORY TESTS charts. The summaries are merely compilations of the individual charts on those subjects. As such, they depict nothing not already fully explained and subserve, if nothing else, a convenient reference for witness testimony and jury understanding. The admission of the summaries as demonstrative evidence is a matter for the discretion of the trial court. The exhibits, which merely compiled data already explicated by witnesses and received in evidence, were relevant on the issue of the claim of injury and disease from exposure to the Alcolac chemicals and hence were admissible - if for no other reason. Fravel v. Burlington N. R.R., 671 S.W.2d 339, 342[1-2] (Mo. App. 1984) cert. denied, 469 U.S. 1159 (1985).\n\nUpon analysis, the subject of complaint is not the summaries as such, but the validity of the data they compile. Alcolac uses the medium of these exhibits to impugn as \"unscientific\" the method used by Dr. Carnow to attribute symptoms, abnormal physical findings, and abnormal laboratory test results to the individual plaintiffs. It is therefore, in very effect, a complaint that the diagnoses of disease in the plaintiffs [which derive from these findings] were not proper evidence. The argument as expounded assumes that the sum of the found symptoms, abnormal physical findings and abnormal test results is the diagnosis. It is a Conclusion contradicted by the testimony of Dr. Carnow who explained with emphasis that whether symptoms, or abnormal physical findings or abnormal laboratory test results connotes disease is a matter of medical diagnosis integrated from that and other relevant data - including host factors such as genetic preDisposition, nutrition and mode of life.\n\nAlcolac argues that the entries the summary tables compile fail to consider alternative risk factors such as smoking, alcohol use, age, family history - and other confounding variables related to exposure and effect. Nor, the argument continues, do the entries on the charts tell when any abnormality first appeared or for how long it persisted.\n\nThese contentions not only challenge the clear import of the evidence and again confuse prediagnosis procedures with diagnosis itself, but also misunderstand the methods of environmental medicine evaluation. It is the postulate of environmental medicine, Dr. Emmett as well as Dr. Carnow explained, that cause is cognate to diagnosis. It is for that critical reason, that to derive a reliable profile that a disease is the effect of an environmental cause, both environmental factors as well as the risk variables of the particular person afflicted must be established. The environmental factors, as our Discussion explains, encompass the entire pathway from toxic source to biological disease. They describe the gamut of causation from toxic source to exposure, identification of the toxins, the quantities, their toxicity to humans, the portals of entry into the human system and the biological end point of disease. These were shown by the evidence, direct and circumstantial, of the numerous lay and expert witnesses. The risk variables of the particular person afflicted relate to an assessment of whether the disease diagnosed was the result of the toxins or rather of viral origin, or of a genetic preDisposition, or other host factor, or to the mode of life. Those factors were meticulously delved at the interview which initiated the examination of each of the plaintiffs at CCA, and then related into the evidence as already described.\n\nThose entries on the individual charts which depended upon the evaluation of the clinician - such as symptoms given on the interview or abnormal physical findings detected on physical examination - were assessed by Dr. Carnow and entered on the charts as caused by Alcolac only after determination [the environmental factors considered] \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e73\u003c/span\u003e that the symptoms or abnormality was, to a reasonable medical certainty, a biologically expected effect of such an exposure to such a toxic agent. In the case of laboratory test results, which reflected objective values, the reference range governed whether the value found was normal or abnormal. A result outside the reference range was entered on the individual chart as an abnormal finding. Whether any symptom or abnormality connoted disease, Dr. Carnow explained, was a matter of medical diagnosis from the integrated data and assessment of the risk variables. It is only after other possible alternative causes of disease were eliminated that Dr. Carnow ascribed a true etiology. Thus, although immunologist Zahalsky determined from the several panels administered to the plaintiffs that they all suffered from systemic, progressive chemical intoxication so as to dampen their immune systems, the clinical diagnosis entered by Dr. Carnow on the integrated data for Kay Turley and John Phillips did not include immune system dysfunction.\n\nIt was this process of differential diagnosis that was applied to each plaintiff seriatim to derive that a disease or dysfunction was caused, or not caused, by Alcolac. It was by this process that the risk variables for the damage to the 8th cranial nerve - and consequent loss of hearing - were assessed to differentiate between a condition brought on by exposure to occupational noise and a loss of hearing from toxic exposure. In other instances, since preexistent diabetes impinges on the protein metabolism function of the liver, that factor was taken into account as a variable to eliminate the Alcolac chemicals as the cause of a manifestation of disease based on an abnormal test result of that a function. Hyperglycemia was distinguished from diabetes, on the other hand, to attribute that disease caused by malfunction of lipid metabolism to Alcolac. The synergistic or multiplicative susceptibility to disease of an alcohol or cigarette user exposed to toxins such as epichlorohydrin and the acrylates was also a risk variable taken into account in the process of diagnosis. It was because personal habit, nutrition, work, genetic and medical history bear so relevantly upon a valid assessment of diagnosis - and hence causation - that this data was so meticulously drawn from each plaintiff-witness.\n\nIt is simply disingenuous, therefore, for Alcolac to argue that the diagnoses entered by Dr. Carnow rested on \"overly simplistic summaries of complex issues - ith alternative risk factors [e.g., smoking, alcohol, age, medication] not taken into consideration.\" The diagnoses did not rest on the summary charts at all, but on the data they reflect, as transformed into a medical opinion through the toilsome process of differentiation of risk variables and the art of the clinician. It defeats fair response for Alcolac to insist otherwise.\n\nIt is valid to observe, as does Alcolac, that in terms of epidemiologic principle, age and gender are among the most significant variables in the identification and determination of causes of human disease. T. F. Pugh, Epidemiology, at 103 et seq. (1980). It is not valid to argue, however, as does Alcolac, that the frequency tables [actually, the diagnoses] do not take into account the age span among the thirty-one plaintiffs [from Lyle Turley at 9 and Virgil Bradley at 75] or the gender. The data upon which the diagnoses rest as well as the diagnoses actually entered expressly accommodate to the factors of age and gender - where significant. The reference ranges which defined the normal for a given procedure or laboratory test differed for male and female and age - where those factors were significant to the test. The immune panels - as is the universal procedure [except under the K.U. protocal] - qualify the published reference ranges by those factors. The cholesterol test results were defined that way, as were the numerous components of the genitourinary, liver metabolism and other organ function tests. It was for the very reason that the T cell population, as an absolute number, varies with age that immunologist Zahalsky segregated the plaintiffs into three age groups - the young, the intermediates, and the older - to enable valid analysis of immune system dysfunction. In the derivation of medical diagnosis from the laboratory and other data Dr. Carnow repeatedly accounted for the age and, where relevant, the gender of the plaintiff. Thus, he discounted as not significant to diagnosis of disease in eleven-year-old Amber Cross the elevated alkaline phosphatase test value [usually an indication of enzyme liver metabolism dysfunction] because that was characteristic of the youth growing-process.\n\nAlcolac condemns as \"pseudo-scientific flim-flam\" not only the summary charts [diagnoses[ but the method of reference ranges which allow for only two results - \"'normal' and 'abnormal,' ignoring all degrees\" and which omits from the data of diagnosis \"the time a particular abnormality may have first appeared or for how long it persisted.\" This argument is full of ambivalence.\n\nAlcolac simply refuses to accept what all of the scientific witnesses - for the plaintiffs and Alcolac alike - understood: a reference range used by a laboratory represents a statistically significant normal derived from tests done on masses of population so that chance is not a likely explanation for a test result which falls within the range. In terms of diagnosis, the medical witnesses - Carnow, Emmett and Kerby - agreed that a test result outside the reference range must be considered an abnormal test value, but does not by that fact necessarily connote disease. Neither Emmett or Kerby found any cause to doubt the integrity of the tests administered to the plaintiffs, or the reference ranges, or the results [except for the first run of prothrombin time], or the need for them. They disputed only the diagnoses. Emmett and Kerby concluded that, as a clinical matter, the test results, however abnormal, did not [except for the acute effects] signify disease - or if they did, the conditions were not attributable to Alcolac but to other causes. Contrary to the Alcolac argument, also, in the rendition of diagnosis, Dr. Carnow sometimes gave significance to degrees of test values - those, although barely within or without the reference range, where the particular result was a significant departure from the median.\n\nAlcolac argues most ambivalently when it berates Dr. Carnow, on the one hand, for the \"arge numbers of medical tests on many people virtually guarantee getting many 'abnormalities'\" and, on the other hand, for the lack of test results \"as to when the 'abnormalities' first appeared or for how long they persisted.\" That is to say: there were too many needless tests applied and too few necessary ones neglected. The testimony of the Alcolac medical experts belie those assertions. The laboratory tests administered to the plaintiffs proceeded under a protocol developed by Dr. Carnow to test those organs and organ functions known to be the biological targets of the chemicals used and emitted by Alcolac. The number and kind of laboratory tests administered to a plaintiff were governed by the nature of the symptoms, physical findings and related diagnostic incidents of the particular evaluation. This enabled an informed selection of laboratory tests among the thousand available for the various organs. They ranged in number from 25 for the youths, Amber Cross and Lyle Turley, to 63 for Carl Berry. There was not suggestion or even insinuation that any of these tests were mock procedures, or for any purpose of trumpery. The tests of the liver, an organ targeted by virtually all of the toxins identified in the evidence, were for the most part organ and function specific. They tested the integrity of phases of the metabolism, excretion and synthetic functions of that organ. The tests Alcolac expert Kerby described for the integrity of the liver cells and function were those administered under the CCA protocol. The tests for the hearing, male reproductive, heart, genitourinary and other functions were those usually administered for purposes of diagnosis. Neither Kerby nor Emmett doubted the validity of the choice of those procedures, or of the laboratories which administered them, or even of the results - except, once again, for the first run of prothrombin time.\n\nIt was the evidence that, as a practical matter, the number, kind and frequency of laboratory tests were constrained by considerations of inconvenience and cost. A number of the procedures cause pain - such as the tests for the motor and sensory nerve responses to determine damage to the peripheral nervous system. Another, causes embarrassment - the production of a specimen for sperm analysis. They are also expensive. The cost of an immune panel was $1000. To the cost of the laboratory services must be added the expense of the diverse specialists who conduct the evaluation interviews, collate the symptomology, the neuropsychological tests for central nervous system damage, and the cadre of other clinicians, consultants, scientists and staff - all of whom had a necessary role in the accumulation of the prediagnosis data. The extravagant cost to a plaintiff for the laboratory tests, the technical experts and evidence indispensable to the prima facie proof of the involved cause in fact issue in a toxic tort litigation, is a matter of notice and concern for its access to the courts implications. See Note, A Suggested Remedy for Toxic Injury: Class Actions, Epidemiology and Economic Efficiency, 26 Wm. \u0026 Mary L. Rev. 497, 515 (1985); Harris, 40 Sw. L. J. at 949 (1986). \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e74\u003c/span\u003e There is simply no basis in the evidence to support the Alcolac contention that the results depicted on the SUMMARY OF ABNORMAL LABORATORY TESTS chart were without reliability or validity because they represent data from too many or too few procedures. The data the chart compiles, rather, were the results of laboratory procedures acknowledged as both necessary and valid for tests of disease to the organs normally affected by exposure to the identified chemicals. Accordingly, the compiled data the summary charts represent were relevant to he issues on trial and the exhibits were properly admitted. Carddock v. Greenberg Mercantile, 297 S.W.2d 541, 547[3-12] (Mo. 1957). Also, Dr. Carnow derived the medical diagnoses by a method scientifically acceptable and by evidence probative and legally valid.\n\n3.\n\nCompetency of Medical Opinion on \"Nonmedical\" Causation\n\nAlcolac not only argues that the medical diagnoses entered for the plaintiff were derived from unreliable data evaluated by an unscientific method, but also that Dr. Carnow was allowed to render opinion \"in the non-medical field of liability causation\" - an opinion he was not qualified to give. Liability causation, as Alcolac uses the term, means not an opinion that chemicals had injured the plaintiffs, but that \"it was defendant's chemicals which had done so.\" Alcolac acknowledges that Dr. Carnow was presented as qualified in six separate medical fields, and so was competent to give diagnosis as a medical expert that the injuries were caused by chemicals. Alcolac contends, however, that Dr. Carnow was not presented or qualified as a \"non-medical expert,\" and hence his opinion that Alcolac was the source of the pollution to which the plaintiffs were exposed and the cause of the acute and chronic effects their bodily systems manifested was incompetent.\n\nIt is clear, however, that Dr. Carnow was received as an expert in toxicology and epidemiology, as well as in several medical fields, and Alcolac has never contended that the witness was not qualified to render opinion on those \"non-medical\" subjects. Alcolac intimates, nevertheless, that the matter of pollution source was sufficiently one of common experience and sense as to render the opinion of an expert an invasion of the jury function. The determination of pollution source involves not only the science of industrial hygiene, but also of toxicology, meteorology, and even ambient air modeling. The validation of source, moreover [as experts for both litigants greed], involves the determination of whether the chemicals emitted by the source were of the kind that reasonably explained the physical effects manifested by those exposed to them. That is a matter of toxicology and pharmacology, and not of common sense and everyday experience. It is a subject with which the ordinary juror is not likely to be conversant, and so one where the opinion of the expert serves to enable the trier of fact to understand the evidence. Wessar v. John Chezik Motors, Inc., 623 S.W.2d 599, 602[1] (Mo. App. 1981). In such a case, it is no valid objection that the expert testifies on the ultimate issue to be decided by the jury, or that such opinion invades the province of the jury. State v. Willis, 706 S.W.2d 265, 267 (Mo. App. 1986).\n\nThe essential flaw in the Alcolac argument is that it would separate environmental cause [liability causation] from biological effect [medical causation] in the diagnosis of disease from toxic exposure. It is a delineation which flaunts and even contradicts its own evidence. Alcolac expert Emmett explained that it is the very function of environmental medicine to establish \"a causal diagnosis for a bodily state.\" The end of such diagnosis is to determine \"not only what somebody had, but why it is caused.\" In that inquiry, therefore, cause and diagnosis are inseparable. It is for that reason, as Dr. Carnow agreed, that the environmental factors [such as source of toxic emissions, identity of the toxins, their toxic profiles, etc.] must be validly established. It is the end of environmental medicine to establish cause, and hence diagnosis, to a high degree of probability. Since there may be \"hundreds of different causes\" for a physical complaint, Dr. Emmett explained, the environmental medicine investigator uses the technique of differential diagnosis to settle on that cause which explains the complaint with satisfactory scientific probability. An alternative source which may also reasonably explain the complaint is also discounted by a like probability to arrive at the true etiology. It was on these principles of environmental medicine that Alcolac expert Emmett determined - subject to alternative source being discounted - that Alcolac was the cause of the acute effects suffered and manifested by the plaintiffs.\n\nIt simply will not do for Alcolac to contend now that an environmental expert may not give opinion of etiology [\"liability causation\"] as an incident of diagnosis. Alcolac experts Emmett and Kerby openly acknowledged that such was a purpose of their testimonial role as chosen experts for the defendants. In fact, the etiology of the manifestations of bodily disease or dysfunction noted by the Alcolac medical experts on the diagnosis chart for each plaintiff was entered according to cause, without distinction to \"medical\" or \"nonmedical\" cause: Alcolac, Another Cause, Pre-existing, Unknown. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e75\u003c/span\u003e\n\nAlcolac argues that, the competency of Dr. Carnow to give opinion on \"liability causation\" assumed, the opinion was guised in the terminology of epidemiology but not faithful to its principles, hence misled the jury and should not have been received. Alcolac alludes once again to the frequency tables and the complaints of the nonplaintiff witnesses.\n\nIt is evident from a glance at the Summary of Symptoms chart that the plaintiffs shared many of the symptoms in common. [The chart merely reflects their trial testimony.] All thirty-one of them manifested some nose, eye, skin or upper respiratory irritation or discomfort. Twenty-four among them displayed tingling, cramps, numbness and other symptoms of peripheral neuropathy. This incidence of symptoms was reflected among the nonplaintiff witnesses as well. The results of the laboratory procedures administered to the plaintiffs [but not, of course, to the nonplaintiffs] established a like commonality of abnormal incidence. These abnormal values were related into evidence by the laboratory reports of testimony of the expert, and their coincidence among the plaintiffs noted, and sometimes capitulated in a summary chart. Thus, the charts and testimony reflected that seven of the seven males who submitted to fertility analysis displayed at least two abnormal results. The peripheral nervous systems of ten of the thirty-one plaintiffs tested abnormally. Twenty among the thirty-one plaintiffs suffered damage to the 8th cranial nerve and hearing loss. Twenty-seven among them demonstrated some porphyrin abnormality - a value the expert described as \"just incredible.\" The immune panels established that twenty-six among the thirty-one plaintiffs suffered from an immune dysfunction. This unusual commonality reflected even at the more discrete test levels: ten among the twenty-four plaintiffs who presented themselves for the Midwest/Wheeler immune panel displayed significantly elevated HNK-1 [human natural killer cell] values. There was allusion to other such frequencies.\n\nIt is not altogether clear what precise objection Alcolac means to lodge against this evidence of commonality or symptoms and abnormal laboratory results. Alcolac argues that the evidence of commonality does not derive from a true epidemiologic study, and hence the coincidences to which it alludes is without validity on the issue of \"liability causation.\" Moreover, the argument continues, even if properly conducted, epidemiology can only determine which factors may be statistically associated with disease occurrence in populations, and not whether \"exposure to a specific chemical causes a specific disease in a specific person.\" \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e76\u003c/span\u003e The salient criticism of the Carnow testimony of the incidence of symptoms and abnormal test results is that \"he had not fulfilled the foremost principle of epidemiology, i.e., use of a control group.\" Rather, the argument continues, the information of symptoms and test results was from a biased group - the plaintiffs themselves. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e77\u003c/span\u003e\n\nThe witness never pretended an epidemiologic study, however, nor proferred any opinion in that guise. His response on cross-examination explains: \"t does not fulfill classic epidemiologic principles, nor was it ever intended to.\" The allusions to common symptoms and laboratory findings, rather, were for the most part responses to hypothetical questions posed to the witness as an environmental medicine expert for opinion on diagnoses - and hence causation. They bore relevantly to determine whether others had been similarly exposed, and hence on the proof of exposure. They also bore relevantly - especially the commonality of abnormal laboratory results - to confirm that the symptoms were not mimics of disease, but of biological conditions usually expected from exposure to the identified toxins. The common symptoms of eye, nose, skin and pulmonary irritation were \"markers\" of the connection between these acute symptoms and the observed source of the emissions - Alcolac:\n\nThose all tell us that not only did these people smell something and see something, but that something got to them, because when it got on their skin, it caused damage, and you could see the damage on their skin. When it got into their throats, it caused sore throats and dry throats. When it got into their eyes, it made their eyes burn and they got red. When it got into their noses, they became chronically irritated and some of them had these terrible nosebleeds, especially the young people, because their membranes are more delicate. All of these are markers. It is almost as if you -- they carried -- there was a stream from the smoke to the skin. These are very important to us in establishing the fact that here were the offending agents and here are the people and that there is a connection between the two. . . . Extraordinarily strong cause and effect.\n\nThe evidence of commonality, in a word, was a means to confirm causation by that \"high degree of probability\" the scientific method imposes on the environmental medicine investigator for valid diagnosis.\n\nThe significance of commonality to cause and effect analysis was confirmed by Alcolac toxicologist Schwartz. He observed that where, for instance [as was usual in the disparity of the medical opinion in the diagnosis of the chronic effects of the exposure on the plaintiffs], \"I had one physician saying I interpret this result as porphyria, and another physician saying not, then I have a problem as to find out whether the person is injured or sick in that regard. So, that is what I am talking about, substantiating the effect.\" In that analysis, although itself the end of the cause and effect inquiry, \"commonality is something you use.\"\n\nIn effect, the diagnoses entered by Dr. Emmett, that the cause of the acute effects manifested by the plaintiffs was exposure to toxic emissions from the Alcolac source, rested on a compound of common symptoms and a logical temporal relationship between the manifestation of symptoms and the episodes of exposure to toxins from an identified point source. The diagnoses of Dr. Emmett and Dr. Carnow differed only to the extent that the latter attributed the chronic effects to Alcolac, and in that process of diagnostic investigation attributed relevancy to the commonality of abnormal test results.\n\nWe conclude that the opinion on \"liability or non-medical causation\" rendered by Dr. Carnow neither invaded the province of the jury, nor rested on unreliable scientific simulations, nor was otherwise tainted by allusions to the nonplaintiff complaints of symptoms and other effects of exposure, nor was the opinion \"contrary to undisputed facts\" - as the point also - almost casually - adds.\n\n4.\n\nUndue Limitation of Cross-examination\n\nThe consolidated cases were tried to the jury over three and one-half months. Of the sixty-nine actual trial days, Dr. Bertram Carnow, a principal witness for the plaintiffs, occupied the stand for eleven days. Cross-examination of the witness, first by one Alcolac counsel and then the other, took almost four days. Alcolac contends nevertheless that cross-examination with the purpose to impeach the witness was unduly restricted by the trial court, and was error.\n\nThe complaint cites five subjects on which the trial court would not allow cross-examination: (1) the diagnoses entered by the witness in prior environmental litigations (2) the fees received for testimony in prior litigations (3) that the methodology used by the witness to derive diagnosis in this case was rejected as untrustworthy in prior litigations (4) misrepresentation by the witness of the number of times he failed to pass the internal medicine boards (5) the areas in which the witness was deficient when he failed to pass the internal medicine boards.\n\nThe first undue restriction on the impeachment of the witness, Alcolac contends, was that the court did not allow cross-examination to show: \"That in several other environmental cases, notably in Illinois and West Virginia, \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e78\u003c/span\u003e Dr. Carnow had without variation given some 250 other plaintiffs the exact same diagnosis given all 31 plaintiffs here: Chronic systemic chemical intoxication.\"\n\nIn fact, cross-examination on that subject was allowed and undertaken, but after some ten pages of transcript colloquy on the subject with the witness, was curtailed because the inquiry was not impeaching, but only repetitious. The purpose of the cross-examination was to elicit from expert witness that chronic systemic chemical intoxication was a diagnosis, and that such diagnosis was entered not only for the thirty-one plaintiffs on this trial, but also as to the 125 plaintiffs in the Boggess case, the 47 plaintiffs in an Illinois case, and 65 plaintiffs in another Illinois case. Cross-examination probed three times to elicit from the witness that the designation was a diagnosis and a diagnosis invariably entered in every one of these claims for bodily disease from chronic exposure to toxic chemicals. The witness responded to these inquiries with the explanation that chronic systemic chemical intoxication was not a diagnosis as such, but merely a generic term used for convenience and pith. He explained that in the Boggess exposure, for instance, the chemicals involved [except for hydrogen sulfide] were different than those to which the plaintiffs here were exposed, and caused different diseases. Those diagnoses were of diseases caused by chronic systemic chemical intoxication by those specific chemicals - dioxin among them. They attack certain organs and cause certain diseases - as do the chemicals to which the plaintiffs here were exposed, and the chemicals to which the plaintiffs in the Illinois cases were exposed. These chemicals share the characteristic of systemic poisons and so, although they cause different diseases, some organs - such as the liver and immune system - are affected by many of them. The proper diagnosis in any such case, his responses reiterated to cross-examination, is chronic systemic chemical intoxication from hydrogen sulfide, dioxin [or other systemic poison or poisons] including [whatever manifestations of bodily disease or dysfunction resulted from the intoxication]. [That was also a subject of testimony already explained in the case in chief.]\n\nThe trial court disallowed further cross-examination on that subject only after it became evident that the line of inquiry was ineffectual as impeachment and unproductive to any relevant end. The trial court observed [a fact already established by the testimony of experts Carnow and Emmett alike] that the essence of the environmental medicine specialty is the diagnosis of disease caused by environmental factors - among them, toxic chemicals which are systemic poisons. Thus, as the court commented a prelude to discontinuance of further cross-examination, it is no more a discredit for the environmental medicine expert to acknowledge that he determined in other plaintiffs chronic systemic chemical intoxication than for an orthopedic expert to acknowledge that he had determined broken bones in other plaintiffs. The court did allow cross-examination to continue to probe whether in the other litigations the witness had found the same manifestations in those plaintiffs as found in these plaintiffs. That examination ensued, and the response was that there were similar findings of liver disease and immune dysfunction among some of them, but he could not give the incidence without consultation of the personal records.\n\nThe interest and bias [and hence credibility] of a witness are always relevant in a litigation, and may be shown, subject only to such limitations on the extent of inquiry as the trial Judge may impose in the exercise of a sound discretion. Houfburg v. Kansas City Stockyards Co. of Maine, 283 706 S.W.2d 539, 548 [18-24] (Mo. 1955). The inquiry defendant insists was a test of credibility, and so a matter for the jury, was only repetitious nonrelevance, and so was properly excluded. Brug v. Manufacturers Bank \u0026 Trust Company, 461 706 S.W.2d 269, 276[5,6] (Mo. banc 1970).\n\nAlcolac contends that the fees received by witness Carnow in prior litigations were a proper subject of cross-examination and that the denial of that line of inquiry was error. The point as fully rescripted complains that the court should have allowed Alcolac to elicit on cross-examination that \"in the Illinois and West Virginia litigation, he had received more than $2 million, in addition to the some $566,000 he was here paid.\" The trial court had repeatedly allowed cross-examination of witness Carnow as to the amount CCA received for its services to these plaintiffs. The trial court also allowed cross-examination as to his involvement in other cases, including the days spent in court for testimony, the number of litigations, by whom employed, and on other kindred subjects. The trial court would not, however, allow questions as to the amount in fees received by CCA and Carnow for services done in other cases - as an irrelevant and collateral inquiry, some prejudicial than probative.\n\nAn inquiry which reasonably bears on the issues in litigation or tends to impeach or discredit the witness is proper cross-examination. The pecuniary interest, or bias or prejudice, of a witness can always be shown. Weatherly v. Miskle, 655 706 S.W.2d 842, 844[3,4] (Mo. App. 1983). So, the court may, in its discretion, allow cross-examination of an expert witness to show pecuniary interest, or bias or prejudice where these factors can affect the value of his testimony. 31 AmJur 2d, Expert and Opinion Evidence § 50 (1967). In the usual course, therefore, a court allows inquiry as to the amount the witness will receive to testify as an expert, but does not allow cross-examination as to compensation in other cases, unless that bears materially on the interest of the witness in the case in litigation. Board of Public Buildings v. GMT Corporation, 580 706 S.W.2d 519, 531[15-17] (Mo. App. 1979). Where the inquiry into interest and prejudice as proposed and tendered, however, itself augurs prejudice more than probative purpose, the court may deny its exercise. Id. The court may deny its exercise as well where the inquiry as tendered so lacks definition as to involve collateral and irrelevant inquiry. Hurlock v. Park Lane Medical Center, Inc., 709 706 S.W.2d 872, 876[1-3] (Mo. App. 1985).\n\nWhen a tender of impeachment cross-examination is refused by the trial court, the party who seeks to pursue the inquiry must define to the trial court the facts proposed to be shown in the inquiry as well as the witness, exhibit or other evidential source for the proof. The mere statements and Conclusions of the interrogator are not enough. Kinzel v. West Park Investment Corporation, 330 706 S.W.2d 792, 795[1-4] (Mo. 1959). If by testimony, then the witness should be placed on the stand and the questions propounded and the answers given. If by other evidential source, then that proof should be presented to the trial court. In that manner, the trial court is readily enabled to an informed decision as to whether the evidence bears to impeach or tends to collateral subjects and prejudice. The procedure also enables an informed appellate review on the correctness of the trial court decision. State v. Sullivan, 553 706 S.W.2d 510, 513[1,2] (Mo. App. 1977). In the absence of an objection or request for further definition, however, the offer of proof need not tender the witness proper, but - if otherwise sufficient - may be accepted by the trial court for purposes of ruling. Stapleton v. Griewe, 602 706 S.W.2d 810, 813 (Mo. App. 1980). Where the purpose of impeachment is to establish the interest - and hence bias - of an expert witness by evidence of the compensation received in other cases for testimony as an expert, the offer of proof must include evidence that in fact the expert received the compensation. That evidence also - to avoid collateral effect - must raise an inference that the payments received by the witness went beyond the fair compensation usual for such services. Annotation, Cross-Examination - \"Professional Witness,\" 39 A.L.R.4th 742, 758 (1985).\n\nAlcolac argues that Dr. Carnow is a \"professional witness,\" and so to show his interest and bias it was legitimate to elicit on cross-examination that he had received $2 million dollars for services as an expert in cases other than this litigation. The offer of proof was the statement of counsel to the court that the witness had received those sums from the plaintiffs in other cases - only informally identified. The plaintiffs objected to the offer of proof as not sufficient in law. And, in fact, the representations of counsel were the entire offer of proof. There was no request to put the witness, there present, on the stand to establish facts for impeachment. Actually, it would have been a futile gesture since the witness had already explained repeatedly that the sum charged a plaintiff reflected not his fee, but total expense for work done or sponsored by CCA to derive data for a scientifically competent determination of cause and environmental medicine diagnosis. The charge indeed included not only his medical as well as court services, but also those of the cadre of scientists, medical specialists, and other such professionals, as well as for laboratory services, environmental field tests, and for all those other procedures necessary to establish causation in cases of system diseases from exposure to toxic chemicals. Nor, despite their available medical and scientific experts and a meticulous course of pretrial discovery, did the Alcolac offer of proof assert as fact that any charge of any kind to any of the 300 [or so] plaintiffs in those other litigations was unreasonably disproportionate to the service rendered or was so unfair as to evince an inference that the interest of the witness was in the money paid for those opinions rather than for the probity of those opinions.\n\nWe cannot but express uneasiness over the implications for fair adjudications that the extraordinary costs of toxic tort litigation imports. It is an inescapable fact, nevertheless, that a toxic tort cause of action, particularly for chronic effects of chronic exposure, requires the evidence of a range of scientific and medical specialists - however expensive their services. Therefore, to tender as evidence of impeachment that a sum of money was paid as recompense for expert services - per se - proves nothing and discredits nothing. The offer of proof was incomplete, unfocused and collateral. It was within the discretion of the trial court to refuse that component of the offer of proof. Lineberry v. Shull, 695 706 S.W.2d 132, 137 (Mo. App. 1985).\n\nAlcolac complains also that the refusal of the trial court to allow cross-examination to show that the methodology used by the witness to derive diagnosis in this case was rejected as untrustworthy in prior litigations improperly curtailed the right of cross-examination. That contention assumes that the methodology used in the prior litigations was the same as used in this case to derive diagnosis, and assumes also that the methodology used in this case was amiss. We have already concluded that the methodology used by Carnow to arrive at diagnosis for each plaintiff here - that of differential diagnosis of risk variables and confounding factors as to each individual plaintiff - was the orthodox methodology of environmental medicine. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e79\u003c/span\u003e That testimony was thoroughly probed on cross-examination, and Alcolac does not and cannot complain of want of opportunity for inquiry.\n\nThe prior litigations to which the point alludes are two cases: The Boggess case \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e80\u003c/span\u003e and the Agent Orange case. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e81\u003c/span\u003e In fact [as already discussed] Alcolac examined the expert witness concerning his diagnosis in Boggess, but never questioned the methodology by which they were derived. It was an inquiry never attempted, and hence never denied. The complaint Alcolac makes here was as to a trial event never undertaken, never refused, and so never a subject of error.\n\nThe other case, Agent Orange, was a national class action by servicemen exposed to chemical defoliants, including Agent Orange, during the Vietnam war. They claimed damages for cancers, birth defects and other injuries to themselves and their families from the exposure to the herbicides. These substances contained dioxin, a chemical highly toxic to humans. In addition to the class action, numerous opt-out plaintiffs filed separate suits. Anna Lilley, wife of deceased veteran John Lilley, was among the opt-out plaintiffs. All of the Agent Orange cases were consolidated and came before federal district court Judge Weinstein. The Judge approved a $280 million settlement for the class action, but denied recovery to the opt-out plaintiffs by summary judgment. The court concluded that their evidence failed as a matter of law to prove any causative connection between exposure to the defoliants and the cancers and other diseases.\n\nIn the Lilley case, the proof of causation for the death of John Lilley from leukemia rested essentially on the affidavit of Dr. Carnow. The affidavit expressed the opinion of Dr. Carnow to a reasonable medical certainty that the numerous diseases and fatal cancer of the decedent were caused by exposure to the dioxin poison during service in Vietnam. That opinion assumed as fact that Lilley was extensively exposed to dioxin in Vietnam and that thereafter he was not exposed to any carcinogens or other toxic chemicals. The information on which the expert relied for medical opinion was supplied by Mrs. Lilley and Comeaux [who served with Lilley in Vietnam], by medical records and scientific studies on exposure to dioxin. The affidavits of Mrs. Lilley and Comeaux to the defendant chemical companies, however, suggested that the service Lilley performed exposed him to other toxic chemicals and that, also contrary to an assumption of the Carnow affidavit, Lilley did smoke. Judge Weinstein rejected the Carnow opinion of causation because, in effect, the information on which the opinion rested was \"sketchy and unreliable.\" That court disagreed also that the scientific studies \"establish any cause and effect relationship.\" 611 F. Supp. at 1272. In exclusion of the affidavit as without probative effect on the issue of summary judgment, Judge Weinstein invoked Rule 703 of the Federal Rules of Evidence, which qualifies the date on which an expert may rely for opinion. The court noted that \"Dr. Carnow has never examined John Lilley instead relies almost exclusively on hearsay information about Mr. Lilley's symptoms, personal habits and medical background he confused recollection of Mrs. Lilley.\" Id. at 1280. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e82\u003c/span\u003e\n\nThe data on which the diagnoses of the plaintiffs here rest, on the other hand, derive from just such procedures of personal interview, description of symptoms and medical history which Judge Weinstein determined an expert in environmental medicine would reasonably rely on for diagnosis, but lacked. Not only were these factors meticulously probated [as our opinion laboriously reports], but also the occupational, genetic and domestic factors which impinged as risk variables in the derivation of cause and disease but the method of differential diagnosis. There were also the laboratory test results of the numerous organs usually affected by chronic exposure to the toxic chemicals Alcolac used.\n\nThe trial court here refused the offer of proof into evidence of the memorandum, order and judgment entered by Judge Weinstein in the Lilley case as impeachment of the validity of the methodology used by Dr. Carnow in the derivation of the diagnoses of these plaintiffs. The court denied the proffer of evidence with the reason:\n\nThere is no relevance to this case at all to what this doctor may have done in another case and other circumstances and one in which, I feel, having read that opinion at length, is so disparate and so contrasting to what we have here today that there is just no basis of comparison, and I just feel it is immaterial, it is irrelevant and should not even be inquired into at any time.\n\nThere was no abuse of discretion for the court to conclude that the tendency of the exhibit and any inquiry under it was, not to impeach or discredit, but to get before the jury evidence merely irrelevant and collateral. There was neither error nor prejudice to the defendant. Brug v. Manufacturers Bank \u0026 Trust Company, 461 706 S.W.2d 269, 276 (Mo. banc 1970).\n\nThe final contentions on this point relate to two other denials of cross-examination of witness Carnow for purposes of impeachment. Carnow acknowledged that although he was board-qualified, he had never passed the internal medicine board, and in fact had failed them some five times. Those episodes were more than twenty years ago, and he explained the exigencies that accounted for these failures. Apparently, from fault of memory or purpose, the witness had responded to cross-examination in several prior litigations that he had failed the internal medicine boards once or twice, rather than the actual five times. Alcolac offered to prove these earlier responses as untruths and hence as impeachment of his credibility. The trial court allowed Alcolac to cross-examine as to how many times the witness had failed the internal medicine boards, the scores on those examinations, and how those past failures impinged on his expert opinions where they related to internal medicine. The court would not allow cross-examination to elicit that in prior litigations he had minimized the number of times he had failed those boards and hence misrepresented that fact.\n\nThe proposed inquiry was clearly as to a collateral matter, and was properly denied. Hurlock v. Park Lane Medical Center, Inc., 709 S.W.2d at 877[3]. The witness was presented, received and gave opinion, not as a physician expert in internal medicine, but as a physician expert in occupational and environmental medicine. As such, he was competent and qualified to render diagnoses and medical opinions as to the several plaintiffs. See In re \"Agent Orange\" Product Liability Litigation [Anna M. Lilley], 611 F. Supp. at 1280[5]. In fact, he was board certified and expert as a preventive medicine physician as well as a pulmonary medicine physician - itself a subspeciality of internal medicine. Whether or not the witness forgot, or even lied, as to the number of times he failed the internal medicine boards, therefore, does not impinge upon the credibility of his medical opinions in the case. Id. On the other hand, it was legitimate to cross-examine the witness as to how internal medicine impinged on his diagnoses and to impeach those opinions by his non-expert status in that field. That inquiry was allowed.\n\nOn the occasion of his failed examination in year 1962, Dr. Carnow made inquiry of the American College of Internal Medicine as to \"what areas should bone up on,\" and the response was infectious diseases and some other areas. Alcolac complains that the denial of the offer of proof to impeach the expert witness by the contents of the letter of response was error. The court excluded the proposed evidence because of remoteness in time - and hence lack of relevance. It is evident that in that twenty-three year interim the witness had developed expertise in at least one phase of internal medicine - pulmonary medicine - and, in any event he was neither presented nor gave opinion as an expert in internal medicine as such. There was no abuse of discretion in the disallowance of cross-examination on that subject.\n\n5.\n\nInstruction No. 9\n\nThe negligence count of the petition was submitted by verdict director Instruction No. 9:\n\nYour verdict must be for plaintiff Betty Elam if you believe:\n\nFirst, either:\n\ndefendant Alcolac, Inc. loaded the bio-oxidation ponds beyond their design capacity, or\n\ndefendant Alcolac, Inc. allowed unfiltered toxic waste to go directly into the bio-oxidation ponds, or\n\ndefendant Alcolac, Inc. failed to operate the liquid incinerator in a manner which would prevent toxic chemicals from being discharged into the atmosphere, or\n\ndefendant Alcolac, Inc. failed to store toxic chemicals so as to prevent toxic chemicals from escaping into the atmosphere, and\n\nSecond, defendant Alcolac, Inc. in any one or more of thr respects submitted in paragraph First, was thereby negligent, and\n\nThird, such negligence directly caused or directly contributed to cause damage to plaintiff Betty Elam. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e83\u003c/span\u003e\n\nAlcolac contends that Instruction No. 9 prejudicially deviated in form and substance from MAI and that the causation element of the submission otherwise lacked support in the evidence.\n\nAlcolac argues that Rule 70.02(a) enjoins that instructions submit only ultimate issues to the jury, and not detailed evidentiary facts, but that Instruction No. 9 violates that prescription. The argument defines the ultimate issue for submission as: \"whether Alcolac permitted chemicals to escape from its premises and come into contact with plaintiffs.\" Paragraph First of the instruction, Alcolac argues, submits four evidentiary details, none of which passes on the ultimate issue. Alcolac disserves itself with that argument. Paragraph First submits only the conduct which constitutes the breach of duty, and not an issue of causation. To accept the definition of the ultimate issue as Alcolac proposes: \"whether Alcolac permitted chemicals to escape from its premises and come into contact with plaintiffs,\" would leave nothing for the jury to decide because Alcolac evidence acknowledges that Alcolac was not only the source of the toxic emissions which impinged on the plaintiffs but also that the emissions produced the acute effects to their bodily systems. That is to say, that as to the acute effects, the Alcolac evidence acknowledges both the ultimate issue [as posed by the defendant] that Alcolac not only permitted chemicals to escape from its premises and come into contact with plaintiffs, but also caused biological damage. Yet, there remained another and more serious issue: whether the emissions were of the kind, quantity and duration to expose the plaintiffs to the risk of the kind of chronic and latent disease their evidence shows they incurred, and that the chronic exposure actually caused the biological disease diagnosed in the plaintiffs. That issue, however, was not a matter of breach of duty, but of risk assessment and biological causation.\n\nInstruction No. 9, a disjunctive negligence submission modified to apply to joint tort-feasors, is a composite of MAI 17.02 and MAI 19.01. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e84\u003c/span\u003e The MAI 17.00 series appertains to motor vehicle negligence. There is no MAI paradigm for the submission of toxic tort negligence. Actionable negligence nevertheless is proven by the existence of a legal duty, failure to perform that duty, and injury caused by the neglect. Hoover's Dairy, Inc. v. Mid-America Dairymen, 700 S.W.2d 426, 431[1,2] (Mo. banc 1985). MAI 17.02 articulates those essential elements of the negligence cause of action and suffices as the construct for the submission of the toxic tort the petitions plead and the evidence proves. A modification of that form was apt for the submissions of each of the negligence causes of action proven by the plaintiffs. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e85\u003c/span\u003e\n\nWhere an MAI must be modified or an applicable MAI instruction lacks, the Rule 72.02(e) requires that the modification or devised instruction be simple, brief, impartial, and free from argument or detailed evidentiary findings. Hall v. County of New Madrid, 645 S.W.2d 149, 151[4,5] (Mo. App. 1982). It is the error in factfinding, in terms of undue emphasis, confusion and other unfairness engendered by unnecessary details, that Rule 72.02(e) means to avoid. Id. Alcolac does not explain how any of these disjunctives of Paragraph First unduly encumbers the fact-finder, or misleads, or clouds the role of the jury to come to a fair determination on a fair definition of the issues. The argument is only that none of these four disjunctive assignments \"require any finding of emissions of toxic chemicals actually escaping into the air so as to somehow leave the premises and reach plaintiffs.\" \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e86\u003c/span\u003e It suffices to respond again that the submission of the issue Alcolac argues Paragraph First of Instruction No. 9 lacks was not in genuine dispute and was not necessary for proper instruction. Johnson v. Pacific Intermountain Exp. Co. 662 S.W.2d 237, 245[12,15] (Mo. banc 1983), cert denied, 466 U.S. 973 (19). There was abundant testimony from lay and expert witnesses that the operation of the liquid incinerator generated a haze in the atmosphere which caused annoyance and symptoms to the residents - numerous of the plaintiffs among them. It was in response to these complaints of exposure to emissions from the Alcolac source which brought a number of Alcolac plant managers, president Anderson and Boies to the residences of a number of the plaintiffs.\n\nThe fourth disjunctive, that Alcolac failed to store toxic chemicals so as to prevent the compounds from escape into the atmosphere, was supported by the testimony of employees and Alcolac official entries. Some of the toxic waste from Alcolac production, employees testified, were stored in drums of steel or paper and were simply lined outside the buildings and roadway so that large trucks ran over and crushed them. The waste so exposed then evaporated into the atmosphere. There was evaporation also when the chemicals ate through the drums and leaked. There was also evaporation into the atmosphere when drums exploded from the heat, as they did. To control these environmental practices, the abatement agreement concluded between Alcolac and DNR called for the immediate storage of all drummed waste into one of the designated buildings which were designed to collect odors through the system of activated carbon.\n\nThe four disjunctives, each, were supported by substantial evidence and hence were submissible.\n\nAlcolac contends also that Instruction No. 9 is erroneous because paragraph Third allows recovery if the Alcolac negligence \"directly caused or directly contributed to cause damage to [the plaintiffs] even though the submission was against only one tort-feasor. Alcolac argues that this modification of MAI 17.02 unduly favors the plaintiffs since it imposed a lesser burden than the \"direct result\" finding of MAI 17.02 proper. The contention Alcolac makes was not presented as an objection to Instruction No. 9, either to the trial court at submission or on the motion for new trial after verdict, and so is not preserved for our review. Romines v. Donald Maggi, Inc., 636 S.W.2d 130, 132[2] (Mo. App. 1982).\n\nThe point is otherwise without merit. MAI sanctions the 19.01 joint-tort-feasor \"directly caused or directly contributed to cause damage to plaintiff\" modification whether or not the other tort-feasor is a party. Notes on Use, MAI 19.01. It was the recurrent insistence of Alcolac - punctuated throughout the trial - that the Missouri Pacific Railroad Yards, Missouri Pressed Metals, and other industrial plants near Alcolac - were sources of the pollution the plaintiffs experienced and accounted for their symptoms and diseases. It was also the recurrent insistence of Alcolac that the elimination of these operations of alternative sources of the pollution to which plaintiffs were exposed was an element of the causation in fact in a toxic tort action, and hence was a burden of proof cast on the plaintiffs. The plaintiffs acceded to that burden and, by means of a detailed hypothetical to expert Carnow [already fully related] which posed the evidence of the numerous witnesses as to the operations of the Missouri Pacific Railroad yard and the other several industrial sites in the environs - as to any toxic materials used, the quantity and kind of waste, the method of its disposal, and other relevant data - derived the reasonably certain medical opinion from the expert that none of these alternative sources was the cause of any of the disease diagnosed in any of the plaintiffs. The issue of possible alternative source and tort-feasance, therefore, remained before the jury as an element of the proof of biological causation and diagnosis, and the MAI 19.01 \"directly caused or directly contributed to cause\" modification was proper. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e87\u003c/span\u003e\n\nIncreased Risk of Cancer\n\nAlcolac argues also that it was error for the trial court to refuse to exclude the testimony and opinion rendered by Dr. Carnow that each of the plaintiffs \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e88\u003c/span\u003e suffered increased risk of cancer. It was an error, moreover, made prejudicial by the manner in which that prognosis was adduced from the witness and exploited before the jury. The contention assumes that the medical opinion amounts to a prognosis of increased risk of cancer. It assumes also that Bennett v. Mallinkrodt, Inc., 698 S.W.2d 854 (Mo. App. 1985), cert denied, 476 U.S. 1176 (1986) settles that our law neither countenances nor compensates increased risk of cancer. We do not understand Bennett to announce the peremptory rule Alcolac asserts for that decision. Our response need not delineate the rationale of Bennett, however, because the prognoses do not forecast increased risk of cancer, and in any event the evidence does not prove the cause of action.\n\nIt was the theme of the Carnow testimony, repeated throughout a lengthy course of examination, that all of the plaintiffs were exposed by Alcolac to multiple toxins and carcinogens so that they suffer irreversible damage to their organs and to their immune systems. Since a single molecule of a carcinogen [such as epichlorohydrin] can alter DNA and so induce a deformed cell line - and malignancy, the more the exposure and the more of the chemical, the more the probability of cancer. Since the immune system - the major defense against cancer - has been irreversibly damaged - the chronic exposure heightens the probability of an eventaual malignancy. In this exposition, the prognosis and medical opinion entered by Dr. Carnow for each one of the plaintiffs hovered between certain cancer and risk of cancer:\n\nA. . . . a single molecule of epichlorohydrin can cause alterations of a single cell, of its DNA, the protein in the cell. If that cell is not killed by the immune system, and if that cell is growable - sometimes the deformity is such that they won't grow, they die - and, then, conceivably, it can grow, but, of course this is - the more of the chemical and the more repeated the exposure, the more the probability that many cells will be altered, and of these many cells that will be altered, one of them may not be killed by the immune system, and that that cell, then, can go on and develop a new cell line, which could, then, become malignant. That's what it is.\n\nBut, there is no question that the more the exposure, and the chemicals that you were exposed to, the more toxic in terms of carcinogenic properties, and the more the intensity of your exposure, the more the probability that you will develop cancer.\n\nQ. And your testimony is that every one of these people, every one of these 32 people, will have cancer before they die?\n\nA. No, I never said that. I said that these people have abnormal immune systems, and that because of that they are at very high risk to cancer.\n\nNow, there is a thing that we call competing risk in epidemiologic parlance, and competing risk means that they may die from something else before they die from the cancer, because the problem we have here is that these people have suffered systemic poisoning, and it may well be that they will die from something else as a result of their exposure, and the breakdown of their body systems, you know, the porophyrins and so on, that they may die from another disease, liver disease, or one of the other diseases before they get the cancer; yes.\n\nQ. Are you prepared to quantify that risk that you are talking about?\n\nA. No, I cannot do that. There is not - there is not enough information in science to do that.\n\nThe ambivalence of opinion, between certain cancer and increased risk of cancer, persisted in the course of prognosis of the individual plaintiffs. In the assessment of plaintiff Ethel Berry, the expert explained the \"very guarded\" prognosis entered:\n\nAnd that is why we put this in. And, again, there are many reasons for this. So many systems involved, a lot of liver diseases, heart disease and the very severe immune system dysfunction, which makes this - and I should again note that part of what goes into my making my prognosis is the fact that all of these people are at extraordinary risk to developing cancer for two reasons. One, they have been exposed to a host of cancer producing chemicals, some of them direct carcinogens, like epichlorohydrin. That means that they don't need to work with anything else. They can directly destroy and start cancer. And the second reason is because the immune system, which is the major defense against cancer, had been severely damaged in most of these people. [emphasis added]\n\nIn the assessment of plaintiff Dorothy Bradley, on the other hand, the expert explained the \"very guarded\" prognosis entered:\n\nAnd, again, one of the components of the very guarded diagnosis is it's my opinion that if these people live long enough, they will develop cancer because of their exposure to multiple carcinogens and because of the damage done to their immune system.\n\nThe arguments of the litigants are indifferent to the variableness of this medical opinion and its implications as valid prognosis. Alcolac argues only that the testimony was inadmissible because our law does not recognize a cause of action for increased risk of cancer. The plaintiffs respond that the opinion - that all of the plaintiffs, if they live long enough, will die from malignancy - because rendered as a reasonable medical certainty, validates that forecast as medical evidence.\n\nA prediction that cancer is certain from exposure to carcinogens, however, is a forecast of science does not deliver and an opinion, however clinical, medicine cannot derive. It is a commonplace that science has not yet \"penetrated the molecular puzzle of cancer.\" That is to say, the mechanisms of carcinogenesis are still unknown. Thus, \"when a scientist states that a chemical causes cancer, the term cause is consciously hedged, and necessarily burdened by some degree of uncertainty.\" Brennan \u0026 Carter, Legal and Scientific Probability of Causation of Cancer and Other Environmental Disease in Individuals, 10 Journal of Health Politics, Policy and Law 33, 46 (Spring, 1985). And, \"although we accept that the chronic exposure of a number of mammalian tissues to a variety of chemical agents often results in the evolution of the exposed cells to malignancy, there is no phase or facet of this process, from its primary cellular interactions to its terminus in the death of the host, that is fully understood. We cannot state with certainty that the process results solely from the interaction of the suspected chemical agent with target cells.\" Carcinogens: Identification and Mechanisms of Action, 5 (Griffin \u0026 Shaw ed., 1979). And, in fact, the testimony of expert Carnow abounds with recognitions that the cancer mechanism cannot be predicted because \"each person, based on their genetic constitution, is at different risks . . . based upon the strength of their immune systems a whole bunch of individual factors.\"\n\nThat the prognosis of certain cancer was articulated in terms of reasonable medical certainty only confounds the sense of that opinion. A medical opinion that a future damage or result will follow is an estimate of probability, and not a declaration of certainty. It informs that the consequence is more likely than not. Crawford v. Chicago-Kansas City Freight Line, Inc., 443 S.W.2d 1;61, 165-7 (Mo. 1969); Dallas v. Burlington Northern, Inc., 689 P.2d 273, 277[6,7] (Mont. 1984); Lane v. State Farm Mut. Auto Ins. Co., 308 N.W.2d 503, 512[5] (Neb. 1981). A probability that cancer will manifest from tortious conduct is an opinion that the conduct has increased the risk of cancer.\n\nWe assume, as does Alcolac, that the forecast by Dr. Carnow of future cancer for plaintiffs is a prognosis of increased risk of cancer from the chronic exposure. A recovery for increased risk of cancer, however - whatever the theory adopted - involves proof of a quantified risk. One theory treats the cause of action for increased risk of cancer as a present injury with future consequences. It allows recovery if the toxic exposure had induced some biological manifestation from which the anticipated cancer is reasonably certain to occur - as quantified by expert testimony as a probability of occurrence of greater than fifty percent. If the cause of action is proven, there is a full recovery of damages as for a realized cancer. Jackson v. Johns-Manville Sales Corp., 781 F.2d 394, 411[10] (5th Cir. banc 1986) cert. denied, 478 U.S. 1022 (1986); Sterling v. Velsicol Chem. Corp., F.2d, (6th Cir. No. 86-6087, adopted August 29, 1988) (Westlaw Allfeds Lib.); Brafford v. Susquehanna Corp., Recovery for Cancerphobia and Increased Risk of Cancer, 15 Cumb. L. Rev. 723, 736 (1985). The other theory treats increased risk of cancer as a present invasion of a legally protected interest, and hence actionable event absent any manifestation of injury. The increased risk, as quantified by expert testimony as a percentage of probability, measures the recovery. If the cause of action is proven, the damages are awarded for cancer caused by the identified toxic chemicals but proportionately reduced by the quantified probability that the plaintiff will not manifest cancer. See Gale \u0026 Goyer, 15 Cumb. L. Rev. at 742; Note, An analysis of the Enhanced Risk Cause of Action (Or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love Toxic Waste), 33 Vill. L. Rev. 437, 456 (1988); Note, Increased Risk of Cancer as an Actionable Injury, 18 Ga. L. Rev. 563, 589 (1984); Restatement (Second) of Torts § 7 (1985); Pelcha v. United Amusement Co., 44 Or. App. 675, 606 P.2d 1168 (1980); Jordan v. Bero, 210 S.E.2d 618, 640 (1974) (Neely, J., Concurring).\n\nThe proof of the cause of action under either theory, therefore, requires opinion of quantified probability of disease. We agree with Alcolac that the acknowledged inability of Dr. Carnow to quantify the risk rendered the medical opinion that all of the plaintiffs were at extraordinary risk of cancer nonprobative \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e89\u003c/span\u003e - as that evidence impinged upon the recovery of damages for increased risk of cancer. The evidence of significant, albeit unquantified, risk of cancer \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e90\u003c/span\u003e [as well as other disease] from the exposure to the toxic Alcolac shown, however, was competent to prove, as a separate element of damage, the need for medical surveillance of the immune system and other organs, and hence was admissible for that purpose. Hagerty v. L \u0026 L Marine Servs., Inc., 788 F.2d 315, 319 (5th Cir. 1986); Ayers v. Jackson Township, 106 N.J. 557, 525 A.2d 287, 315[11] (1987); Askey v. Occidental Chem. Corp., 102 A.D.2d 130, 447 N.Y.S. 2d 242, 247[6] (1984). Indeed the prudence and urgency of such a course for early detection of serious disease from the chronic exposure was the agreed advice of both immunologists, Zahalsky and Stech-schulte. Also, those among the plaintiffs diagnosed with porphyria and other chronic diseases were advised by CCA to monitor the conditions by appropriate medical oversight. Compensation for necessary medical expenses reasonably certain to be incurred in the future rests on well-accepted legal principle. Wilcox v. Swenson, 324 S.W.2d 664, 673 (Mo. 1959); MAI 4.01. See, Note, Medical Surveillance Damages: A Solution to the Inadequate Compensation of Toxic Tort Victims, 63 Ind. L.J. 849 (1988) authored by Allan T. Slagel)\n\nAlcolac does not complain, however, that the evidence to prove the need for medical surveillance of disease not yet fully realized was improperly received. It argues in effect, rather, that other evidence, directed to prove that all the plaintiffs were destined to manifest cancer from the chemical exposures, was not only nonprobative but altogether collateral to the need for medical surveillance, and hence should have been excluded. There is no doubt from the colloquy of counsel with the court that the evidence to come from Dr. Carnow was the medical prognosis that all of the plaintiffs were at extraordinary [or certain] risk of of cancer, and that such evidence was to prove damages for unquantified increase risk of cancer. Nor is there doubt [as counsel for plaintiffs explained to the court] that those claims were a prominent component of the damages asserted for recovery from Alcolac. In those circumstances it was an abuse of discretion to have received the testimony and opinions. Of course, the trial court is allowed a wise range of discretion to admit or exclude doubtful evidence. Lawson v. Schumaker \u0026 Blum Chevrolet, Inc., 687 S.W.2d 947, 951[1,2] (Mo. App. 1985). It is the role of the trial court nevertheless to exclude evidence when the danger of prejudice outweighs its probative benefit. Jones v. Terminal R.R. Ass'n of St. Louis, 242 S.W.2d 473, 477[6-10] (Mo. 1951). The evidence of increased risk of cancer [by then long since formed without quantification] introduced a collateral issue of recovery which suggested to the jury an improper basis for decision and confused the subject of damages. It was error not to have heeded the Alcolac objection to its admission. Conley v. Kaney, 250 S.W.2d 350, 353[3,4] (Mo. 1952).\n\nAlcolac argues that the evidence of increased risk of cancer was not only erroneous, but inflammatory and prejudicial as well. The extravagant color used by counsel to elicit the medical opinion from the expert suggests just such an effect.\n\nQ. Yes. And under the subject of time bombs, can I write the word cancer?\n\nA. Yes, indeed.\n\nQ. All right. And the fact that these time bombs will go off in each and every one of my clients' bodies, is that a fact that you are telling this Judge and this jury based on reasonable medical certainty.\n\nA. It is my opinion that if these people live long enough, they will each have cancer, yes. [emphasis added]\n\nThat vivid figure of speech was not only reinsinuated to the jury in the course of an attenuated risk of cancer medical proof, but also on closing statement to argue compensatory and punitive damages:\n\nHe talked about the fact that what is in the bodies of my clients has created time-bombs. And it is a good analogy, because you don't know exactly when they are going to explode. One of our clients has already had her cancer, and she's beginning to show.\n\nhey will all in fact surely contract cancer if they live to a normal life expectancy. [emphasis added]\n\nThe medical opinion of the risk or certainty of cancer, albeit not always in the same tone, was argued to the jury repeatedly to exhort damages - actual and punitive.\n\nWe agree that it was error for the trial court to allow the evidence and argument. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e91\u003c/span\u003e We defer consideration of how this error may have prejudiced the damages and verdicts, however, until treatment of the cross-appeals of the plaintiffs. The verdicts returned actual and punitive damages for each of the plaintiffs on the negligence count, but they were set aside and new trial entered on those issues. The appeals of the plaintiffs seek reinstatement of the verdicts. Thus, the Disposition of those appeals impinge on the Alcolac contention that awards of damages were unfairly influenced by the evidence and argument of increased risk of cancer.\n\nMiscellaneous Errors\n\nAlcolac raises a cluster of other contentions of error. There is complaint that the court did not manage the trial well, that improper closing argument was allowed, and of still other evidentiary errors. To the extent that these complaints, however guised, reargue evidence and points already considered and determined, they are redundant and will not be addressed.\n\na.\n\nConduct of Trial\n\nThere is complaint that the court lacked firm control over the proceedings, procrastinated rulings, and erred as to others. There is complaint also as to the order of cross-examination imposed on the defendant, and as to comments used by the court in the course of ruling. A number of these complaints are as to insubstantial events. Others are already answered. As to the rule of cross-examination, the court denied the request of Alcolac to interrupt the direct examination of witness Carnow at the Conclusion of his testimony on each of the thirty-one plaintiffs, and ordered, rather, that cross-examination follow at the Conclusion of direct as to all of the plaintiffs. Alcolac argues that \"he manifest confusion this engendered with the jury is obvious in the verdicts they rendered.\" It is ironic that Alcolac claims as the source of verdict error the very procedure its insistence imposed on the plaintiffs: the concurrent submission and argument of all thirty-one claims to the jury for verdict. This point is denied - as are the others which complain about the decisions on trial procedure. The rulings the complaints cite are well within the discretion of the court to make in the course of the management of a trial, and were not otherwise improvident. Holt v. Queen City Loan \u0026 Inv., Inc., 377 S.W.2d 393, 400[14] (Mo. 1964).\n\nAlcolac complains also that a comment used by the trial court in the course of ruling was tendentious and unduly unfavorable to the defendant. It argues that the denial of a mistrial was error. Counsel for the plaintiffs used a large tablet on which significant testimony was noted. There was no objection to that procedure. The witness then under examination was Bregman of WAPORA. It had been elicited that the design of the Alcolac bioponds was based on information furnished WAPORA by Bouroff of Alcolac \"as to what would be going into the ponds.\" Counsel for plaintiffs then continued the interrogation and probed for the word he would inscribe on the tablet, as was his practice:\n\nCounsel: Based on what turned out to be false projection?\n\nBregman: Highly erroneous projections. I would rather think they were erroneous than false.\n\nCounsel: That is a longer word.\n\nBregman Mistaken. Mistaken. Wrong.\n\nThe Court: Put bad.\n\nBregman: Bad.\n\nCounsel: That helped me a lot.\n\nThe Court: That cuts it right down to where it really hurts. [emphasis added]\n\nThe defendant moved for mistrial, and mistrial was denied. The court immediately addressed the jury:\n\nLadies and gentlemen of the jury, the last comment that I made concerning the word \"bad\" is not a personal observation of mine about the merits of the case. I wanted to get the shortest word possible to put on this chart over here, and since erroneous was too long, false gave the wrong picture, it might have indicated deceit, I just took the word bad, and that is what I meant by cutting it down. It is not to hurt anybody in the case. It is the Court's shorthand way of getting something on the board quickly, and you should not interpret that to mean that anybody has done a bad job or that the defendant is right, the plaintiff is wrong or any other way.\n\nIt was my choice of words and the comments added gratuitously after that, which I am instructing you to disregard.\n\nIt is improper for a Judge by act, conduct or remark to color the neutral status that role entails. State ex rel. State Highway Comm'n v. Thurman, 427 S.W.2d 777, 781[2,3] (Mo. App. 1968). The comment of the trial court, however hedged by proper purpose, was indecorous and was better left unsaid. In the usual course, counsel should be left to elicit their own testimony from the witnesses. In the circumstances presented, however, the jury could not have but understood from the explanation and instruction given them by the court immediately afterwards that the comment was not meant as an expression of belief or favor of either litigant. State ex rel. Mo. Highways \u0026 Transp. Comm'n. v. Legere, 706 S.W.2d 560, 569[13] (Mo. App. 1986). The explanation and instruction cured whatever prejudice may have resulted from the error, and the mistrial was properly denied. St. Louis County v. Seibert, 634 S.W.2d 590, 592 (Mo. App. 1982).\n\nWe note as a tribute to the adroitness of the trial Judge and the ardent advocacy of counsel that such untoward incidents were remarkably infrequent for a trial so intricate, novel and perdurable.\n\nb.\n\nImproper Closing Argument\n\nAlcolac contends that the argument to the jury concerning the evidence of leaks, chemical spills, bad odors, explosions and other such incidents were beyond the four alternative disjunctives submitted by the negligence verdict director, and hence was improper. MAI enjoins that a verdict director submit only ultimate issues, and leaves the evidentiary detail to argument. Rule 70.02(1); MAI at XXXVI (1981). The verdict director Instruction No. 9, we determined, was a construct conformable to MAI. It is proper for a plaintiff, within an ambit generously drawn, to argue the effect of the evidence on the ultimate issues submitted to the jury. Lewis v. Bucyrus-Erie, Inc., 622 S.W.2d 920, 926 (Mo. banc 1981). The intertwined proof of breach of duty, causation, biological consequence and damage a toxic tort case requires, moreover, justifies a commensurately wide scope of argument, explanation and comment by counsel. It was not an abuse of discretion for the trial court to have allowed the argument Alcolac found objectionable. S. G. Payne \u0026 Co. v. Nowack, 465 S.W.2d 17, 20[5,6] (Mo. App. 1971).\n\nAlcolac contends also that counsel for plaintiffs in closing argument attributed testimony to Dr. Allcorn, the Sedalia practitioner who treated a number of the plaintiffs at an early stage, that were not in the record. The contention is without merit. The transcript confirms that the closing remarks were based on evidence already before the jury and so were proper. Davis v. City of Independence, 404 S.W.2d 718, 720[2-4] (Mo. banc 1966).\n\nAlcolac contends also that certain words and phrases elicited from the witnesses and used by the plaintiffs in interrogation and argument were inflammatory and should have been excluded upon objection. Alcolac cites such terms as \"Alcolac victims,\" \"toxic chemicals,\" \"Love Canal,\" \"Bhopal,\" and others. Some of the terms to which Alcolac ascribed emotional color were altogether innocuous. Some others, such as \"toxic chemicals,\" were part of the legitimate proof and inescapable. Others still were attended by explanations from the court as to how they related to the issues on trial. In the full context of use, none of them were calculated to inflame or prejudice the verdicts of the jury.\n\nWe agree nevertheless that one term recurrently used throughout the trial - chemically induced AIDS - was not only gratuitous, but inflammatory and prejudicial. It was agreed by the experts that exposure to the toxic chemicals identified as used and emitted by Alcolac could work to suppress the immune system. The immunologists for both litigants agreed that the condition went by the medical term chemically induced immune disregulation . It was the testimony of plaintiffs immunologist Zahalsky that when the chemically induced immune disregulation was characterized by an imbalance between the helper and suppressor populations of the T-cells, the condition is more particularly described as chemically induced AIDS. That is because in AIDS the virus works to induce an imbalance between the helper and suppressor populations of the T-cells with the result that the helper cells are functionally wiped out. The difference between the two conditions is that toxic chemicals induce one, and a virus induces the other. Zahalsky found that four among the plaintiffs - Virgil Bradley, Dorothy Bradley, Malva Gehlken and Dainie Landon - displayed the chemically induced AIDS condition. Eight others will develop that condition \"somewhere down the line.\"\n\nThere was no evidence that any plaintiff suffered from viral AIDS, nor was that a claim for damages. The trial Judge nevertheless denied the Alcolac motion in limine for an order to prohibit counsel or witnesses from reference to AIDS as not only irrelevant, but also \"notorious and inflammatory.\" The motion was denied, but the objection saved.\n\nThe plaintiffs respond that the experts, including Alcolac witnesses, approved the term chemically induced AIDS to describe the immune suppression conditions of the plaintiffs. Indeed, the question posed by counsel - \"s this phenomenon [chemically induced AIDS ] supported in the medical and immunological literature?\" - evoked from immunologist Zahalsky the response: \"It certainly is.\" The explanation that followed, however, was ellipitical and vague. It did not say that chemically induced AIDS was a medical disease or even a syndrome. It explained only that the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, prompted by the need to study the action by toxic chemicals on the immune system, has recently issued the publication \"Immune Toxicity\" on the subject. Contrary to assertion of the plaintiffs, none of the Alcolac experts acceded that medicine or science acknowledged chemically induced AIDS as a disease, syndrome, or other cognizable phenomenon. They did agree that both viral AIDS and CIID are acquired immune deficiency syndromes marked by gross imbalance between the helper and suppressor populations of the T-cells, but not that the onset or effect of disease are the same.\n\nThe response of the plaintiffs reduces, in effect, to the argument that since AIDS and CIID are both acquired immune deficiency syndromes and both are marked by the T-cell imbalance, both are benign synonyms for for the other, so that no prejudice can result form the interchange of use. It was explicit in the testimony of the experts, however, that both terms are not interchangeable as a matter of medical definition. Although both expose the victim to opportunistic disease [as does any disregulation of the immune system], AIDS victims display distinctive manifestations, while the effects of CIID are not readily identifiable. Also, AIDS is transmissible, CIID is not. The risk of AIDS is from sexual and drug use practices, the risk of CIID is from exposure to toxic chemicals. AIDS is invariably fatal, CIID is not. See Surgeon General's Report on Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome, (U.S. Department of Health and Human Service, 1988).\n\nThe sexual and drug use practices usually identified with AIDS remain subjects of public disapproval, even opprobrium. The physical appearance of the victim of the advanced disease can be pathetic. The inevitability of death cannot but engender fear in the victim. A jury cannot but be moved to sympathy for those who, without social blame, have become victim to such a disease, and cannot but be inflamed to punish a defendant whose misconduct induced the havoc of AIDS.\n\nThe pervasive use of chemically induced AIDS for chemically induced immune disregulation was unnecessary and gratuitous because the scientific and medical evidence taken most favorably to the verdicts already proved that it was exposure to the Alcolac chemicals that induced the CIID condition in all but two of the plaintiffs. And, as to them, there was competent opinion that the immune system disregulation would manifest later. There was proof, moreover, that Lisa Turley, Lyle Turley and other plaintiffs already manifested those recurrent infections and opportunistic diseases to which victims of suppressed immune systems are vulnerable.\n\nWe are left to conclude that the purpose of the AIDS epithet was to inflame the jury to a heavier award of punitive damages than a fair assessment of any found miscounduct would otherwise justify. That purpose shows from the remarks of counsel on closing argument. That effect shows from the request by the jury during deliberations, and granted by the court, for the IMMUNE CHART BLOW UP WITH PEOPLES NAME IN RED WHO MAY HAVE CHEMICALLY INDUCED AIDS - a reference to exhibit 118. The trial court refusal to exclude the term from the proceedings was prejudicial as it impinged on the issue of punitive damages. The awards of punitive damages, as well as of actual damages, were set aside by the trial court, and the appeals of the plaintiffs seek to reinstate them. Accordingly, we defer assessment of the prejudice we find until the determination of those appeals.\n\nc.\n\nEvidentiary Errors\n\nIn addition to the claims of evidentiary errors already considered as assertions for new trial, Alcolac argues that the hypotheticals to Dr. Carnow and other experts were faulty and otherwise improperly received. As to Dr. Carnow, Alcolac argues that the hypotheticals were improper in form and content, posed no actual question, and received no answers. In short, they were merely lengthy recapitulations of the favorable evidence without purpose of functions. The record discounts that contention.\n\nAs to Dr. Bregman and Dr. Reid, Alcolac argues that hypotheticals to them for opinion should not have been allowed because they were not disclosed under Rule 56.01(b)(4)(a) as experts expected as witnesses at the trial. Bregman and Reid were principals with WAPORA, the environmental management subsidiary of Alcolac. Bregman was president of WAPORA and was involved with the design of the Alcolac plant, and so had personal knowledge of the facility from design to actual operation. Reid was an engineer with WAPORA, expert in the treatment of toxic waste. Alcolac called upon WAPORA to investigate the complaints of odors from the Alcolac operation and to evaluate the malfunctions of the waste disposal plant. They were in fact experts but their testimony was about what they observed, learned and knew about the operation of the plant and the shortcomings of the environmental control system. Alcolac does not say why the Bregman testimony as to the attitude of Alcolac president Anderson was improper. That testimony simply related an attitude unwilling to spend the money necessary to restore the Alcolac environmental control system to proper function - the very purpose Alcolac sought the advice of WAPORA. Alcolac points to no hypothetical question posed to Bregman, nor to any opinion improperly received. The point is without merit.\n\nAlcolac complains also that the trial court erred in the refusal of a mistrial after the testimony of Kenneth Teeters was improperly received. Teeters was a former Division of Health employee and served that agency on 1979. In the course of that duty he investigated a number of complaints about the Alcolac toxic chemicals. He recorded his observations and the narratives of complaints from interviews with area residents, and compiled them as an official report. Those narratives were statements which described the odors, and the annoyance and effects from exposure to them. The persons interviewed included a number of the plaintiffs as well as nonlitigant residents of the environs. The reports compiled by Teeter were qualified under the Business Records Act and received as evidence by the court. Teeter then read to the jury selected portions of the exhibit. Teeter was still a witness when the trial adjourned for the noon recess, and before the proceedings resumed, the court came to the Conclusion that numerous excerpts - such as descriptions of the effects of exposure to the chemicals on their persons and on the fauna and flora - were the kind of hearsay the Business Records Act does not sanction as competent evidence. When the trial resumed, the court by formal instruction withdrew from jury consideration the Teeter testimony of the statements attributed to other people in the report from which he read.\n\nAlcolac argues that the jury had listened to the incompetent testimony for some time, and so the withdrawal instruction did not cure the error. There was, however, virtually nothing the Teeter testimony related that the jury had not heard before or would not hear thereafter. The witnesses the report identifies as the source of the hearsay statements were all presented at the trial and were subject to cross-examination. At least one of them was presented by Alcolac. Many of them related what they had told Teeters. The hearsay evidence at worst was cumulative, and only harmless error. In the circumstances, the withdrawal instruction sufficed as redress and the mistrial was properly denied.\n\nAlcolac also ascribes as error the denial of a motion for mistrial based upon alleged misconduct of the investigator for the plaintiffs. The motion rested on affidavits of Lizzie Barnett, a nonlitigant resident in the environs of Alcolac, and that her daughter, Lana Davis, who was present at the time of the described incident. It was the tenor of these affidavits that one Ed Bruns, investigator for the plaintiffs, visited Barnett on three occasions to importune her as a witness for the plaintiffs, and on a fourth occasion by another investigator. Bruns handed her a check for $25, a pink piece of paper, and a subpoena. She then asked Bruns, the affidavit recites, \"what was in this for ,\" and Bruns then promised $100 additional for her testimony.\" The affidavit of the daughter confirmed the recital of the mother, and added that the investigator described Mrs. Barnett as \"the main witness.\"\n\nThe trial took up the motion before proceeding further with the litigation, but Aloclac rested on the affidavits. The plaintiffs presented one Ramirez, the investigator who had visited Barnett on the fourth occasion. It became evident through his testimony and explanatory comments that counsel for the plaintiffs had come to Sedalia in preparation for the trial, then at hand, to meet with the numerous persons who were expected to testify as to the Alcolac operations. Lizzie Barnett was among those expected, but she had not appeared. That was the purpose for the visit to the Barnett home of investigator Ramirez. He explained that the $25 tendered to Lizzie Barnett with the subpoena was the witness fee the law requires attend that process. The \"pink piece of paper\" the Barnett affidavit describes was the standard \"instruction to witnesses\" form devised by counsel for plaintiffs. It advised that only wages actually lost by the occasion to give court testimony would be reimbursed, that the obligation of the witness was to tell the truth, and then acknowledge forthrightly to any question that the witness had been interviewed about the substance of the expected testimony. Ms. Barnett returned the subpoena, the pink paper and the $25 check to the investigator because she was unable to read them.\n\nIt was the Alcolac ground for the mistrial motion that the encounter of the investigators with Ms. Barnett proves intimidation and suggests \"that there are other witnesses who may fall in the same category\" - so that the integrity of the judicial process was compromised. The intimidation, Alcolac argues, is evident from the comment the Barnett affidavit attributes to investigator Bruns: that Bruns told her \"he was going to tell her neighbors that she was not cooperating with plaintiffs\" and that \"the Judge was mad at him because she did not want to testify.\"\n\nThe trial court found no intimidation of any witness or other conduct by the investigators which compromised the judicial process, and overruled the motion for mistrial. The court determined, rather, that any apprehension Ms. Barnett felt from these encounters was not the result of intimidation, but from a mistaken notion of the nature of the litigation process. The court observed that all of the neighbor witnesses called and to be called were subject to cross-examination, so that Alcolac was free to probe if Alcolac had any intimation that any of them \"has been compromised or intimidated into showing up to testify, or had been paid outrageous sums of money to testify in a certain way.\" Indeed, cross-examination before the hearing on the motion and afterwards explored those subjects, but without effect.\n\nThe motion for mistrial was for the trial court to decide as a matter of discretion. The denial of the motion rests on substantial evidence and was not otherwise an abuse of discretion. Hoene v. Associated Dry Goods Corp., 487 S.W.2d 479, 485[11] (Mo. 1972).\n\n8.\n\nDisposition of the Motion for New Trial\n\nThe trial court properly denied the Alcolac motion for new trial on all issues of the negligence causes of action.\n\nII\n\nThe Nuisance Causes of Action\n\nTwenty-two of the plaintiffs presented evidence to prove that the unreasonable use of its property by Alcolac caused injury to their property. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e92\u003c/span\u003e The causes of action were submitted on the theory of private nuisance by MAI 22.06. The jury returned verdicts for the eleven couples in sums which ranged from $3400 [John and Charlotte Phillips] to $15,400 [John and Gwen Lawrence], and aggregated $110,595.\n\nAlcolac argues that the nuisance claims were not submissible and were otherwise tainted by trial error. Alcolac argues more specifically that there was no substantial evidence to prove the unreasonable use paragraph Third of the private nuisance verdict directors ascribes to Alcolac. Instruction No. 24, the prototype verdict director, submitted:\n\nFirst, Clarence A. and Betty Elam used their\n\nproperty at 1400 East Boonville as a\n\nresidence, and\n\nSecond, defendant Alcolac, Inc. operated a chemical\n\nplant in close proximity to such property,\n\nand\n\nThird, toxic chemicals escaped from Alcolac, Inc.'s\n\npremises onto such property and this substan-\n\ntially impaired plaintiffs' use of their\n\nproperty and damaged plaintiffs' property,\n\nand\n\nFourth, such use by defendant Alcolac, Inc. of its\n\nproperty was unreasonable.\n\n[emphasis added]\n\nAlcolac argues that there was no competent proof that toxic chemicals escaped from its premises onto the land of any plaintiff, or injured the use of that property. The argument asserts that, although there was recurrent testimony that noxious odors invaded the property of the plaintiffs, there was no substantial proof that the odors were toxic. We have determined that the evidence abundantly proves those elements of the negligence causes of action and so, coincidentally, of the private nuisance causes of action as well. The private nuisance submissions were for property damage only. Thus, the additional testimony of dwellings made less comfortable, enjoyable and convenient by the invasion of the Alcolac toxicant emissions proved prima facie submissions of private nuisance. Bower v. Hog Builders, Inc., 461 S.W.2d 784, 794 (Mo. 1970).\n\nAlcolac argues nevertheless that the causes of action were not proven because there was no competent evidence that any damages accrued from toxic chemicals during the period used by the appraiser witness to arrive at the opinion of lost value. The causes of action for damage to property were proven and submitted as permanent nuisances. The measure of damages for permanent nuisance is the difference between the fair market value before and after the injury. Spain v. City of Cape Girardeau, 484 S.W.2d 498, 504[4] (Mo. App. 1972). That element of the causes of action was submitted by instructions on the MAI 4.02 prototype. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e93\u003c/span\u003e\n\nThe opinions of diminished fair market value to the real property of the several plaintiffs from the existence of the permanent Alcolac nuisance were rendered by Teddy Jack Blaylock, real estate broker/appraiser and member of the American Institute of Real Estate Appraisers. His membership connoted competence in the appraisals of all types of real estate. The witness owns and operates Cannon and Blaylock Realty in Columbia, Missouri, a real estate sales and appraisal firm. The firm conducts real estate appraisals throughout the state of Missouri and maintains, as well, an appraisal service - under the supervision of the witness - in Sedalia. His appraisals in the Sedalia area have been sufficiently numerous to enable him to compile records \"as to what property had done in the Sedalia area\" in past years.\n\nThe expert appraiser used the comparable sales or market data method to arrive at the opinions of value as to the several properties. That method measures value by a determination of what comparable properties sell for in the marketplace: the appraiser infers the fair market value of the affected property from sales of comparable property. Mo. Condemnation Practice § 5.9 (Mo. Bar 1973, 1979). The difference in the fair market value of comparable property before the event which constitutes the taking and of comparable property after the event determines the loss or increment in the value of the affected property.\n\nAlcolac commenced operations in April of 1978 and the effects on the enjoyment of their property from the toxic emissions were already known to the plaintiffs by July of 1978. As the basis for the opinions of value under the method used, therefore, appraiser Blaylock adopted April of 1978 as the before date and July of 1978 as the after date. Blaylock explained the reasons for the choice of the July date.\n\nIt was chosen merely as the date immediately following commencement of the operation of the Alcolac plant, which would enable me, as the appraiser, to isolate any changes that might be taking place within the neighborhood, except for the introduction of the Alcolac plant.\n\nIn other words, there could be no changes in streets, no changes in the character of the properties that were being appraised, no changes in interest rates, or in general economic conditions, or in the economic conditions within Sedalia, and, so, that date immediately following was chosen as the after date.\n\nThe witness confined the investigation into comparable sales to an area within four square miles of Alcolac. He resorted to the usual sources for potential comparable sales: information from real estate brokers and appraisers active in the vicinity, his own experience of sales and appraisals of property in the vicinity, the tax assessment rolls of the county, real estate title and tax records, and also the information imparted by the plaintiffs-property owners. That research disclosed that during the year following the installation of Alcolac, real estate sales were \"extremely sluggish\" in those four sections [square miles] of land. Blaylock explained:\n\nithin that neighborhood, immediately following the introduction of the Alcolac plant, in 1979, the year following, there were only two sales of residential real estate within those four sections of land that could be considered as arm's length transactions, sales between a buyer and a seller, not interfamily, but instead, were residential sales.\n\nThere were a total of five transfers \"of all types of real estate within those four section of land\" in 1979, four in 1980, six in 1981, and two in 1982. They were not all comparable sales.\n\nIt was evident to the appraiser that there were not enough comparable sales immediately after July of 1978 to come to a valid opinion of fair market value of the properties affected by the Alcolac presence. In order to arrive at sound after value opinions of the affected properties at all, the witness concluded, it was necessary to consider comparable sales even after several years of July of 1978 in sufficient number to ensure more validity to the opinion of value. That was accomplished by the paired sales technique - the date derived from comparable properties sold twice within the period of research [here, from 1976 through 1985]. The other data for the opinion of values derived from the other, single, comparable sales. In this manner, the value trends of comparable real property were established and a basis for opinions of value of the affected properties in July of 1978.\n\nOne value trend was that comparable property sold for more in 1985 than in July of 1978. Another value trend was that the prices of real estate throughout central Missouri in calendar years 1978, 1979, 1980 - and into 1981, increased from 10 to 15 percent per year from inflation. The prices fell some in 1982, but left a net 25% gain. Another value trend was the rates of interest at an historic high which inhibited sales and at the same time increased the cost to a buyer able to buy. The witness calculated the appreciation in the cost of comparable real estate over the period of research at 65%, but nevertheless attributed the \"very conservative\" appreciation of only 47% to the properties studied and sales compared to arrive at his opinions of the values of the affected properties in July of 1978. In that manner, all possibility of \"false appreciation\" was eliminated as a factor of value even as to \"the most conservative of buyers.\" It was by this method of market value trend between July of 1978 and 1985 that the after fair market values of the affected properties were determined and the losses to the plaintiffs assessed. In view of the market value trends during that period - especially the inflated cost of properties from the rampant inflation and historic interest rates - it would be \"oth unfair and preposterous,\" the witness explained, \"to subtract a 1984 [or 1985] figure from an April of 1978 figure\" to arrive at a before and after market value as a basis to assess the gain or loss to the affected properties. It was the sense of the testimony and opinions of the appraiser that the method used was the most feasible to determine that gain or loss in terms of post-July, 1978 dollars.\n\nThe trial court concluded that it was valid for the appraiser, by means of market value trends and comparable sales to explore the full effect of the Alcolac activity as a depressant on the market value of property from July of 1978 [when it first became measurable] until 1984 [when it was fully developed] to derive the after market value of the affected properties - and so allowed the opinions of market value, before and after. The matter of admission of value opinion based upon comparable sales is one of trial court discretion and, under the facts in evidence, falls within the principle of State ex rel. State Highway Comm'n v. Wertz, 478 S.W.2d 670, 675[6,7] (Mo. 1972):\n\n'\"Where evidence of a comparable sale of lease is offered, the trial Judge may, in his discretion, admit or exclude it considering such factors as time of the transaction, size, shape and character of the comparable land, and whether there has been any enhancement or depression in value. It makes no difference whether the transaction occurred before or after the date of condemnation so long as it is not too remote a period of time and the land is reasonably comparable, having been neither enhanced or decreased in value by the project or improvement occasioning the taking. The weight to be given such evidence is for the jury. The trial Judge's determination as to admissibility or nonadmissibility of such evidence will not be upset on appeal unless it is a clear abuse of discretion.\"\n\nThe value opinions of appraiser Blaylock were properly received.\n\nWe reject also the insistent and redundant argument Alcolac makes that there was, in any event, no evidence that \"any plaintiff's use of property was damaged by toxic chemicals within this 3-month period\" - that is between April of 1978 and July of 1978. Our Discussion on the negligence causes of action that from the very commencement of the Alcolac operations the plaintiffs were at least discomforted, and already felt physical effects, of the toxic emissions from that source.\n\nThe nuisance causes of action were proven and properly submitted.\n\nWe reject also the assertions of trial error Alcolac contends prejudiced the property damage verdicts so as to require new trials. Those contentions for new trial were those asserted as to the nuisance causes of action and rejected. The two claims of error our opinion sustains - the exploitation of the evidence of unquantified risk of cancer and of a condition called chemically induced AIDS - impinge only on personal injury compensatory and punitive damages, and not at all on the property damages awards returned on the nuisance causes of actions.\n\nThe judgments entered on the property damage awards returned on the nuisance causes of action are affirmed.\n\nPART THREE\n\nAppeal of the Plaintiffs\n\nAfter a trial of more than four months, the jury returned verdicts against Alcolac and awarded to each of the thirty-one plaintiffs on the negligence causes of action for personal injury, $200,000 as compensatory damages and $1,387,096.07 as punitive damages. The court set aside all the awards of both compensatory and punitive damages. The ground for the order as to compensatory damages was that identical verdicts under the evidence most favorable to the plaintiffs were inconsistent with and irreconcilable to each other, and thus impermissible as a matter of law. That ground was also declared to set aside the awards of punitive damages. The punitive damage awards were set aside on additional grounds: 1) the aggregate amount of punitive damages exceeds \"by almost three times the net worth of and thus impermissible as a matter of law \" because such verdicts amount to confiscation of Alcolac's property without due process of law and 2) punitive damages amount to penal sanctions, so the submission of that issue by MAI 10.02 \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e94\u003c/span\u003e conjointly with MAI 3.01, \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e95\u003c/span\u003e which requires only a simply belief of the jury that Alcolac acted with complete indifference to or conscious disregard for the safety of the plaintiffs rather than by beyond a reasonable doubt, \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e96\u003c/span\u003e deprived Alcolac of equal protection of the laws.\n\nThe memorandum appended to the judgment explained that the order to set aside the awards of actual and punitive damages in the negligence cases and for a new trial on those issues was not an exercise of discretionary power, but rested on legal grounds alone: that the verdicts were \"illegal per se.\"\n\nWe affirm the judgment to set aside the awards of actual and punitive damages in the negligence cases and for a new trial limited to those issues, but expressly repudiate that those verdicts as returned by the jury are illegal per se, as the judgment of the trial court has it. We decide rather, that the reception into the proceedings of evidence and argument of unquantified risk of cancer and chemically induced AIDS as elements of personal injury actual and punitive damages were prejudicial to the verdicts, and that the failure of the trial court to grant a new trial on damages on those grounds was error.\n\nI\n\nIdentical Verdicts as Ground for New Trial\n\nA\n\nActual Damages\n\nThe memorandum of judgment found the negligence personal injury verdicts, for punitive as well as actual damages, illegal per se because all thirty-one plaintiffs were awarded identical sums. The memorandum reasoned that the evidence was that the plaintiffs were of different genders, ages, life habits, medical histories, life expectancies, exhibited disparate complaints, received disparate diagnoses and prognoses - therefore, the verdicts returned in identical amounts were not only inconsistent with the evidence, but irreconcilable with each other, and so illegal per se. The premise of the order, therefore, is the fact of thirty-one identical verdicts. That is to say: the illegality the court discerns is that, although the evidence of damages was not the same as to all of the plaintiffs, the award of damages was. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e97\u003c/span\u003e\n\nIn fact, there was a remarkable commonality of disease among the thirty-one plaintiffs attributable by expert opinion to the prolonged exposure to the Alcolac toxins. They all suffered acute effects to the upper respiratory system, or the skin, or to the eyes. The liver organ systems of all of them were affected by disease or dysfunction manifested by chemical hepatitis, or abnormal porphyrin metabolism, or abnormal lipid metabolism, or abnormal protein metabolism - in some combination. The immune systems of all but two of them were either suppressed, disregulated or in dysfunction. The seven males who submitted to the test of the reproductive function all manifested some abnormality. The peripheral nervous systems of a preponderant number of the plaintiffs were diseased from the exposure, as were the 8th cranial nerve - with attendant loss of hearing. These, and other diseases and bodily dysfunctions were not only demonstrated by laboratory tests, but diagnosed as existent, irreversible, and progressive. To be sure, as the trial court order and memorandum of judgment comments, the degree of disease diagnosed as well as the prognosis differed among the plaintiffs, as did the life expectancies, and hence the cost of medical care - all elements that bear to prove damages. Even as to one item of reasonably certain future medical need [the surveillance of the damaged immune systems of the plaintiffs], the provable expense, and hence damage, varied according to the life expectancy of each plaintiff. That ranged from 10.67 years for 75-year-old Virgil Bradley to 71.06 years for eleven-year-old Amber Cross.\n\nThat said, the order of the trial court to set aside the thirty-one verdicts as \"illegal\" because the damage awards as to all the plaintiffs were identical, although the evidence was not, remains in error. The rigid logic which fashions the order slights the degree of freedom and discretion our system of law accords a jury on issues of damages.\n\nIt derives first of all from the institutional arrangements under which the jury is permitted to deliberate in private and to report its decision out by general verdict . . . Its basic device is the general damage instruction itself which can do no more than convey to the jury the large headings under which it may award damages. Since these are so broad the chief message of the instructions to the jury is to tell them how free they are.\n\nKalven, The Jury, The Law, and the Personal Property Injury Damage Award, 19 Ohio St. L.J. 158, 160 (1958). MAI 4.01, under which the damage awards were assessed by the jury, is of that ilk.\n\nThis action was brought as thirteen petitions by thirty-two plaintiffs, each petition a multiple-count suit by members of a family. The petitioners were consolidated as a single action under Rule 66.01 by order of the trial court on the motion of Alcolac. Alcolac cannot argue that - had each plaintiff brought a separate petition on which each, in turn, an award of $200,000 as actual damages was returned by the jury on different evidence - the verdicts would have been \"inconsistent\" and hence \"illegal.\" Alcolac can no more argue that as to separate suits consolidated for convenient judicial management and tried as one than as to separate suits tried seriatim.\n\nIn Page v. Hamilton, 329 S.W.2d 758 (Mo. 1959), our supreme court posed the question, at 765, as\n\n\"whether a result, legally acceptable when achieved by different verdicts in separate trials on the same set of facts, becomes erroneous because of inconsistency when accomplished by a general verdict in a single trial of separate causes of action joined in the same suit by authority of [court rule]. . . .\n\nand responded, at 766[10, 11]:\n\n\"If we adhere to a rule of consistency in this situation the alternatives would be to separate the trials and permit to be done indirectly that which is unseemly if done directly; or to retry the joined causes repeatedly until a verdict is returned which is acceptable to the court's view of consistency.\n\n\"'The answer to this argument must be that the law imposes no requirement of consistency upon jurors hearing separate cases which are consolidated for purposes of trial. If such separate cases were being tried separately, by different juries, there would be no assurance of consistency in the verdicts, and no greater assurance of consistency is insisted upon when one jury tries both cases together.\n\n\"'Inconsistency in verdicts in actions tried together is not a ground for setting aside the judgment in one of the actions on appeal unless such judgment is based on error.'\"\n\nSee also Brown v. Michigan Miller Mut. Ins. Co., 665 S.W.2d 630, 636 (Mo. App. 1983).\n\nThat is to say, the jury is free to report its decision of damages by general verdict on its view of the evidence. And, ordinarily, a general verdict is conclusive as to the questions of fact properly submitted. In that exercise, no party \"has any priority or pre-emptive right to particular evidence or inferences to be drawn therefrom.\" Page, supra, 329 S.W.2d at 766[10, 11]. Nor - as Alcolac suggests - are the private deliberations which culminate as a general verdict open to inquiry or impeachment for faulty logic, misconceived evidence or mistaken calculations. These remain matters which \"'\" alone in the juror's breast.\"'\" \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e98\u003c/span\u003e Elmore v. Owens-Illinois, Inc., 673 S.W.2d 434, 439 (Mo. banc 1984)' Anderson v. Independent Mut. Fire Ins. Co., 453 S.W.2d 609, 614[4-7] (Mo. App. 1970). Alcolac cites Claspill v. Craig, 586 S.W.2d 458 (Mo. App. 1979), where the court set aside twelve verdicts of $500 for each of the twelve defendants on their counterclaim. Contrary to the tenor of the Alcolac argument, however, the verdicts in Claspill were annulled not because they were identical, but because the evidence of damage was too \"sketchy and vague\" to prove $500 as to any of the counterclaimants. 586 S.W.2d at 461[3,4].\n\nThere is no contention here [the claim for increased risk of cancer disallowed] that $200,000 in actual damages was not prove even as to a single plaintiff. Nor can there be. The various manifestations of bodily disease and dysfunction diagnosed as to each of the plaintiffs by Dr. Carnow, and reported in the detail of our opinion, rest on substantial evidence. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e99\u003c/span\u003e Quite apart from the irreversible bodily damage and disease diagnosed and proven distinctively for each of the plaintiffs, the experts agree that surveillance for early detection of further disease as to persons chronically exposed to chemicals such as the Alcolac toxins is a necessary medical procedure. That surveillance, the experts agree, includes annual panels to monitor the immune system -- a bodily function many of the identified Alcolac toxins adversely affect and suppress. That procedure alone, according to immunologist Zahalsky, entails a cost of $1000 per person at the current rate. There were those - Virgil Bradley, Dorothy Bradley, Malva Gehlken and Dainie Landon - who already exhibit severe immune system dysfunction so as to necessitate biannual panels for the rest of their lives. That surveillance alone, over their life expectancies comes to no less than $20,000 for any of the plaintiffs and, for Amber Cross, more than $70,000. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e100\u003c/span\u003e This accumulated evidence, no doubt, dissuaded the court from reposing its order for new trial on damages \"on the sufficiency of the evidence or the weight thereof.\"\n\nThe freedom and discretion of a jury to return an award of damages under a general verdict, nevertheless, are not beyond some control by the court. It may be set aside as against the weight of the evidence - an option of discretionary action the trial court explicitly spurned. There were other alternatives. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e101\u003c/span\u003e The order to set aside the actual damage verdicts rests, rather, unconditionally on the perceived \"illegality\" of thirty-one identical awards - notwithstanding the sufficiency of the evidence to sustain them all. The jury awards for actual damages were legal and the order of the trial court to grant new trials on the issue of damages on the ground ascribed was error.\n\nB\n\nPunitive Damages\n\nAn award of $1,387,096.07 as punitive damages was returned for each of the thirty-one plaintiffs. The identity, and hence illegality, of the verdicts apart, the court set aside the awards on two legal and expressly non-discretionary grounds: 1) the assessed punitive damages in the aggregate of $43,000,000 exceeds the Alcolac net worth by almost three times and hence confiscates property without due process of law and 2) punitive damages is a penal sanction found and imposed by a jury upon simple belief, rather than beyond a reasonable doubt, and so deprives a defendant of the equal protection of the laws.\n\nThe ground of the order to set aside the punitive damage awards as confiscatory in the aggregate rests on the premise of the memorandum of judgment that the net worth of Alcolac was $15,300,000. There was no evidence before the jury of the Alcolac net worth. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e102\u003c/span\u003e There were occasional chamber chats on the subject, and the representation of net worth by counsel for Alcolac, but no evidence of the fact of a $15,300,000 net worth. Alcolac argues that the court was not limited by evidence of net worth to act on the jury awards, but that a reference in the record suffices to inform the court for judicial action. Alcolac alludes to two record sources which sufficiently informed the court for the determination that the awards in aggregate so exceeded net worth as to amount of confiscation. One source was the deposition of Alcolac president Anderson where the witness gave the net worth of the defendant, and the other source was the Alcolac, Inc. Annual Reports for 1979 and 1980, marked by plaintiffs as exhibits, but never tendered or received in evidence. We do not know what the Anderson deposition estimate of net worth was, \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e103\u003c/span\u003e nor was the net worth reported in the Alcolac Annual Reports for 1979 and 1980 extrapolated or explained.\n\nThe Anderson deposition was neither in evidence nor part of the record on appeal by any estimate of that term, nor is there any intimation that the trial court was informed of its content. Nor were the Alcolac annual reports in evidence. Alcolac argues that whether in evidence or not, the trial court \"did in fact review [the annual reports] on his own,\" and so had a sufficiently informed basis to annul the punitive damages award. We do not know that the trial Judge \"did in fact review\" the annual reports, or if he did, that he came to a determination of net worth from that source, or even what that determination was. There is simply no discernible basis either in the evidence or in the record on appeal for the fact of a $15,300,000 net worth from which the court infers confiscatory punitive damages. There is only the insinuation of that estimate as a fact by counsel for Alcolac.\n\nThe want of proof on that issue, however, was not a matter of neglect, but of strategy. The source for that proof [the Alcolac annual reports] and the witness able to interpret those reports [Alcolac president Anderson] and the witness able to interpret those reports [Alcolac president Anderson] were at hand, but the fact of the Alcolac net worth was never elicited. The plaintiffs did not tender the annual reports for proof of net worth because they distrusted the integrity of those financial statements. Alcolac did not tender any evidence of net worth, presumably, to avoid any untoward inferences of hostile examination. In fact, the plaintiffs called Anderson as a witness and examined him on the annual reports, but for another reason. The aim of examination was to establish that his emoluments, in addition to salary, included an incentive bonus based upon 2 percent of the Alcolac consolidated net income. From that, further questions undertook to create the inference that Anderson [an architect of the Alcolac budgets] neglected the WAPORA recommendations for environmental control systems in order to ensure greater incentive bonuses for himself. The questions also undertook to create the inference that the annual report figures were contrived to meliorate the incentive bonus, and so the financial reports lacked integrity. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e104\u003c/span\u003e\n\nThere was no evidence of Alcolac net worth before the jury, nor was there any other reliable source for that fact available to the trial court. It is open to a trial court to interfere with a punitive damage award where \"it plainly appears that the verdict was so out of all proper proportions as to reveal improper motives and an absence of honest exercise of judgment by the jury in its rendition.\" Jones v. West Side Buick Auto Co., 231 Mo. App. 187, 93 S.W.2d 1083, 1089[13,14] (1936); Peak v. W. T. Grant Co. 386 S.W.2d 685, 694[20-21] (Mo. App. 1965). The order of the trial court, however couched, rests on the failure of the jury to exercise an honest judgment on evidence it never heard. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e105\u003c/span\u003e The premise of the order - that the punitive damage awards in the aggregate exceed the Alcolac net worth by more than three times and so are confiscatory - is without basis in the evidence or record, and so is erroneous.\n\nThe order of the trial court sets aside the punitive damage awards on yet the other constitutional ground that the instructions upon which the jury gave redress denied Alcolac the equal protection of the laws - in that the defendant was subjected to punitive sanctions under instructions couched in terms of burden of proof applicable to civil tort and not to criminal tort. The punitive damages element was submitted to the jury by verdict director MAI 10.02. The burden of proof was submitted by MAI 3.01. MAI 3.01 instructs that the jury may return a verdict based upon a simple belief of the propositions necessary for verdict. MAI 10.02 is the model for punitive damages based on negligence and allow the return of award \"if [the jury] believe\" that the conduct of Alcolac, as submitted in the negligence verdict director,\n\nshowed complete indifference to or conscious disregard for the safety of others, then in addition to any damages to which you may find plaintiff entitled under [MAI 4.01] you may award plaintiff an additional amount as punitive damages in such sum as you believe will serve to punish defendant and to deter defendant and others from like conduct. [emphasis added]\n\nThe memorandum of judgment not only grounds the equal protection deficiency on the application of the civil burden of proof to the return of a penal sanction, but also on the vagueness of the direction to the jury that the punitive award may be in such sum as the jury believe \"will serve to punish defendant and to deter defendant and others from like conduct.\"\n\nIt is evident that this articulation of judgment, whatever its constitutional garb, is an attack on the validity of the model instructions promulgated by our supreme court for the submission of punitive damages in negligence cases. A court of appeals has no authority to declare invalid a model instruction duly promulgated by the supreme court under its power to establish rules of practice, procedure and pleading granted by Article V, § 5, Constitution of Missouri of 1945 as amended August 3, 1976. Any such rule may be annulled or amended only by the supreme court or by a law limited to that purpose. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e106\u003c/span\u003e Nor, since such a rule has the force and effect of a statute, \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e107\u003c/span\u003e and the supreme court is vested with exclusive appellate jurisdiction in all cases involving the validity of a statute, \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e108\u003c/span\u003e may we entertain the question the judgment and Alcolac pose.\n\nOur affirmance of the trial court judgment for remand of the negligence causes of action on the issue of damages only, in any event, rests on grounds of testimony prejudicial to the jury treatment of punitive damages, and not because of identical damage awards or constitutional infirmity of instructions. We observe that Alcolac cites no decision of our courts or of the United States Supreme Court \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e109\u003c/span\u003e which disallows punitive damages in a civil case as a constitutional infringement or even as a matter of unfairness. We notice, rather, that newly enacted § 510.263, RSMo Supp. 1987 assumes that continued efficacy of punitive damages as a redress for aggravated tortious conduct, restores the power of remittitur, and adopts other procedures meant to ensure even more just adjudications of the issue.\n\nC\n\nSubmissibility of Punitive Damages\n\nThe trial court order does not posit, nor does Alcolac argue, that plaintiffs failed to show as to the defendant that \"complete indifference to or conscious disregard for the safety of others\" MAI 10.02 requires a jury to believe as the premise for a punitive damages award. In that context, complete indifference or conscious disregard, our supreme court en banc holds in Hoover's Dairy, Inc. v. Mid-America Dairymen, 700 S.W.2d 426 (Mo. banc 1985), means [at 436[17,18]\n\nthe defendant knew or had reason to know that there was a high degree of probability that the action would result in injury.\n\nWe deem that the evidence proved the negligence conduct submitted: that Alcolac loaded the bioponds beyond their design capacity, allowed unfiltered toxic waste to discharge directly into the bioponds, operated the liquid incinerator in such a manner as to discharge toxic chemicals into the atmosphere, and failed to prevent stored chemicals from escape into the atmosphere, and that at the time Alcolac acted [or failed to act] Alcolac knew or had reason to know that there was a high degree of probability that its conduct would result in injury. We deem, therefore, that the issue of liability for punitive damages was submissible on the evidence before the jury and, as our opinion determines, was concluded by the verdicts.\n\nAlcolac commenced production operations at the Sedalia site in May of 1978. Even before construction, at the stage of design, there was great concern over the effect of the production process on the environment. That was because, as Alcolac vice-president and director of operations explained, numerous of the chemicals used in the monomer process were hazardous and toxic. The types of chemicals and raw materials that would be used in production, as Farmer reported to the DNR for licensure before operations commenced, and those other compounds identified as toxic and even carcinogenic in the later evidence. It was openly acknowledged not only by Farmer, but all of the management cadre, that numerous of the monomer chemicals were hazardous and toxic. In his comments to the townsfolk and officials of Sedalia called prior to the commencement of operations to allay environmental concerns, Farmer explained that \"a large percentage of these materials create either toxic, hazardous, flammable, even carcinogenic conditions.\" His reassurance to them was, as was his testimony, that \"these problems\" would be managed by the environmental control systems designed for the plant. There can be no doubt, therefore, that Alcolac had actual knowledge that their monomer production process used and created toxic and hazardous chemicals which - if allowed to emit from the premises and expose persons in the environs to them - was attended by a high degree of probability that injury would result. We accept as foregone, in any event, that a producer who installs an environmental control system to treat toxic wastes already knows the danger to others not involved in the production process from exposure to those wastes.\n\nThat is only to say, however, that by the nature of the activity carried on by the defendant, any breach of ordinary care by Alcolac to persons in the environs was attended by a \"high degree of probability that the action would result in injury.\" Those exposed to the Alcolac acrylates, for instance, experienced the injury of skin, eye, nose and respiratory irritations - even if those emissions were only carelessly released. However, \"omething more than the mere commission of a tort is always required for punitive damages. There must be circumstances of aggravation. . . .\" Prosser and Keeton, The Law of Torts § 2 (5th ed. 1984). In our law, to prove punitive damages, the negligent conduct must amount to a \"complete indifference to the rights of others which proves punitive damages. Hoover's Dairy, Inc. v. Mid-America Dairymen, 700 S.W.2d at 435.\n\nThe evidence for punitive damages submissions was abundant:\n\nAlcolac was designed as a state of the art zero discharge plant. Odorous, toxic and hazardous vapors, liquids and sediments were waste products of the soap and monomer processes. It was the theory of the design that any such wastes would be contained within the plant for harmless disposal. Whatever the purpose of the design. Alcolac never operated as a self-contained, closed system. From the first, toxic and odorous wastes were emitted by Alcolac into the atmosphere over the environs in the form of haze, smoke, suds, vapors, acid mist and residues.\n\nThere were many reasons.\n\nThe intricate, state of the science environmental control systems installed in the plant were meant to be operated by an environmental control engineer trained for that function. It was put in the charge rather, first in the hands of a person who was discharged for drunkenness, and then in the charge of a youth - a maintenance employee and high school dropout without any formal training of instruction. It was not until July of 1980 that a trained engineer, Mark Blowers, was given that duty. [He remained for two years]. In the course of the two years between May of 1978, when Alcolac operations commenced and July of 1980 when Blowers assumed charge of the environmental control building, the vital controls did not function properly as a closed system. The acid scrubbers in the soap building did not function much of the time, so that the vapors were not cleansed before emission into the atmosphere, but remained odorous and caustic. The liquid discharged into the bioponds from the soap factory remained full of suds and became a source of odors as well as a means of transport around the country side of the toxic compounds from the monomer building with which they mixed. The carbon filter beds regularly shifted so that the wastes went through to emission without adsorption of the toxic contaminants, contrary to the purpose of a closed system. The liquid incinerator, designed as the means of disposal of the waste stream of toxic particulates from the monomer process failed in function in December of 1978 - only seven months after commencement of production - but was continued in use, and belched toxic smoke and haze into the atmosphere.\n\nAlcolac failed as a closed system also because the personnel were neither trained nor encouraged to contain the toxic pollutants within the plant for treatment and disposal. There was no safety program, nor training, nor operation manual to guide them. Toxic chemical spills were common, and were often pushed into the drains with squeegees, rather than through the filtration beds before emission into the biopond. The toxic liquid wastes from the monomer process were also regularly routed directly into the biopond without prior decontamination. From there, they evaporated into the atmosphere, mixed with the suds to be borne around the area, or remained in the biopond to combine with other effluents from the monomer process to synergize into even more potent toxicity. The excess vapors and fumes of sulphur trioxide from the soap plant were merely released into the atmosphere by opening the factory doors. There was no plan to capture and treat the toxic vapors from the raw materials stored on the premises or transferred from transports into the plant. They were stored on the Alcolac grounds in thousands of drums, and not within a structure, so that the toxic fumes and liquids from the frequent leaks from corrosion or mishaps with transport trucks were not contained, but simply evaporated into the ambient air or seeped into the ground.\n\nAlcolac failed as a closed system also because the production consistently exceeded design. The liquid toxic waste generated by production simply was beyond the capacity of the bioponds to biodegrade. Instead, a sludge of toxic sediment formed and engendered not only odors, but dangerous chemical mixtures and vapors.\n\nThese effects were not merely the results of careless lapses in machines, methods and management. They were consequences of deliberate business decisions taken by Alcolac. A jury could have understood from the evidence that the decisions to forgo an environmental control engineer, the redesign of the bioponds to accommodate the increased organic load from the increased production, the correction of the acid scrubbers, the installation of hydrocarbon monitors, and other pollution control measures were prompted by the motives of Alcolac president Anderson to spare expense in order to enhance the profit on which his bonus depended.\n\nThere was other evidence from which a jury could find that Alcolac knew that these and other mispractices and deficiencies in the environmental control system were, unless corrected, a continued threat and danger to persons exposed to the chemical wastes which resulted, but that Alcolac, with complete, reckless - even arrogant - indifference, nevertheless allowed them to go uncorrected.\n\nThe complaints of the residents around Alcolac of injurious fumes, haze, vapors and odors from the plant began soon after the commencement of production in May of 1978. Those complaints never abated and came to the attention of the Missouri Department of Natural Resources. Odors from the Alcolac premises were palpable, the liquid incinerator generated haze into the atmosphere, the bioponds gave off the scent of hydrogen sulfide and other chemicals, suds blew off the bioponds onto the properties in the environs, and caustic vapors and sediments irritated the skin, eyes an respiration of those on whom they impinged. Citations for excessive emissions issued against Alcolac, as did notice of violations. As a consequence, the efficacy and operation of the Alcolac environmental control system came under the scrutiny of DNR as early as September of 1978, only four months after the commencement of production. It was then that, for the first time, was mentioned the installation of a recording hydrocarbon detector on the stacks to analyze the organic content of the emissions. There were other elements of the environmental control systems that DNR deemed needed further attention.\n\nAlcolac called in WAPORA, its subsidiary - an environmental consultant with international reputation - to investigate and make suggestions. WAPORA reported in the summer of 1978 the problems for correction: No trained competent engineer responsible for the pollution control systems; lack of monitors at the vents to identify and measure any chemicals which might be escaping; the recurrent overload of the bioponds from excessive production as high as eighteen times beyond design capacity; the liquid incinerator malfunction so that toxins escaped into the atmosphere; training of employees and instruction in the Environmental Control Systems Operating Manual devised for the plant by WAPORA to correct the current haphazard handling of chemicals - and other problems. Anderson of Alcolac in the meanwhile asked Bregman of WAPORA to meet with an environmental committee of Sedalia citizens to allay their concerns. Bregman understood that the WAPORA recommendations would be implemented by Alcolac, and so assured the citizens that the air pollution problems would be resolved. The recommendation were rejected, however, by president Anderson as too costly. Anderson then dismissed WAPORA altogether from the Sedalia project in December of 1979, the problems went uncorrected, and the pollution continued. Thus, Anderson not only gave no heed to WAPORA, an affiliate Alcolac management considered its \"in-house consulting group,\" but also discontinued its services. Anderson did call upon Bregman once again after the commencement of these suits, but to ask that he destroy the WAPORA file on the Sedalia project. Bregman refused.\n\nThe pollution from Alcolac did not abate, nor did the effects, and the complaints continued. The environmental engineer WAPORA deemed so essential to the management of the pollution control system was finally employed in mid-1980 and remained for two years. But the employee mispractices and equipment failure continued, and so did the toxic pollution. The liquid incinerator still malfunctioned, the bioponds still gave off odors and suds, the employees still opened the doors to vent spills and excess vapors into the atmosphere rather than to dispose of them within the closed system, and they still routed the monomer wastes around the filtration environmental controls directly into the bioponds where they evaporated or were carried away in the suds. The bioponds were never monitored for toxicity, nor were the vapors or fumes at the points of emission. The liquid incinerator malfunctioned since December of 1978 - only seven months after commencement of production - and continued into year 1981. It was the function of that system to destroy the toxic organic contaminants from the monomer process so that a harmless vapor remained for emission through the stack. The malfunction of the incinerator meant that any matter injected for disposal would only partially burn, or not at all, so that the toxins emitted without change or, if partially changed, into countless toxic components. The malfunction was so complete that Alcolac vice-president Bouroff officially commented to Alcolac president Anderson:\n\nOur liquid incinerator has the poorest performance ever seen. Most of the time it is out of commission due to all kinds of mechanical problems. It is an absolute waste of time and money. We consider it a 100% failure and the most costly operation. Also, part of our environmental problems were/are caused by this piece of equipment. [empasis added] That memorandum was dated May of 1980. Notwithstanding the environmental dangers a malfunctioned incinerator entailed, the use continued for more than a year. In fact, the liquid incinerator had been \"out\" since December of 1978, as an earlier memorandum from Bouroff to Anderson advised. Thus, for almost three years, instead of harmless vapors, the liquid incinerator emitted into the atmosphere and exposed persons in the environs to a multi-farious assortment of toxins and carcinogens. A jury could find from that and other evidence that Alcolac was not only negligent, but acted with complete and reckless indifference to the rights of those around them.\n\nTo finally resolve the problem of odor emissions, Alcolac entered into an abatement agreement with the Missouri Department of Natural Resources and undertook nine actions. Among them were the agreement to install a hydrocarbon monitor to sample the emissions from each stack of the vapor incinerator and carbon adsorption system in the monomer building, and to implement a system to determine on a one-time basis the nature and concentration of the emissions from the stacks of the vapor incinerator and carbon adsorption system for each product manufactured in the monomer building. Alcolac also agreed to develop a plan for the training of employees as to the control of odorous emissions from sources at the facility. The abatement agreement was entered on May 30, 1980. The hydrocarbon monitor with alarm was to be installed by January of 1981. It was not fully installed until May of 1984 - more than three years later, and more than six years after the first recommendation for such a pollution control by DNR to Alcolac. The system to determine on a one-time, product-by-product basis the nature and concentration and nature of the emissions from the stacks was never installed. Thus, there was no way to identify or measure with any definiteness the kind of concentration of any chemical emission from the monomer process. Alcolac did ultimately, as required by the abatement agreement, develop an approved plan for the training of employees as to the control of odorous emissions at the facility. The odorous emissions continued nevertheless, as did the intrusions of foam, the spills at the plant, and the official notices to Alcolac to excessive emissions. These continued almost to the date of trial in 1985.\n\nThis evidence, once again, suffices to prove conduct by Alcolac, not merely negligent, but reckless and utterly indifferent to the rights of the plaintiffs. The submissions for punitive damages were proper.\n\nPART FOUR\n\nThe Appellate Judgment\n\nWe affirm the judgments of the trial court, but for the reasons our opinion gives.\n\nThe judgments for property damage entered on the verdicts returned on the nuisance causes of action are affirmed.\n\nThe judgments for new trials on the issue of damages only on the negligence caused of action are affirmed.\n\nOur opinion determines, as do the judgments for partial new trials, that the liability of Alcolac to the plaintiffs was proven by substantial evidence and adjudicated without significant error. Our opinion determines, therefore, that as to the negligence causes of action, Alcolac breached its duty of care to the plaintiffs, and that such neglect caused them personal injury. In terms of a toxic tort negligence cause of action, this means that all the components of cause in fact have been proven and adjudicated without significant error as to each plaintiff:\n\n[1] exposure by the plaintiff to an identified\n\nharmful substance significant enough to\n\nactivate disease.\n\n[2] a demonstrable relationship between the\n\nsubstance and biological disease\n\n[3] diagnosis of such disease in the plaintiff\n\n[4] expert opinion that the disease found in\n\nthe plaintiff is consistent with exposure\n\nto the harmful substance\n\n[5] defendant was responsible for the etiologic\n\nagent of the disease diagnosed in the\n\nplaintiff\n\nOur opinion concludes, as do necessarily the judgments for partial new trials, that the diagnosis of biological injury, disease and dysfunction Dr. Carnow entered for each of the thirty-one plaintiffs as attributable to exposure to the Alcolac toxins is derived by valid scientific principle, based on competent scientific proof, and rests on substantial evidence.\n\nWhat remains upon remand is to determine the money damages due each plaintiff as compensation for the personal injury already proven, and the amount of punitive damages. The manifestations of disease and dysfunction from the chronic systemic chemical intoxication diagnosed by Dr. Carnow as the biological damage to each plaintiff caused by the Alcolac toxic chemicals and entered on the DIAGNOSIS chart [except as we presently note] rest on substantial evidence and define the bodily injury proven. We find three lapses in the otherwise meticulous proof of the manifestations of biological damage attributable to Alcolac: There is no medical basis for the manifestation of reproductive system dysfunction entered for Dainie Landon. He could not produce a specimen for fertility analysis, and hence that manifestation does not rest on substantial evidence and was not proven. There is no medical basis, by test result, clinical procedure or other explanation for the abnormal protein or abnormal porphyrin metabolism components of the diagnosis entered for John Lawrence. Those entries were mistaken and were not proven. There is no medical basis of explanation for the hypertension - mild entered for Bernice Miller, and hence that manifestation was not proven.\n\nTo facilitate the task of the jury upon an eventual retrial, and to subserve the efficient judicial management of this still massive litigation, the court may set aside, suspend, or modify the order of consolidation of the thirty-one claims and submit the issue of damages by the single claim, or other judicial unit, as convenience and fairness may prompt. Wolfner v. Miller, 711 S.W.2d 580, 582[1,2] (Mo. App. 1986); Keeling v. Randall, 386 S.W.2d 67, 69[4] (Mo. banc 1965); Rule 66.02. The provisions of § 510.163, RSMo Supp. 1987, also bear on the trial procedures where punitive damages are an issue for adjudication. In such cases, a party may request the bifurcation of the issues of liability for and award of compensatory damages from the issues of liability for award of punitive damages for separate trial. The liability for compensatory and punitive damages is already concluded. What remains of this litigation is for the jury to adjudicate the amount of compensatory damages and of punitive damages due each plaintiff. To subserve sound judicial management and principles of fairness, the court may - even absent request - dissever those issues for separate trial and submission to the jury. State ex rel. Blond v. Stubbs, 485 S.W.2d 153, 158[10] (Mo. App. 1972); Rule 66.02.\n\nIt is a desideratum of the statute [§ 510.263.4] that a defendant not be required to pay redundant punitive damages based on the same conduct. To accommodate that end - in these circumstances of a liability for punitive damages already adJudged in favor of thirty-one plaintiffs - the court may aptly under Rule 66.01(b) submit to the jury for verdict the common issue of the sum that will serve to punish and deter Alcolac and others from like conduct [MAI 10.02] rendered as a single sum and apportioned separately by verdict as to each plaintiff. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e110\u003c/span\u003e\n\nThe costs of the action are assessed two-thirds against the defendant Alcolac and one-third against the plaintiffs.\n\nCharles Shangler\n\nPresiding Judge\n\nAPPENDIX A\n\n[SEE APPENDIX IN ORIGINAL]\n\nAPPENDIX B\n\n[SEE APPENDIX IN ORIGINAL]\n\nAPPENDIX C\n\n[SEE APPENDIX IN ORIGINAL]\n\nAPPENDIX D\n\n[SEE APPENDIX IN ORIGINAL]\n\nAPPENDIX E\n\nBerry family group\n\nCarl D. Berry and wife Ethel [age 73] lived on their 3 1/2 acre tract since 1942. The land lies some 3/4ths of a mile south of Alcolac. Carl was disabled from some cause extraneous to the suit and joined only for remedy for damage to the real estate. He died during the pendency of appeal and wife Ethel succeeded to that interest. Carl C. Berry [age 54] and wife Jacqueline [age 55] live on the tract which adjoins the parental land on the northeast.\n\nEthel Berry\n\nShe has lived on the property since 1942 and has never detected any odors from Missouri Pacific Railroad yards, already there. It was not until Alcolac commenced operations in May of 1978 that she was subjected to any odors or fumes or other noticeable emission. Since then until the present odors of rotten eggs, sulphur, and gas had come from Alcolac recurrently, depending upon the wind direction or calm. There have been and continue to be incidents of smoke and mist emissions from Alcolac in the early morning and late at night. A powder covers the ground and vegetation, suds and foam fill the air and alight on her property, and black soot descends on her property from Alcolac explosions.\n\nInhalation and contact with these emissions cause her eyes to itch and water, sore throats, burning in the nose and chest, nosebleeds, headaches, depression, chills, rashes and blisters over the body, swelling of the legs, numbness, cramps and tingling of the legs, and difficulty in breathing. She kept a garden, fruit trees, and raised chickens. In April of 1983 after an incident of unusual smoke and fumes, 26 of their 100 chickens died. They also lost some hive bees.\n\nHer includes a condition of arthritis and borderline diabetes.\n\nShe consumes no alcohol, nor smokes, and drinks no more than two cups of coffee per day.\n\nShe complained to the Sedalia mayor about the odors and fumes, but to no avail.\n\nCarl C. Berry\n\nHe and wife Jacqueline have lived on the lot since 1959, but left in 1977 and returned in 1979 and live there still.\n\nWhen he returned in 1979, the odors from Alcolac were palpable and resembled the scent of lacquer and at times that of a very strong acid. There was also dark black smoke from the Alcolac operations -- fifty or sixty times -- which has come over the property and given off a sour odor. A white powder covers the grass and vegetation and black specks cover the car and outer surface of the residence. Foam and suds from the Alcolac ponds rise to a great height, like a \"white mountain,\" travel through the air onto his property in \"huge pieces three feet across.\" There were no such incidents before his return to the property in 1979. The white substance causes a rash on the skin and eyes to burn. The odors cause regular headaches, chest pains, eyes to burn and water, sore nose, rapid heart beat, cramps in arms and legs, skin itch, shortness of breath.\n\nThe cattle he keeps are affected by the odors and fumes; all have runny eyes and a sore on one of them does not heal. He no longer keeps a garden or grow crops because the powdery white matter and black specks he attributes to Alcolac impair their growth. Carl Berry is a construction worker who lays asphalt on the highway. He worked for a while as a spray painter, and for a while installed foam insulation. He no longer smokes although he smoked a pack of cigarettes a day for seventeen years, until 1969.\n\nHis includes back pain caused by a short leg; and episode of chest pain in 1971, and another from the inhalation of carbon monoxide at work in 1981. He complained to the Sedalia mayor about the Alcolac odors and fumes, as well as to the DNR, but to no avail.\n\nJacqueline Berry\n\nShe noticed the odor and fumes from Alcolac upon their return in 1979. She had never experienced odors during her prior residence there from 1958 to 1977 from any source. She could not describe the odors, other than as obnoxious. They were constant when the wind was out of the north or northeast. At times the haze and vapors from Alcolac were so dense that even the image of the plant was obscured. An explosion at the plant in 1981 blew the roof off Alcolac. She observed \"great big bunches\" of foam and suds fly by the window and \"slam\" into their property. The odors were terrible and continued to the time of the trial. The odors caused headaches, eyes and nose to burn, blurred vision, congestion in the lungs and throat, fatigue, shortness of breath, skin rashes, cramps and numbness in the calves, arms and hands, loss of memory and hearing decrease. She has part-time employment with J. C. Penney. She has smoked half a pack a day for twenty-five years; drinks coffee, and has a drink of alcohol a couple of times a year.\n\nHer includes a lens implant after the removal of a cataract; varicose veins and sinus difficulty.\n\nShe reported the odors to Alcolac, the Sedalia mayor and councilmen, but to no avail.\n\nBradley family group\n\nVirgil Bradley [age 75] and Dorothy Bradley [age 74] lived on the 16 acre tract 4/10ths of a mile north and west of Alcolac from 1955 to 1984, when they moved residence into the city of Sedalia to escape the odors and fumes from Alcolac.\n\nVirgil Bradley\n\nHe was employed at the Missouri Pacific Railroad yards in Sedalia from 1947 to 1962. He had never experienced any foul odors from that or other sources until Alcolac commenced operations in May of 1978. He described the odors from Alcolac as the scent of rotten eggs and separately, as a sweet odor. Also, suds and foam from Alcolac floated over and onto their land many times, fragmented as \"big as a washtub.\" The odors and fumes cause the eyes to burn, headaches, coughs, sleepiness and dizziness, tiredness, pains in the chest, rashes on the skin, vomiting, tingling and numbness in the hands, legs and feet, pains in the chest and shortness of breath.\n\nThe odors are most frequent and intense when the wind is from the south.\n\nHe and his wife would escape from the odors by trips away from the home, some times all day long.\n\nThe discomfort and annoyance were so great that they moved into Sedalia proper at the end of 1984, but still own the residence near Alcolac. They return there every night to feed the cat, and the odors persist.\n\nHis includes the loss of the right arm in an industrial accident and varicose veins.\n\nHe does not smoke, consumes no alcohol and drinks a very occasional cup of coffee.\n\nHe complained of the odors and suds to the county officials, the DNR, the sheriff and police, but to no avail.\n\nDorothy Bradley\n\nShe first noticed odors from any source after Alcolac commenced operations in May of 1978. The odors were of rotten eggs and of chemicals. There was also haze and smoke from Alcolac, as well as foam and suds. The emissions cause headaches, aches in the eyeballs, vomiting, sleepiness, sore throat, hoarseness, and loss of memory. The odors are more frequent and noticeable when the wind is from the south. To escape the odors, the Bradleys went to Liberty Park west of Sedalia, and then moved away at the end of 1984. They return daily to feed the cats, but the odors remain.\n\nHer includes a lump removed from the breast.\n\nElam family group\n\nClarence Elam [age 64] and Betty Elam [age 59] live on a nine acre tract one-half mile southwest of Alcolac. They have occupied the premises since 1972 with the daughter, plaintiff Linda Lou Elam [now Sanders, age 23], who married, and now lives in Texas.\n\nClarence Elam\n\nThe Elams live about 1/4 mile from the Missouri Pacific Railroad yards and near Missouri Pressed Metals and have never detected any foul odors or scents from those sources. The odors commenced in 1978 after Alcolac commenced operations. The odors were of lacquer and of \"hot radiators.\" There were also episodes of foam and suds which alighted on their property, in fragments as big as a \"large refrigerator.\" There was also smoke and haze from Alcolac. He determined the source was Alcolac alone. The odors resulted in eye irritations, matting of the eyes, chest pains, severe burnings in the throat and nose, drowsiness, lack of energy, impaired memory, dizziness, and watery eyes. In years 1978 and 1979, he was employed in the installation of missile sites, and so was exposed to the emissions only on weekends. He kept horses and prize coon hounds on the property. The odors caused the horses to have runny eyes and noses and the hounds to roll, and rub their heads and nose and eyes. The hounds lost the ability to track.\n\nHe was a structural iron worker, now retired. He worked for a brief period in the demolition of two furnaces which contained asbestos.\n\nHis includes a loss of hearing, and a regimen of diabetes medication.\n\nHe no longer smokes, although he indulged that habit until he was 40 years of age, uses no alcohol, and consumes three to four cops of coffee per day.\n\nBetty Elam\n\nThe odors and fumes come only from Alcolac, and not from any of the other enterprises. She has detected odors and seen suds from Alcolac regularly since May of 1978 to the present. Her experiences with odors, fumes, smoke and haze have been in the hundreds. They include episodes of night burnings she has observed at Alcolac. Very often at night to escape the odors, and while her husband was away at work, she drove to a parking lot or went to Smithton to be with her son.\n\nThere were different odors, some were pungent, some sweet, some overwhelming. The odors caused difficulty in breathing, dizziness, blurred vision; numbness and tingling in the hands and legs, itching, nosebleeds, loss of memory, racing heartbeat, nausea, loss of energy, eye irritation, skin blisters and headaches.\n\nShe kept a diary of these occurrences, as did most of the other plaintiffs, and marked significant incidents of explosion, unusual vapor mist formations on the property from Alcolac and odors of unusual intensity. They included episodes of foam and suds \"as big as a Volkswagen\" on her property as well as on the property of others and on the public roads.\n\nHer includes a chronic anal stricture, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and low back strain. Betty Elam has smoked a pack of cigarettes a day since she was 16. She drinks pots of coffee during the day on medical advice because, she explains, her \"body lacks acid.\"\n\nShe has complained repeatedly about the emissions from Alcolac to State Senator Matthewson, to the local environmental control office, to the mayors of Sedalia, to the EPA and to the DNR. Nikkila of the DNR gave her his personal number and encouraged her to telephone if anyone reported an odor from the Alcolac site. Over the past five years, she has called him about severe odors hundreds of times.\n\nLinda Elam Sanders\n\nShe resided with the parents until 1980, when she married and moved to San Antonio, Texas. Thus, she lived near Alcolac for a year and nine months. The odors commenced after Alcolac commenced operations and occurred all the time and sometimes every other week. The odors were of rotten eggs and an overbearing lacquer scent. The emissions from Alcolac also included haze and smoke, sometimes very black, a white film on the grass and foam flying in the air.\n\nShe has seen the foam on the bioponds. Her complaints are: burning in the eyes, nose and throat, headaches, difficult breathing, coughing, bloodshot eyes, sharp pain under the ear and that her legs go to sleep. Her history includes a heart murmur diagnosed by Sedalia physician Alcorn in 1982.\n\nLinda Sanders smoked occasionally while in high school, but not thereafter. She drinks no coffee and only occasionally, alcohol.\n\nGehlken family group\n\nEdward Gehlken [age 68] and wife Malva [age 65] took occupancy of their 2 1/2 acre tract 1/2 mile north of Alcolac in July of 1978. The discomfort from the Alcolac odors and fumes prompted their move into the city of Sedalia in April 1984. Edward became incapacitated from a series of strokes. He was unable to present himself for medical examinations and did not give testimony, and his claim for personal injuries was never submitted. The court entered a directed verdict against his claim, and that judgment, unappealed, is now final.\n\nMalva Gehlken\n\nThe Alcolac operations emitted terrible odors and generated suds which came on her property. On one occasion she saw chunks of foam \"as big as five gallon buckets\" floating through the air and alighting on bushes and trees. On the occasion of the September 25, 1981 explosion at Alcolac, soot and a black flaky substance was blown onto their property. The fumes and odors caused her eyes to water and to become irritated, her nasal passages to become swollen, the throat dry and burned, brought on persistent headaches, shortness of breath, loss of hearing, cramps in the legs and right foot, charley horses in the calves as well as numbness and tingling, change in the pigmentation of the skin and blurred vision.\n\nHer fruit trees and bushes and other vegetation were affected and her garden would no longer produce, although her husband, who tended them, was an experienced farmer.\n\nHer included the anomaly of being born with three kidneys, the tingling and numbness of the wrist since age thirty, headaches in 1970 from a whiplash, and an earlier temporary loss of hearing from medication. She neither drinks alcohol nor smokes and consumes coffee only two or three times a week.\n\nShe complained to the DNR about the odors, fumes and discomfort, as well as to the local newspaper, but to no avail.\n\nLandon family group\n\nDainie Landon [age 74] and wife Mary Landon [age 71] lived on a tract immediately west and directly across the road from the entrance to Alcolac. They moved into a mobile home in May of 1984, prompted by the odors, fumes and other discomforts caused by the Alcolac operation, but retained the residence. Mary Landon had a family history of cancer. She was diagnosed as afflicted with leukemia in the early 1940's, experienced episodes of lymphoma, and in February of 1984 cancer of the colon was found and surgically excised.\n\nDainie Landon\n\nHe commenced to notice odors and fumes in the summer of 1978. Some of them smelled like oily acid. They also saw haze \"like a big black rolling cloud\" from Alcolac which came in the direction of their property, usually at night. The odors were worst when the winds were out of the north. The Landons often left the residence to escape the odors and smells.\n\nThe emissions from Alcolac caused his eyes to water and burn, the throat to burn, and brought on headaches. His nose bled, he felt sickness of the stomach, passed out, the ears stopped up, the lips and face were covered with an oily film, and large rashes and blisters formed on the exposed parts of his body. He felt shortness of breath. He kept a garden, chickens, dogs and a horse. The fruit trees never matured, the tomatoes never matured, the garden was covered with a white film, the hose foundered, and chickens died.\n\nHe returns twice a day to feed and water the animals, and the continued odors cause his symptoms to flare up.\n\nHis includes a diagnosis in 1973 of emphysema. He worked in iron construction for 34 years and used red lead, a substance which was then prohibited. He smoked a pack of cigarettes per day for 30 years until the 1973 diagnosis of emphysema and drinks no coffee or alcohol.\n\nThe Landons have complained to the DNR about the odors, and to State Senator Mathewson, but to no avail. DNR installed a monitor on the premises with instructions to activate the switch when they smelled odors, but the results were never received from Nikilla at DNR as promised.\n\nMary Landon\n\nThe odors commenced in 1978 and gave off the scent of rotten eggs and sulphur. She commenced to record the incidents of odors and emissions from Alcolac on August 8, 1979 and maintained it until May 8, 1984, when they moved into the mobile home. The odors and smoke caused sores on her body, dizziness, drowsiness, headaches, stomach upsets, chest aches, coughs with blood in the phlegm, difficult breathing and swallowing, a fast heart beat, irritated nose and blurred vision.\n\nThere were foam storms from Alcolac which came onto her property and which caused swelling and blisters when touched.\n\nHer included a congenital condition of red blood cell anomaly she had mistakenly believed to be a state of pre-leukemia, and for that reason submitted to the removal of her spleen. She was diagnosed for cancer of the bowel in February of 1984 and had surgery and was then treated by cobalt. She lacks a gall bladder, spleen, suffered from thyroid and heart conditions and obesity.\n\nShe neither smoked, nor drank alcohol, nor consumed coffee.\n\nShe often left the home with her husband to escape the odors and fumes.\n\nShe complained of the fumes and odors to State Senator Mathewson, Congressman Skelton, the office of the Sheriff and to Alcolac. Mark Blowers, then Alcolac environmental engineer, invited her to call him if needed. Mary Landon was in communication with Nikkila a number of times, but these and other complaints were of no avail.\n\nShe died in May of 1986 while appeal pended.\n\nLawrence family group\n\nJohn Lawrence [age 62] and Gwendolyn Lawrence [age 64] lived on a 24 acre tract one-half mile southwest of Alcolac. They acquired the land in 1968 and continue to own the premises. In order to escape the odors and other Alcolac emissions, they moved in with a nearby daughter and returned in 1981. They remained until November 12, 1983, when they left again for the same reasons, and now live six miles west of Sedalia. They continue to visit the home near Alcolac daily.\n\nJohn Lawrence\n\nThe commencement of the Alcolac productions caused odors, smoke, fumes and foam to drift on the Lawrence property. He described the odors as of rotten eggs, sweet and \"skunky.\" These brought on headaches, blurred vision, watery eyes, vomiting, sickness in the stomach, drowsiness, sleepiness, cramps in the arms and legs, rashes on the skin, tingling and numbness in the arms and legs, itching, matted eyes, burned throat, difficult breathing and deep coughs. These symptoms abated away from the premises but revived when he returned to the property from time to time and inhaled odors and other emissions.\n\nHis includes a condition of ulcers, since cured.\n\nHe has not smoked since 1977, drinks no alcohol, and consumes three to four cups of coffee per day. He is employed as a maintenance worker at a Sedalia school.\n\nHe complained to government officials, the DNR and also to Alcolac president Anderson and plant manager Fischer, both of whom visited the Lawrences at the home and acknowledged the \"odor problems,\" but said that they would be corrected. The odors and other emissions persisted.\n\nGwendolyn Lawrence\n\nAlthough the Lawrence residence was located near the Missouri Pacific Railroad yards and other plants, there was no odor from those sources. Odors, smoke, haze, mist and other emissions recurred over the Lawrence property day and night only after Alcolac commenced operations. These emissions were observed to come from Alcolac. The odors caused her eyes to burn, the vision to blur, hoarseness and burning in the throat, nosebleeds, rashes on the skin, leg cramps, numbness and tingling in the arms and legs; stiffness in the joints, headaches, ulcerated nose; pains in the chest, heart flutters, lethargy, itching, weakness in the legs and back leg muscles, tremors in the hand and a lack of muscular coordination. Other emissions from Alcolac manifested as greasy oil droplets on the flowers and other surfaces. There were also foam storms from the bioponds of \"big chunks\" of suds flying by the picture window and alighting on the property with foam \"as high as eight feet\" \"like balloons in the sky.\" The emissions continue.\n\nThe odors are palpable when the wind is from the north or is calm.\n\nHer includes a goiter condition, an ulcer condition in 1965, and a gallbladder surgery in 1978. In 1982 she was treated in the hospital for constipation, vomiting and a burning of the esophagus -- the latter of which she reported was caused by Alcolac.\n\nShe neither smokes nor drinks alcohol, and consumes three or four cups of coffee per day. She and others complained to State Senator Mathewson about the Alcolac odors, who gave her a credit card to call the DNR about odors. On one occasion in 1978, when her eyes \"had been burned real bad,\" she telephone Alcolac president Anderson and plant manager Fischer, who came to her home. She was asked to \"bear with them\" and that they would get the odors stopped. They persisted nevertheless.\n\nShe attended numerous environmental quality control meetings of the public, complained to Senator Eagleton, and when all else failed, commenced suit against Alcolac.\n\nMiller family group\n\nGlenn Miller [age 54] and Berniece Miller [age 54] lived on a five acre tract one-half mile north of Alcolac from 1975 until August of 1984, when the recurrence of the odors and physical discomforts they caused prompted them to move to Springfield, Missouri.\n\nGlenn Miller\n\nHe kept an organic garden on the property and used no pesticides. The garden was productive until 1978, when spots, suds and other emissions from Alcolac affected the plants. The peach trees produced nodules instead of fruit and the plum tree shriveled and died.\n\nOdors became palpable after Alcolac began operations and smelled of rotten eggs, ammonia and compressed gas. They were especially noticeable when the wind was southerly. There were explosions at Alcolac when black smoke, accompanied by odors, came over his land. The odors sapped his strength, caused the eyes to burn and water, the nose to bleed, numbness in the right leg, nausea, swollen eyes and throat soreness.\n\nHis includes varicose veins.\n\nHe complained to Nikkila at the DNR that there was a very serious odor problem. Teeter of the Division of Health consulted with him about the health effects and the blight on the crops from the Alcolac emissions, but nothing changed. He complained also to Sgt. Rice -- then an agent of the DNR -- about the odors, but they continued. He and his wife eventually moved to Springfield, Missouri to escape the effects of the emissions.\n\nBernice Miller\n\nShe never felt any discomfort from any of the business enterprises in the vicinity until Alcolac commenced operations in May of 1978. She began to smell foul odors of rotten eggs, and of hair solution used in beauty parlors for permanents. The intensity of the odors depended upon the direction of the wind and they penetrated into the residence interior. Odors as well as suds came over onto her property. The suds were blown from the Alcolac bioponds, usually about twice a month. There were explosions which dispersed soot onto the property, and smoke and haze drifted over from the Alcolac stack. When the odors became intense, she and her husband left for the home of a daughter or simply took a drive. The emissions caused her eye, throat, and nose trouble, sickening headaches, loss of energy, eye burns and infections, loss of sleep, stiff neck, numbness in the arms, tingling in the hands, impairment of hearing, irritated throat and hoarseness, stiffness and aches in the joints, shoulders and arms.\n\nHer included high blood pressure and obesity. She complained to the DNR and Nikkila and to city officials about the emissions and odors, but to no avail.\n\nPhillips family group\n\nJohn Phillips [age 58] and charlotte Phillips [age 52] purchased residence property -- an acre and-a-half -- in 1966 and continue to occupy the premises. The tract lies one-half mile directly north of Alcolac, separated only by a track of railroad.\n\nJohn Phillips\n\nLife on the acreage was pleasant until Alcolac commenced operations in 1978. There were never any odors from the Missouri Pacific Railroad yards or any other plants in the vicinity until Alcolac started production. He could not describe the odors, but they are persistent and continue to the present time. They are most noticeable when the wind is from the south or is calm. In addition to odors, a black substance settles on cars and other surfaces, especially after explosions in the monomer plant. Suds and foam from Alcolac alight everywhere and on his property and into the waterway which feeds Shaver Creek. A white substance covers the vegetation and an oily substance covers the garden plants.\n\nThe wild life is no longer worth eating. The garden, once productive, and the domestic animals, once edible, have been so affected by the emissions that he has cut down the one and butchered the other.\n\nThe odors and emissions have brought on blurred vision, nausea, dizziness, eyes which burn and water, vomiting, numbness and loss of grip in both hands, numbness and tingling in the feet to the knees, numbness and tingling in the right arm, pains in the chest, sore throat, loss of appetite, depression and loss of libido, headaches, pain in the left eye, shortness of breath, loss of hearing and fatigue.\n\nHe is a retired construction worker. He smoked cigarettes for forty years until 1981, and now occasionally smokes a pipe. He drinks no alcohol, but consumes six to seven cups of coffee per day.\n\nHis prior medical history includes an appendicitis in 1947; an inner ear infection in about 1977; gastritis in 1952 and breathing problems -- diagnosed as bronchial obstructive disease in 1981.\n\nHe complained to president Anderson at Alcolac about the odors and emissions and to then plant manager Aid, but to no avail. Teeter, with the Missouri Division of Health, advised him to cut down his garden, and Phillips complied.\n\nCharlotte Phillips\n\nShe was subjected to neither odors, suds nor other emission from any sources before Alcolac commenced operation in 1978. The odors were of rotten eggs, varnish, \"real sickening and sweet\" -- also, of dead fish and sulphur. Foam and suds came onto her property and near her property \"really a lot of times.\" A black substance or specks fell over the surfaces, most noticeably after the explosion of September 25, 1981. There were also incursions of black smoke from Alcolac. A white substance covered the grass, trees and flowers. These emissions and substances were never present before the Alcolac operations.\n\nShe complained of burning and bloodshot eyes, dizziness, nausea, hoarseness, earaches, headaches, fatigue, vomiting, hearing loss, skin rashes and growths, cramps in the calves and legs, sore and burning throat, urinary tract infection and loss of libido.\n\nA horse they kept lost skin off the nose from eating the grass. They cut down their garden on the advise of the Missouri Department of Health and no longer have that source, nor the domestic animals, as a source for food.\n\nShe weighs 200 pounds. She is employed as a forklift operator. She does not smoke nor consume alcohol. She drinks two cups of coffee per week.\n\nHer includes a gallstone surgery, a kidney infection, borderline diabetes and a constipation problem related to the colon.\n\nShe complained of the odors and emissions to the Mayor and councilmen of Sedalia, to State Senator Mathewson, to Congressman Skelton, Senator Eagleton and to the municipal police and fire departments. They were to no avail. She complained to Alcolac as well, and president Anderson responded by a visit to the house and said he would \"try to fix\" the odors. The respective plant managers, Fischer and aid, came a number of times, and both apologized and promised to try a correction, but that never came about. On one early occasion Dr. Boies from WAPORA responded to a complaint of odors and conducted her around the plant to determine the source -- it was from a leak in the monomer building.\n\nPryor family group\n\nDaniel Pryor [age 35] and Joyce Pryor [age 33] lived on a premises a mile and-a-half east of Alcolac from October of 1978 to February of 1984, when the marriage was dissolved and they separated. Amber Cross [age 11], a child of Joyce Pryor by a former marriage, was a member of their household. Thus, Amber shared the premises between her fourth and ninth birthdays.\n\nDaniel Pryor\n\nHe described the odors generated by Alcolac as that of ammonia and cat urine. There were many occasions of suds that could be seen \"all across the road where they were stacked up pretty high.\" At night as he drove by Alcolac, the atmosphere was almost hazy. He developed symptoms never present before Alcolac: dizziness, severe headaches, nausea, fatigue, stomach cramps, dryness of the throat and mouth, stinging, red and running eyes, loss of memory, stiffness in the legs, calves, arm sleeps and tingle and shortness of breath. He works as a carpenter and now smokes half-a-pack of cigarettes per day, drinks three cups of decaffeinated coffee per day and consumes a twelve pack of beer over the weekend and two drinks of hard liquor per day. He smoked marijuana briefly after the Vietnamese war and experimented with LSD once. He had consumed no alcohol for nine years before 1984, but resumed following the marital discord.\n\nHis includes an ear infection and skin rashes during service in Vietnam.\n\nJoyce Pryor\n\nThe odors from Alcolac were apparent to her both at home and enroute and return from work by the plant. The suds and foam did not drive as far as their residence, but were to be found on the road nearby, at least once, to a depth of the car bumper. The odors were \"real pungent,\" like ammonia and rotten boiled eggs. She began to experience physical complaints after October of 1978: nausea, diarrhea, rashes, eyes burning, inflamed with a \"swollen and ached feeling,\" dryness of the mouth and throat, a \"chemical breath,\" numbness and tingling in the arm and leg, headaches, impaired hearing, a disrupted menstrual cycle, vomiting, chest pains, disorientation and a rapid pulse. Her personal habits have been spasmodic. She commenced to smoke at age 19, then discontinued from 1975 to 1980 and now uses less than a pack a day. She experimented with heroin and marijuana during her first marriage [to Cross], and was depressed during her marital discord with Pryor. She drinks tea and two liquors a day. Her employment at Missouri Pressed Metals in Sedalia [from October 1978 to June 1979] involved powdered graphite, copper and other metals.\n\nHer includes a nervous breakdown in 1973, and swelling to her hands and face and rashes from the work duty at Missouri Pressed Metals Company. The occupational symptoms subsided after she left that employment, but the physical conditions induced by the Alcolac emissions persist.\n\nAmber Cross\n\nShe recalls the foam and suds on one occasion and describes the odors as of burnt tires. She was exposed to the odors when she rode her bicycle on Griessen Road -- where her home was located and which bounded Alcolac on the north. She observed foam on the creeks and odors emanated from them as well. When she played in the yard, her nose burned constantly, her head became feverish, and she coughed up phlegm. When she played near the creek, she got headaches, dizziness, and a sense that she was about to faint. She experienced \"real bad\" sore throats and coughed up food and blood. Her eyes watered and became red and burned; she itched and rashes appeared on her chest, legs and back. On the occasion of a visit to her stepmother Cross, she gave the child marijuana to smoke and beer and wine to sip.\n\nHer includes a kidney infection, which the physician diagnosed as the consumption of \"too much pop.\"\n\nSommers family group\n\nArnold Sommers [age 43] and Joyce Sommers [age 38] live with their daughter Joy [age 15] and his daughter Tammy [age 19] on a 13 acre tract purchased in 1973 and located about 3/4 of a mile southwest of Alcolac. Missouri Pressed Metals is located about 200 feet from the home, and the Missouri Pacific Railroad yard and other plants are close by, but none has been the source of any troublesome odor or emission. It was not until after Alcolac commenced operations that odors and other emollient became palpable and induced physical complaints.\n\nArnold Sommers\n\nHe described two odor-types as most frequent: that of sulphur and of sweet perfume. There are also emissions of ash or smoke he observes drift down from Alcolac and settle on the garden and vegetation. Suds came over onto the property \"like a blizzard.\" A mist or smoke from Alcolac, so dense as to obscure sight, envelops the pasture. These emissions cause headaches, nosebleeds, numbness in the hands and foot, cramps, charley horses and occasional tingling, nausea, eyes to water and to become matted shut, the throat to burn, sinus trouble, impediment in speech, soreness of the neck and rapid heart beat. The effect of exposure to these conditions caused him to rage so that he struck his horse in the nose with such force so as to break his hand.\n\nThe owned acreage was also used to grow food and to raise livestock. The garden no longer produces. Twelve of the thirty pigs died since the onset of Alcolac operations, as well as nine calves and two cows. They have been afflicted with a condition of red, watery eyes and the cattle as well as a showhorse are afflicted with an irritation which causes them to abrade their hides.\n\nHe drives a truck for employment, drinks about two beers a day, and has smoked a pack-and-a-half of cigarettes a day since age seventeen. His past history includes an ulcer condition, a fractured right leg and wrist from a motorcycle accident, a broken nose from another vehicular accident, and metal has twice penetrated his eye. There have been no permanent consequences from those conditions and misadventures.\n\nJoyce Sommers\n\nShe was free of significant physical problems before the advent of Alcolac in May of 1978. Then the incidence of smoke, fumes and odors began. There were also numerous explosions at the Alcolac plant, as well as drifts of foam on their property from that source. The odors were predominantly of sulphur. The exposures from Alcolac caused her nosebleeds, headaches, sinus drain, sore throat, dizziness, loss of stamina, leg cramps with tingling and numbness, recurrence of an irregular menstrual cycle, earaches and irritated skin. The emissions affected the garden and domestic animals also. The growth of the fruits and vegetables was stunted, and the horse and cattle developed sores from constant rubbing.\n\nThe last explosion at Alcolac occurred only a few days before her trial testimony -- on September 6, 1985 -- and was marked by a strong sulphur odor.\n\nShe is presently employed by the Sedalia Democrat, the local newspaper and, earlier, worked at the Missouri Pressed Metals, without medical consequences. She missed work in May of 1983 for dizziness caused by a condition of the inner ear.\n\nShe neither smokes, nor drinks alcoholic beverages, and consumes coffee only occasionally. Her includes an infection of the urinary tract at age 18 and a broken jaw, dislocated hip and tracheotomy from an automobile accident in 1971.\n\nTammy Sommers\n\nShe left the family residence in Sedalia in January of 1983, more than four years after Alcolac commenced operations. The quality of air up to them was normal, but thereafter, \"horrible odors, smoke, foam and soap bubbles\" were carried onto the property by the wind. The odors and emissions caused coughing practically daily. The odors and fumes would interrupt her sleep with headaches. She has developed tingling and numbness in the hand and a loss of grip. She has nosebleeds and congestion in the head and nose and recently she has developed pain in the colon.\n\nShe is now a mother. She smokes a pack of cigarettes per day and drinks two cups of coffee a day. Her includes a cut left arm and right hand from an encounter with a plate glass door, and a stitched elbow from a like, later encouter. In 1984 she fractured an ankle and leg in an automobile accident.\n\nJoy Sommers\n\nShe was eight years of age when Alcolac commenced production. That is when the odors, fumes, smoke and suds commenced. Her newspaper delivery course took her around the Alcolac plant and the odors from the plant and the foam from the ponds were palpable. The foam often came onto the family property, as did the smoke, and white specks fell on the vegetation. She described the odors as \"like burning plastic, sulphur, dead fish, super glue, alcohol perfume.\" The pond in the pasture, a swimming hole, was covered with a film of oil. The emissions after the onset of the Alcolac operations brought on nosebleeds, headaches, nose congestion, sore throat, earaches, sinus activity and blisters on the body. There were no smoke or odors from the Missouri Pacific Railroad yards nearby or from Missouri Pressed Metals or from the other plants. There is an occasional odor of lacquer from a fiberglass plant nearby, but nothing else.\n\nShe has no significant prior history.\n\nThe odors persist and were experienced, most recently, the night before she testified at the trial. They continue to awaken her frequently and cause a congestion which makes breathing difficult.\n\nTurley family group\n\nJames Turley [age 42] and Kay Turley [age 44] moved onto a 60 acre tract located somewhat more than a mile due west of Alcolac and lived there with the three children, William Lance Turley [age 22], Lisa Turley [age 21] and Lyle Turley [age 9]. Lyle is the child of the marriage and William and Lisa are children of Kay Turley through a former marriage, and adopted by James Turley. The acreage was purchased as a place of retirement upon the Conclusion of military service by James Turley, then a lieutenant colonel. The persistent course of emissions from Alcolac and the physical consequences to the members of the family prompted them to move to Abilene, Texas at the end of May of 1981. They sold the residence and a three acre tract on which it rested and still retain 57 acres.\n\nJames Turley\n\nHis sense of smell was impaired by a series of breaks to his nose, consequently he was unable to detect or describe any odors except those from close by sources -- as from dairy farm operations. He did observe soap foam blow across his land -- especially when the wind was from the east -- and his personal investigation disclosed that Alcolac was the source. In August of 1978, he commenced to have difficulty in breathing through the nose, and the irritation of burning and constant drainage through the nose became constant. He became lethargic, lacked endurance, his knee became tender to the touch, rashes developed on the skin, as well as tremors from fatigue. His hearing and memory became impaired, as was his libido. A prostate infection developed as well as a continual burning and watering of the eyes.\n\nHe neither smokes nor drinks and consumes three to four cups of coffee per day.\n\nHis includes a restriction in breathing caused by a series of nose fractures incurred during football scrimmages in his youth which impaired his sense of smell; a spastic colon and the incidence and removal of a polyp in that organ.\n\nKay Turley\n\nThe onset of Alcolac operations brought on numerous physical complaints which included fatigue, congestion of the nose, watering, itching and redness of the eyes, lethargy, pressure in the right ear and depression. She does not smoke or consume alcoholic beverages and drinks two cups of coffee or tea daily.\n\nHer past history includes a condition of anemia which she treats by normal supplements; an episode of mitral valve prolapse which remains uneventful unless expose to infection.\n\nWilliam Lance Turley\n\nHe was 15 years of age when Alcolac commenced production in May of 1978. He -- in contrast to his father who repeatedly suffered breaks to his nose -- has a keen sense of smell. The odors from Alcolac were sweet. He complains of tiredness, lethargy and the inability to concentrate, conditions which have impaired his school work. His nose runs and he has colds which persist. The eyes burn, swell and water and his nose bleeds persistently. His throat is sore, the chest rattles with phlegm, he coughs up blood and mucus, and he experiences numbness and tingling from the elbows to the fingertips and from the knees to the feet. He neither smokes nor drinks coffee, but since his marriage he drinks alcoholic beverages occasionally. His includes a medical opinion in 1971 that he becomes infected easily, and has experienced skin rashes before the advent of Alcolac. He also had frequent ear infections when younger.\n\nLisa Turley\n\nShe recalled experiences of odors -- she was then 12 years of age -- and described them as rotten odors, but could not then say whether they were related to the Alcolac activity. She complains of pain in the knee joints, feet, arms and hips and aches so severe as to incapacitate her. She is lethargic, lacks energy and falls asleep uncontrollably. She suffers from headaches, congestion, cough and watery eyes.\n\nShe does not smoke, drinks alcohol about three times a week and drinks coffee occasionally. Her includes broken arms from a fall from a tree in 1979, and shoulder problems related to her swimming activity.\n\nLyle Turley\n\nHe was five years of age when the family moved from Sedalia to Abilene. He recalls that he coughed a great deal, and that his throat was sore and congested. His mother described his symptoms as that of a \"very sick boy\"; he coughed all night long as though he was trying to dislodge something from his throat, and squinted his eyes a great deal. The father described his symptoms as a persistent hacking cough and a runny nose. These symptoms as well as the squinting of the eyes have been relieved by the move away from the Sedalia property.\n\nWithers family group\n\nRalph Withers [age 54] and Genevieve Withers [age 54] live on an 8 and 1/2 acre tract just 1/2 mile north and across the tracks from Alcolac. There were no discernible odors from 1959, when they assumed occupancy of the premises, until May of 1978, when Alcolac commenced production.\n\nRalph Withers\n\nThe odors engendered by the Alcolac explosions, smoke and other emissions were those of ammonia, burnt styrofoam and old rotten cabbage. There was an explosion at Alcolac in September of 1981 when the odors were particularly intense and noxious. There were suds and foam from the bioponds in \"gobs as big as a five-gallon bucket\" which alighted on their property. Smoke was generated at Alcolac at night and came onto the property. He complained of headaches, stiffness of the shoulders and neck, a throat sore and scratchy, skin rash and a sinus condition aggravated.\n\nHe discontinued his pack-a-day cigarette habit in 1967, drinks three to four cups of coffee per day, and imbibes an occasional alcoholic drink.\n\nHis includes the removal of a polyp from his throat in 1967, a sinus difficulty, and complaints of chest pain in 1977. To county official Hieronymous and to Teeter of the Missouri Division of Health he complained about the odors which he described as odors of paint or lacquer. The complaints did not avail.\n\nGenevieve Withers\n\nShe described a white substance residue and black specks on the grapes and other herbiage. Suds and foam have come on the property \"like a snowstorm\" from Alcolac, and explosions have vented black soot, over the garage, patio and car. The last explosions and chemical fire at Alcolac occurred just a few days before her testimony at the trial. Foul odors and smoke also are recurrent incidents of that operation. The odors are of ammonia, rotten eggs, lacquer and rotten cabbage. They cause headaches, aggravate the sinus, cause a sore throat, a reduced stamina, watering and itching of the eyes, charley horses and stiffness in the legs, numbness and tingling in the legs and bladder infections, loss of concentration and memory and diminished hearing. She neither smokes, nor consumes alcohol, and drinks one cup of coffee per day.\n\nHer includes a condition of diabetes, and a condition of high blood pressure.\n\nShe complained of the odors and emissions to county official Hieronymous and to Nikkila at the DNR, but to no effect.\n\nAPPENDIX F\n\nTo: C. N. Anderson\n\nFrom: P. Bouroff\n\nMay 27, 1980\n\nPROGRESS AS OF MAY 1980\n\nItem 1: 2MIM: One of the \"incineratables\", methanol 70%, MMA 30% azeotrope once accumulated to a T/W quantity is shipped to Rohm \u0026 Haas at no cost to us but freight. This is so far the cheapest disposal proposition.\n\nItems 1 \u0026 2: Our liquid incinerator has the poorest performance ever seen. Most of the time it is out of commission due to all kinds of mechanical problems. It is an absolute waste of time and money. We consider it a 100% failure and the most costly operation. Also, part of our environmental problems were/are caused by this piece of equipment. We suggest buying/installing a new unit, capacity at least double of the present \"theoretical\" 50 gph.\n\nOn June 1'0-11, 1980, Mr. Larry Doucet, P.E., a world expert in incineration will be visiting Sedalia. He will lecture, evaluate our incinerator (it does not have to be and recommend the right one. Until then, no action will be taken except to try to operate what we have.\n\nItems 3 \u0026 6: At a cost of 33/c/gallon, dispose of as many drums of wastes as possible by transferring same into hauler's T/W's. This to comply with the DNR request and improve the appearance of our plant. Problem: we have a hard time finding a cooperage firm to pick up the used drums. We are working on it, also H. Caldwell, who was asked to investigate.\n\nAs of mid May 1980, we have shipped seven loads of wastes and emptied over 1,000 drums.\n\nItem 3:\n\na. AGE brine treatment to remove tin: So far about 10 x 3,000 gallon batches in R-600 have been processed as reported by W. Sutton. It is not known how many batches will be required in the 6,000 gallon \"tin\" tank to treat the contents of two lagoons containing this brine.\n\nAttention W. Sutton: Would you please estimate the number of batches and time needed in the 6,000 gallon tank/reactor.\n\nPresently the 'freshly\" made AGE brine is treated to partially precipitate tin while steam stripped AA in R-600. This saves time and energy, combining two operations into one. Unfortunately, the brine stored in the lagoons will have to be reheated in the 6,000 gallon reactor.\n\nAPPENDIX G\n\nMEMORANDUM\n\nTo: All Employees\n\nFrom: William Sutton\n\nSubject: Odor and Pollution Control\n\nDate: May 22, 1980\n\nDuring the past three months we have been cited three times by the Air Pollution Enforcement Division of the Department of Natural Resources for excessive odor emissions. These citations are serious and will probably result in further action from the DNR. In addition there have been numerous complaints and unfavorable publicity by the local news media.\n\nIn depth review of the causes of the citations and complaints reveal that human error in one way or another was involved: Most of these errors were operational and could have been prevented had proper procedures been followed or additional thought given to actions before proceeding. It is not necessary to go into details because I am sure each of you know the incidents that were involved and why they happened.\n\nWe are presently in a position that further operating errors or other causes of odors will be very serious. They could result in additional citations and ultimately the shut down of the plant. This of course means our jobs are possibly on the line and points out the real concern that should be applied to the control of odors and wastes.\n\nIn practice the control of emissions to the environment is everybody's responsibility and should not be left to the other person. Everyone should be concerned about this problem and are expected to show sound judgment in their actions. Continued errors that cause environmental problems will have to result in disciplinary action to the offenders.\n\nAPPENDIX H\n\nI am sure everyone would like to see their part in controlling this difficult problem. Should anyone note a problem with odors or any type of emission, please try to correct the situation or at least bring to the immediate attention of the person in charge of the area for their action. We are open to suggestions from anyone who has ideas that would improve our environmental program.\n\nYour cooperation in handling this serious situation will be greatly appreciated\n\n/s/ Bill Sutton\n\nAPPENDIX-I\n\nSHELL OIL COMPANY\n\nSHELL CHEMICAL COMPANY\n\nSHELL DEVELOPMENT COMPANY\n\nSHELL PIPE LINE CORPORATION\n\nMSDS 5080-6\n\nMATERIAL SAFETY DATA SHEET\n\n[]\n\nAPPENDIX J\n\nSECTION V HEALTH HAZARD DATA\n\n[]\n\nAPPENDIX K\n\nCarl Berry\n\nHe noted that some of his laboratory tests were \"slightly outside the normal range\" but could not say \"what that means clinically at this point in time.\" He noted also the Midwest--Wheeler result of 19.7 for the HNK test with a reference range of 3.8 to 9.6, and deemed it \"of some interest.\" He acknowledged that the \"clinical significance of that at the moment is really not clear,\" but concluded nevertheless: \"e doesn't seem to have a clinical immune disease.\"\n\nEthel Berry\n\nHe acknowledged that \"he has some tests that again fall outside the normal range,\" but did not know \"what the significance of those are.\" He concluded that she had no functional abnormality in her immune system.\n\nJacquelyn Berry\n\nHe noted \"a few cell populations that are again outside the normal.\" He did not think that to be \"clinically significant,\" and found no functional abnormality in her immune system.\n\nDorothy Bradley\n\nHe found an abnormal helper subpopulation [T/4] to a suppressor subpopulation [T/8] ratio - a ratio of 4.03 against a reference range of 1.10 to 2.55. He commented: \"he clinical significance of that is highly speculative.\" He found no functional abnormality as to her immune system. Dorothy Bradley was a plaintiff excluded from the KU protocol, hence the evaluation rests exclusively upon the other tests and medical sources.\n\nVirgil Bradley\n\nHe noted \"some subtle changes in the lymphocyte numbers.\" The test results marked a T/4 to T/8 cell ratio outside the reference range. He found no functional abnormality in Virgil's immune system.\n\nAmber Cross\n\nShe was among the plaintiffs excluded from the KU tests protocol. The other laboratory tests indicated an abnormal T/4 to T/8 cell population - a value of .95 with a reference range of 1.10 to 2.55. That plaintiff was then eleven years of age, but that abnormality gave the evaluator no concern. The evaluator gave opinion that there was no functional abnormality in the immune system of Amber Cross. He acknowledged that he did not regularly threat children with immunologic diseases.\n\nBetty Elam\n\nHe found nothing of clinical significance from the records before, and found no functional abnormality in her immune system.\n\nClarence Elam\n\nHe noted a value for HNK [Human Natural Killer cells] of 12.5, outside the reference range, 3.8 to 9.6, but found it of no significance. He found no functional abnormality in Clarence's immune system.\n\nMalva Gehlken\n\nShe was among the plaintiffs excluded from the KU tests protocol. The evaluator found a value below the reference range in the T/4 to T/8 cell ratio. That gave him no cause for concern \"in terms of her functional response,\" and he determined there was no functional abnormality in her immune system.\n\nDainie Landon\n\nThe evaluator found \"some abnormal numbers,\" a T/4 to T/8 cell ratio \"slightly above the reference range\" - a 2.78 value beyond the outside reference range of 2.55. That was no cause for concern - and presumably his immune system was intact in terms of function.\n\nMary Landon\n\nThe evaluator found that her laboratory tests were \"clearly abnormal,\" \"far and away different than what you would expect for an individual her age, sex, etc.\" He explained that radiation is known to be \"particularly toxic or detrimental to the immune system,\" but could point to no \"direct evidence that radiation treatment has caused the abnormality in her immune system.\" He concluded, nevertheless, that the abnormalities in her immune system disclosed by the tests were \"most likely\" the result of the radiation therapy.\n\nGwendolyn Lawrence\n\nHe found nothing on which to comment in her various tests and concluded that she displayed no functional abnormality in her immune system.\n\nJohn Lawrence\n\nHe found an HNK value of 20 with a reference range of 3.8 to 9.6, but determined that although it was \"of interest\" as \"outside what is usually found in people,\" that finding was of no \"clinical relevance.\" He found no functional abnormality in John's immune system.\n\nBernice Miller\n\nHe found an HNK value of 15 with a reference range of 3.8 to 9.6, but determined it was not significant, and concluded there was no functional abnormality in her immune system.\n\nGlen Miller\n\nHe found some tests outside the normal range in the lymphocyte subpopulations, but found no abnormality in the function of Glen's immune system.\n\nCharlotte Phillips\n\nHe found nothing in the records to indicate \"a significant immune dysfunction or irregularity,\" and found no functional abnormality in her immune system.\n\nJohn Phillips\n\nHe was among the plaintiffs excluded from the KU tests protocol. The evaluator found nothing in the records to indicate a significant immune dysfunction or irregularity. He found no functional abnormality in John's immune system.\n\nDaniel Pryor\n\nHe was among the plaintiffs excluded from the KU tests protocol. The evaluator found from the records some laboratory tests outside the normal range, but found no functional abnormality in Daniel's immune system.\n\nJoyce Pryor\n\nShe was among those plaintiffs excluded from the KU tests protocol. He found nothing significant in the records of the other laboratory tests and found no functional abnormality in her immune system.\n\nLinda Elam Sanders\n\nShe was among those plaintiffs excluded from the KU tests protocol. The records of the other tests disclosed a slightly depressed immoglobulin level, a matter he deemed without clinical significance. He found no functional abnormality in her immune system.\n\nArnold Sommers\n\nHe was among those plaintiffs excluded from the KU tests protocol. His records disclosed the HNK subpopulation of lymphocytes \"slightly outside the normal range.\" The evaluator did not know the significance of that finding. He determined there was no functional abnormality in Arnold's immune system.\n\nJoy Sommers\n\nHe found nothing of significance in her test results, and determined that there was no functional abnormality in her immune system.\n\nTammy Sommers\n\nHe found some of her lymphocyte subpopulations to be outside the normal range, but did not know the significance of that finding. He determined there was no functional abnormality in her immune system.\n\nJames Turley\n\nHe found no significant immune dysfunction or irregularity from the test records and concluded that James had no functional abnormality in his immune system.\n\nKay Turley\n\nShe was among those plaintiffs excluded from the KU tests protocol. Her records disclosed a history of seasonal rhinitis - an inflammation of the nose - in this case, an allergic reaction. He found no functional abnormality in her immune system.\n\nLyle Turley\n\nHe was among the plaintiffs excluded from the KU tests protocol. He also had a history of seasonal, allergic rhinitis. The evaluation found no functional abnormality in his immune system.\n\nLance Turley\n\nHe found no significant immune dysfunction or irregularity from the records and concluded Lance had no functional abnormality in his immune system.\n\nGenevieve Withers\n\nHe noted an HNK test result value of 3.3 with a reference range of 3.8 to 9.6, but found, nevertheless, no functional abnormality in her immune system.\n\nRalph Withers\n\nHe found no immune dysfunction or irregularity from the test records. The evaluator determined that there was no functional abnormality in Ralph's immune system.\n\nAPPENDIX L-1\n\nDOROTHY BRADLEY\n\nAGE 74\n\nLIFE EXPECTANCY

He pursues academic medicine which involves teaching through the subspecialty level as a clinician who treats patients as an instructional device. He also treats patients privately. He has participated in epidemiological projects on tuberculosis and studied the interrelationship of immunology and pulmonary disease with Dr. Stechschulte, immunologist witness for Alcolac.\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003e51 Dr. Emmett serves as Director of the Division of Occupational Medicine of the School of Hygiene and Public Health at Johns Hopkins. He is board certified in toxicology in the United States and board certified in occupational medicine in Australia. Environmental medicine, he explained, is a counterpart of occupational medicine and is now subsumed within that specialty. He sees patients regularly for occupational exposures and illnesses and specializes in occupational dermatology. Among his extensive professional credits, is affiliation by the Division of Occupational Medicine with the World Health Organization -- the branch of the United Nations which deals with the subject of health -- and participation in the working groups of the International Agency for Research on Cancer , which deals with substances suspected as carcinogens. The working groups determine from the evidence whether the suspect substance is a cancer agent in humans or animals. The findings are then distributed for comment to peer members of IARC throughout the world. Among his many other credits are roles in numerous epidemiological studies.\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003e52 See Appendix Q-1, Q-2, Q-3, typical diagnosis charts as composed by Dr. Emmett and explained in this testimony.\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003e53 The testimony of Dr. Kerby can be understood to attribute to Alcolac not only the complaints of eye, nose, throat and skin irritations given in the histories of the plaintiffs, but also [in the cases of Betty Elam, Gwendolyn Lawrence and John Phillips] the complaints and conditions of peripheral neuropathy.\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003e54 For instance, Dr. Kerby attributed the hearing loss the audiometric tests detected in Carl Berry as caused by his duty during the Korean War on an aircraft carrier and his later occupation as the operator of heavy equipment. That attribution of etiology assumed exposure to jet aircraft and lack of protective headgear in the naval occupation and noisy equipment in the civilian occupation. Carl Berry testified in rebuttal, however, that the aircraft were propeller driven, that he wore protective headgear, that he was tested monthly for consequences of his duty on his hearing, and that his hearing on final examination prior to discharge tested normal. His civilian occupation thereafter, he also testified, involved no unduly noisy equipment.\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003e55 As we noted, a directed verdict was entered against plaintiff Edward Gehlken at the close of the case for the plaintiffs. He had been incapacitated for reasons other than any misconduct by Alcolac, was not able to appear for the numerous examinations, and so failed to prove that he suffered any bodily injury by Alcolac. His nuisance claim for damage to the property he owned with Malva Gehlken remained intact.\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003e56 see decisions listed in the Missouri Digest 2d Negligence § 56[1.2) Test for causal relation.\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003e57 The exposures to the Alcolac emissions to which the plaintiffs attribute their bodily diseases spanned the period from commencement of plant operations in May of 1978 to the commencement of trial in August of 1985 - an interval of seven years. Only eight of the plaintiffs were subjected to exposure for the entire period. The duration of exposure varied as to the other twenty-four plaintiffs. Carl and Jacqueline Berry took up residence in the environs of Alcolac in 1979, so the maximum period of their exposure was six years. Virgil and Dorothy Bradley moved into Sedalia proper in 1984 when the odors and emissions did not abate - [a six-year exposure]. Clarence Elam was employed away from home during the week from 1978 to 1979, and returned home only on weekends - [an enhanced six-year exposure]. Linda Elam Sanders married in 1980 and removed to Texas - [a one-year, nine-month exposure]. John and Gwendolyn Lawrence were prompted by the odors and emissions to leave the premises in November of 1983 for residence of the far side of Sedalia, and lived intermittently with a nearby daughter - [a diminished five-year exposure]. Dainie and Mary Landon left the residence in May of 1984 to escape the emissions and moved into a mobile home - [a six-year exposure]. Glenn and Bernice Miller removed to Springfield in August of 1984 to escape the odors - [an enhanced six-year exposure]. Daniel and Joyce Pryor, with her daughter Amber, left the residence in February of 1984 after the dissolution of the marriage - [an enhanced six-year exposure]. Tammy Sommers left the family residence in January of 1983 - [an enhanced four-year exposure]. The Turley family - James, Kay, Lance, Lisa and Lyle - were prompted by the Alcolac odors to remove to Texas in May of 1981 - [a three-year exposure].\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003e58 In fact, as early as 1978, a number of the plaintiffs commenced and kept calendars of the incidence of odors, haze, foam and other emissions from Alcolac - as well as of the episodes of burnings on the Alcolac premises. The entries were not uniform. Some describe the odors. Some note the duration of the odors and emissions. All record the dates of those events. The entries are intermittent - and presumably coincided with the dispersion of the pollution by the variable winds in that locale. The diary of Dainie and Mary Landon commenced in 1978 and records the incidence of odors as early as June 13th of that year. The Landons also kept a diary of the physical symptoms and manifestations the diarists attributed to the exposures, as well as the medical treatment received for those conditions. The plaintiff chroniclers include Ethel Berry, Carl and Jacqueline Berry, the Bradleys, the Elams, the Landons, the Lawrences, the Phillips, the Sommers and the Withers.\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003eThe incidence of these odors, emissions and residues from Alcolac recorded in the calendars was on the average of fifteen days per month. The Berry, Bradley, Elam and Landon residences are sited on three sides of Alcolac - where all of the plaintiffs were located, except for the Pryor family. Virtually all of the fifty nonplaintiff residents in the environs, who also testified concerning the Alcolac emissions, are sited on similar - but more extended - radii from the plant. [See Appendix B] Those plaintiffs who did not keep calendars, as well as the fifty non-plaintiff residents in the environs, testified to the same odors, the same emissions, frequency, and to the same physical effects. Some of these nonplaintiffs lived more than three miles from the Alcolac plant.\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003e59 Actually, not too long after the emissions became bothersome, DNR installed a \"personnel sampler\" furnished by the EPA in an appurtenant building on the Landon premises. A logbook was left with instructions that the Landons go to that structure and turn on the pump whenever they smelled odors and record the time as well as the time the odors ceased. The pump was then to be turned off and the time also recorded. EPA required the return of the sampler after a month, and the pump had never been turned on.\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003e60 Three of the plaintiffs were employed at Missouri Pressed Metals company during some of the period they claim harmful exposure to the Alcolac chemicals. Linda Sanders operated a machine there for three months in 1980. Joyce Pryor operated a machine for seven months until June, 1979. Joyce Sommers worked machines for two and one-half years. None of them worked with the trichloroethane solvent or were exposed to its vapors. None complained of or experienced irritation or ailment from that labor. In any event, the proviso which conditioned the acceptance as medical fact by examiners Emmett and Kerby of the histories given by the plaintiffs that irritations followed exposure to Alcolac emissions was that no alternative point source of toxic pollution could reasonably account for those acute bodily manifestations.\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003e61 The evidence identified eleven toxic chemicals [among the uncounted others] used and generated in the Alcolac monomer process as of the toxicological properties which cause the kind of biological disease claimed by the plaintiffs: epichlorohydrin, allyl alcohol, ethyl acrylate, toluene, glydicyl ether, cyclohexane, dimethyl sulfate, hydrogen sulfide, methylene chloride, hypochloric acid, and allyl methacrylate. Alcolac argues recurrently that, the toxicological properties of these chemicals notwithstanding, the acknowledgments of toxicologists Legator and Carnow that mere odors do not signify the presence of chemicals means that there was no proof that any of them ever impinged upon the bodily system of any plaintiff, and hence this evidence proves nothing.\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003eThere was evidence by witnesses, many of them employees of Alcolac, that many of these chemicals gave off distinctive odors and that those odors were palpable when used or formed in the production process. Warren Fischer, Alcolac plant supervisor, testified that the hydrogen sulfide generated in the bioponds gave off the odor of rotten eggs. That was the testimony of Alcolac witness Nikkila of the DNR, as well as of Dr. Reid of WAPORA. Fischer, and others, described the odor of ethyl acrylate during the production process as that of paint thinner or varnish - another description frequently attributed to the Alcolac odors by both plaintiffs and nonplaintiffs alike. Toluene gave off a sweet odor - also frequently attributed to the emissions during Alcolac production. The acute effect of many of these compounds - allyl methacrylate, allyl alcohol and dimethyl sulfate, among them - was irritating to the eyes, skin, mucous membrane and upper respiratory system. These were effects described by almost all those who were exposed to the odors during Alcolac production - plaintiffs and nonplaintiffs alike. Two of the most dangerous of the chemicals, epichlorohydrin and dimethyl sulfate, have no odor at all.\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003eThere was agreement among the experts that all of these chemicals entered into the bodily system by inhalations, as well as by other disparate portals. Alcolac expert Schwartz explained: \"When you inhale something you're taking it directly into the circulation.\" Thus, while there was no direct proof as to which of the Alcolac chemical contaminants any of the plaintiffs ingested at any time [nor could there be in the absence of the records of identification and measurements expected of Alcolac], the coincidence of these odors and the acute manifestations with the emissions from the Alcolac source - and the absence of these odors and manifestations when that source was not active - bears as circumstantial proof that both the presence and concomitant inhalation of those odors were related to the biological disease these chemicals cause, and the plaintiffs claim.\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003e62 It is a rule of our law of evidence, a recognition of necessity, that an expert may corroborate the opinion rendered by reference to standard publications or reported scientific data not otherwise part of the evidence. State v. Greenhaw, 553 S.W.2d 318, 326[11] (Mo. App. 1977); MoBar CLE, Evidence Restated § 703. This rule applies most aptly in mass toxic tort cases where, as here, the determination of the essential cause in fact element of the causes of action depends virtually altogether on scientific testimony. See Federal Rule of Evidence 703; M. Dore, Law of Toxic Torts § 27 (1988).\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003e63 The demonstration of a biologically plausible relationship between a chemical toxin and disease is an assessment of risk. The usual methods to measure risk from exposure to chemicals are the epidemiologic studies, animal bio-assays and short-term assays [in vitro tests for mutagenic, and hence carcinogenic and other genotoxic, activity of chemicals.] T. Brennan and R. Carter, Legal and Scientific Probability of Causation of Cancer and Other Environmental Disease in Individuals, 10 Journal of Health Politics, Policy and Law, 33 (1985); Traubman, Statutory Reform of \"Toxic Torts\"; Relieving Legal, Scientific and Economic Burdens on the Chemical Victim, 7 Harv. Envtl. L. Rev. 177, 186 (1983). The epidemiologic study undertakes to explore and establish a possible association between a factor and a disease between individuals in a population. B. Black and D. Lilienfeld, Epidemiologic Proof in Toxic Tort Litigation, 52 Forham L. Rev. 732, 755 (1984). Since science cannot yet replicate the exact pathway chemicals travel to reach the injured body, nor yet understand the mechanism of cancer, and since these diseases occur at background level even without apparent cause, an epidemiologic study of the whole population at the site of the exposure rather than of the injured individuals yields a more confident correlation between the exposure and the disease. Note, 26 Wm. and Mary L. Rev. 497, 518 (1985). The inferences derived, therefore, are from group-based information, and so are generalized and statistical. Among those inferences may be the attributable risk: the proportion of the disease that is statistically attributable to the exposure - \"how much more likely that party is of contracting the disease than he was before the exposure.\" M. Dore, Law of Toxic Torts § 25.04[2] and [3] (1988). Thus, epidemiology can establish the increased incidence of the disease in a population from the exposure to the chemical toxin, but not whether the exposure caused the particular disease in a particular person.

Brennan and R. Carter, 10 Journal of Health Politics, Policy and Law at 45; B. Black and D. Lilienfeld, 52 Fordham L. Rev. at 762.

Dore, Law of Toxic Torts § 25.07[1] (1988) and B. Black and D. Lilienfeld, 52 Fordham L. Rev. at 769. The reasons for that acceptance in toxic tort litigation are the refinement of epidemiology as a scientific technique to estimate the proportion of the risk of a disease to exposure to a harmful substance, and the want of better alternative. K. Hall and E. Silbergeld, 7 Harv. Envtl. L. Rev. at 445.\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003eThere were no epidemiological correlations in evidence, however, between exposure to the Alcolac chemicals and the risk of damage or disease to the 8th cranial nerve, the male reproductive function, or of the porphyrin metabolism function of the liver -- biological conditions diagnosed in numerous of the plaintiffs. The biological cause in fact of those diseases was proven by reference by the medical expert to animal bio-assay results. [The sufficiency or competence of that evidence, as we note, to prove biological cause in fact is not a matter Alcolac presents on appeal.] There was no epidemiological evidence adduced to bear on the correlation between exposure to each of those chemicals and the bodily conditions the plaintiffs attribute to the exposure simply because no such study has been conducted. An epidemiological study, the experts testified, is an undertaking usually conducted by governments and foundations, and of a cost few private litigants can afford. [The estimated cost of such a study of the Sedalia population -- even if otherwise possible -- was one million dollars.] In the absence of direct experimentation on humans with a sample size large enough to yield statistically significant results [a cause precluded by ethical considerations], the epidemiological technique can quantify the hazard of exposure only after a significant number of diseases are incurred by those exposed -- and, in the case of increased risk of cancer diagnosed for each plaintiff here -- only after a significant number of deaths have occurred. [It is not only coincidence that by 1983 the National Toxicology Program listed only 22 substances as carcinogens - although 95 more are identified \"for which there exists substantial evidence of carcinogenesis.\" T. Brennan and R. Carter, 10 Journal of Health Politics, Policy and Law at 34.] The lengthy latency period for cancer considered, moreover, assures that any quantified assessment of risk, and hence access to epidemiological evidence for proof of biological cause in fact and recovery, is deferred or precluded altogether to a plaintiff.

Hall and E. Silbergeld, 7 Harv. Envmtl. L. Rev. at 442; Interagency Regulatory Liaison Group , Cancer Policy, 44 Fed. Reg. 39,858, 39,862 (1979). The scientific validity of animal [mostly rodent] tests as a predictive technique rests on the assumption that chemicals behave similarly in different species. The legitimacy of that inference of species-to-species extrapolation rests on the fact \"that fundamental life processes in mammals and other animals are basically the same as humans\" and on the confirmations of a long course extrapolations in biomedical investigations. S. Epstein, The Politics of Cancer, 57 (1978); W. Wagner, 96 Yale L.J. at 432, 442, 444. It has been established, for instance, that animal and human responses are qualitatively similar with respect to all human carcinogens, except arsenic -- and \"arsenic has recently been reported to produce carcinomas of the respiratory tract in hamsters.\" Chemical Carcinogens: A Review of the Science and its Associated Principles, 50 Fed. Reg. 10371, 10411 (1985).

What is available are the extrapolations from epidemiologic, animal and in vitro studies. These are a matter of science and application of sound professional techniques. The relevancy of these extrapolations to attribute disease and biological cause in fact in individual cases is a matter of law. It is evident that scientists assume a significant risk to humans from exposure to chemicals which engender disease and cancer in animals. Animal studies are used and accepted by regulators. See S. Gold, 96 Yale L.J. at 394. It comports well with the substantial factor rule of causation our law applies to such cases [Giles v. Moundridge Milling Co., 173 S.W.2d at 750[6-8]; Restatement (Second) of Torts § 431] to accept the relevancy of \"many types of evidence -- animal and in vitro experiments, epidemiological data, analogous medical cases -- with fact-finders free to decide which of the many inferences urged on them are reasonable.\" Id. That evidence would weigh with proof of substantial exposure to the chemical toxins and injury consistent with exposure to the chemicals. Such test evidence is all the more probative where -- as here -- the claim is not for increased risk of organ injury, but for injury actual and subsistent.\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003e64 The abdominal cancer diagnosed in Mary Landon -- and from which she died -- was also attributed to the exposure to the Alcolac chemicals.

Typically, such proof involves scientific experts - among them, the industrial hygienist, toxicologist, environmental medicine physician, and where the disease manifests only after long latency or where the claim is of significant risk of disease yet to manifest, an epidemiologist and statistician. These skills are often found in one expert. [Dr. Emmett was presented as an expert in occupational medicine and toxicology. Dr. Carnow was presented as an expert in environmental medicine, toxicology and epidemiology.] It has been observed: \"The best witness, of course, would be a medical doctor thoroughly trained in epidemiology, because the need to integrate biology, statistics and common sense to draw proper inferences requires as broad a background as possible.\" B.

The expenses paid to CCA for the attention to the plaintiffs over the several years until the date of trial - the laboratory tests it sponsored and conducted and for the professional uses of its experts, staff and facilities and off-premises nonstaff consultants and facilities - was $516,311.40. That cost to CCA included environmental, monmedical, tests as well. For instance, the plaintiffs sponsored three separate tests to attempt to establish the source of their symptoms and complaints. That was at a time before they had access to any information as to the kind and quantity of chemicals used by Alcolac. Three sets of tests were undertaken by industrial hygienist Boelter and a crew of other scientists. The first two measured air and water samples at several plaintiff residences and air samples taken near the Alcolac premises. The third, taken under the auspices of a court order, allowed entry onto the Alcolac premises to test the bioponds. The plant was then not in operation, so air samples would have been futile. The cost of the last test alone was $20,272; another of the tests cost $35,000.\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003e75 See Appendix O-1, O-2, O-3.\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003e76 This argument, as others we have noted, is ambivalent. The point on appeal to which we respond relates to the contention of trial error in the admission of the expert opinion of Dr. Carnow on the \"non-medical issue of liability causation.\" [emphasis added] There is no specific point asserted on appeal, here or elsewhere, that any medical opinion of Dr. Carnow improperly attributed to the Alcolac chemicals the \"medical causation\" of any biological condition of any particular plaintiff.\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003eThis recurrent ambivalence in this phrase of argument rests on the insistent Alcolac refusal to accept the effect of its own evidence that diagnosis in environmental medicine is inseparable from cause: that is to say, diagnosis subsumes the valid scientific proof of every element of the toxic pathway - from identification of the source of the pollution, to the identification and measurement of the toxic pollutants, to the fact of exposure, to the toxic qualities of the chemical pollutants, to the biological disease that such toxins may be expected to cause, to the determination of such biological disease in the persons of the plaintiffs.

Instruction No. 9A, however, was withdrawn in the face of the Alcolac objection to the inclusion of paragraph Second and Instruction No. 9 issued instead - as conformed to delete the finding that \"Alcolac thereby caused toxic chemicals to escape from Alcolac's premises and to contact and poison plaintiff.\"\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003eA direct response to the contention on appeal would entail, not whether or not Instruction No. 9 as formulated conforms to the theory of MAI that a jury receives only ultimate issues for resolution, but whether one adversary may, by contradictory objections, create an intractable quandary for the other who in good faith attempts to heed them. It would entail whether MAI and the rationale of Fowler v. Park Corp., 673 S.W.2d 749 (Mo. banc 1984) discountenance a litigant from complaint of error as to a modification his own objection has induced. We have determined that the finding and lack of finding, variously, Alcolac contends for was not an issue in genuine dispute, and hence this aspect of the point on appeal is without merit.\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003e87 There was recurrent, spirited debate during pretrial, actual trial, and the interstices in chambers as to whether the burden to discount other industrial activities in the environs as alternative sources of the toxins the plaintiffs claimed brought on their diseases properly rested on the plaintiffs as part of the case in chief, or was a matter of affirmative defense for Alcolac. In the course of a particularly animated cross-examination of Dr. Carnow, the contention between counsel over that point of law erupted before the jury. It is a separate assignment of error by Alcolac, which we answer now, that the request for mistrial at the Conclusion of that open debate should have been granted. The denial of mistrial was certainly within the discretion allowed the trial court in its management role, if for no other reason than that there was no objection to the interchange, except only the motion for mistrial. The motion to strike the remarks of plaintiffs' counsel, lodged thereafter, was also denied. The record justifies the sense of the trial court action - that there was a parity of culpability.\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003eAs we note, with the announced purpose to avoid concern for error, the plaintiffs undertook the proof of the issue. It was the agreed testimony of experts Emmett and Carnow that it is the very function of environmental diagnosis to establish \"a causal diagnosis for a bodily state,\" an inquiry wherein cause and diagnosis are inseparable. It is a diagnosis, as our Discussion explains, which not only must assess the source, identity and biological effects of the toxic emissions to arrive at a true etiology from among numerous possible causes, but also differentiates individual risk variables, host and exogenous factors to settle on that cause which explains the complaint with satisfactory scientific probability. So also, and logically, the environmental medicine investigator takes into account alternative sources to derive a scientifically sound cause and diagnosis. Thus, where, as here, the evidence allows a reasonable inference of alternative sources to explain the injury of disease the plaintiffs claim, the medical opinion - as here - must eliminate the alternative source as a biological cause of the complaint or assign its due etiologic significance. In a case such as this, where the plaintiffs claim chronic effects from toxic chemical exposure [so that the substantial factor test of causation in fact applies] the alternative causation issue is more aptly submitted by the 19.01 modification option: \"Third, such negligence either directly caused damage to plaintiff or combined with the . . . to directly cause damage to plaintiff.\"\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003e88 The prognosis of increased risk of cancer was entered for all of the plaintiffs except Mary London who had, by the time of trial, already contracted the disease. She died during the pendency of appeal. Dr. Carnow described Mary Landon as \"the first one to show her cancer.\" The expert attributed her cancer to the Alcolac emissions.\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003e89 The opinion of increased risk of cancer - as on omnibus prognosis for all of the plaintiffs - was not probative for another reason. It was not supported by the evidence as to plaintiffs John Phillips and Kay Turley. The opinion of increased risk of cancer rested on two premises: all of the plaintiffs had been exposed to multiple carcinogens and that their immune systems - \"which is the major defense against cancer\" - was damaged. The DIAGNOSIS chart meticulously devised by the witness for each plaintiff and explained as to each entry was devoid of indication of any immune system disregulation, dysfunction or even abnormality as to plaintiffs John Phillips and Kay Turley.\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003e90 The unwillingness of Dr. Carnow to quantify the risk of cancer his medical diagnosis attributed for every plaintiff rested on the premise that \"there is not enough information in science to do that.\" An accepted means to quantify risk of disease is by the epidemiologic study. [See footnote 61 and Note, An Analysis of the Enhanced Risk Cause of Action, 33 Vill. L. Rev. 437, 457 (1988)]. We note that in the course of testimony, Dr. Carnow, an expert toxicologist, alluded to an epidemiologic study which \"more strongly prove\" that exposure to epichlorohydrin presents a risk of cancer to humans. In evidence also was the acknowledgment of Alcolac expert Emmett that recent publications conclude that epichlorohydrin presents a risk of cancer to humans. A medical opinion of increased risk of cancer, albeit rendered quantitatively, nevertheless remains a clinical diagnosis and, as such, properly rests on clinical as well as scientific data. Jackson v. Johns-Manville Sales Corp., 781 F.2d at 411; Sterling v. Velsicol Chem. Corp., F.2d adopted August 29, 1988 (Westlaw Allfeds Libs.).\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003e91 The error we determine as to the evidence and argument of increased risk of cancer is that the cause of action, even if current, was not quantified and could not have been proven, and so those trial events only served to confound the legitimate issues. That error affects all of the plaintiffs, except Mary Landon. There was no claim of increased risk of cancer as to Mary Landon, but of a cancer, actual, diagnosed and treated. The DIAGNOSIS chart devised by Dr. Carnow for Mary Landon includes abdominal cancer as a subdiagnosis. It was the opinion of Dr. Carnow, based on reasonable medical certainty, that the abdominal cancer was caused by the prolonged exposure to Alcolac carcinogens. That opinion rested on the numerous factors of risk assessment which impinge on the determination of generic and biologic causation in fact. That opinion gave a prominent role to the process of cancer induction to the quality of epichlorohydrin as a direct carcinogen. The medical opinion that the Alcolac chemicals caused the abdominal cancer in Mary Landon was derived as a differential diagnosis which took into account personal, occupational, medical factors and risk variables.\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003eAlthough Alcolac assails the \"methodology\" by which this and the other diagnoses and medical opinions of Dr. Carnow were derived [arguments we full considered and rejected], there is no contention against the competency of the scientific data on which the medical opinions rest. To be sure, the motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdicts asserts the encompassed contentions that there was no substantial proof that Alcolac ever emitted from the premises any injury-causing substance which any plaintiff ever inhaled or ingested, or that \"any act or emission of defendant was ever linked or connected to any injury of the plaintiff.\" Since it was acknowledged - and in any event under the evidence cannot be disputed - that the acute physical effects suffered by the plaintiffs were attributable to the Alcolac emissions, the point on appeal that there was not cause in fact proven between the Alcolac activity and any biological injury to any plaintiff is not tenable.\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003eThe Alcolac appeal, however, does not assert any specific contention that, as to any specific diagnosis of chronic disease the evidence attributes to its operations, the diagnosis was incompetent as unsupported by reliable scientific data. To be sure [see footnote 61, supra], the Alcolac experts did dispute that the diagnoses of disease of the 8th cranial nerve, the male reproductive function, and of the porphyrin metabolism from exposure to the identified Alcolac chemicals were scientifically valid. It is not a matter Alcolac presents on appeal, however, any more than is the diagnosis of abdominal cancer in Mary Landon. Therefore, any such question is not before us. Thummel v. King, 570 S.W.2d 679, 685 et seq. (Mo. banc 1978).\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003eThere remains the diversion of medical opinion between Dr. Carnow and the Alcolac experts Emmett and Kerby, as to the etiology of the abdominal cancer in Mary Landon as a matter of differential diagnosis. The Alcolac experts did not contest that the cancer was a disease that exposure to the Alcolac chemicals could induce. It was the testimony of the Alcolac and plaintiffs' immunologists, toxicologists and physicians alike, that exposure to the Alcolac chemicals could result in the suppression of the immune system. It was the testimony of Alcolac immunologist Stechschulte that a disregulated immune system could result in cancer. He gave opinion that the radiation treatment for the cancer \"could certainly have been a possibility\" to explain the \"clearly abnormal\" immune system the tests of Mary Landon revealed. It was the opinion of Dr. Carnow, rendered as a reasonable medical certainty, however, that the suppression of the immune system was a condition which antedated the cancer radiation treatment, and was caused by the exposure to the Alcolac toxins. The suppressed immune system left her bereft of that defense and vulnerable to the effects of the Alcolac carcinogens, to which she then succumbed. The radiation simply reinforced the dysfunction of an immune system already suppressed. It was the opinion of Dr. Emmett, on the other hand, that a genetic cause was \"much more strong and likely\" than exposure to the Alcolac chemicals: the condition of congenital spherocytic anemia. It is a condition, as Dr. Emmett understood from the family history, which has resulted in leukemia-related cancer in \"several people of the family.\" That basis for etiology diagnosis, Dr. Carnow explained, was mistaken from misconception harbored by Mary Landon and then related to Dr. Emmett as part of her family history - and by him used as a premise of diagnosis. The medical records confirm, rather, that the family malady was not related to leukemia or any other form of pre-cancer, but was an anomaly of the red blood cells. The anomaly is corrected by a splenectomy - the removal of the spleen.

The question of the biological causation of the abdominal cancer in Mary Landon was not that of the competency of the opinion, but its credibility.

They assume also that MAI 4.02 is the proper instruction to measure damages in such a case. But see Scantlin v. City of Pevely, 741 S.W.2d 48, 51[7] n.4 (Mo. App. 1987); Spain v. City of Cape Girardeau, 484 S.W.2d at 505[5]; Stewart v. Marshfield, 431 S.W.2d 819, 822 (Mo.

See Notes on Use (1983 Revision).\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003e95 MAI 3.01 is the general burden of proof instruction in civil cases.\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003e96 The burden to prove a charge beyond a reasonable doubt is the onus the law imposed upon the prosecution in criminal cases. MAI-CR 3d §§ 300.02 and 302.04.\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003e97 The strict logic of the order would sustain, rather than annul, the identical punitive damages awards since they rest on identical evidence that, as to all the plaintiffs, Alcolac acted with \"complete indifference to or conscious disregard for the safety of others\" - the jury finding prerequisite to a return of punitive damages under MAI 10.02.\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003e98 Alcolac argues: \"It cannot be doubted, nor is any other Conclusion permissible, that the jury did not give the evidence the fair, dispassionate, considered exercise of judgment required.\" It is not, as we note, an allowable appellate exercise to peer into the privacy of jury deliberations to explore for illogical, mistaken or careless assessment of evidence to explain awards of damages. The overt conduct of the jury was indifferent to the evidence before it. The deliberations extended over three days, and during that course made six separate requests to the court for exhibits, among them: photographs of the plant, the liquid incinerator, WAPORA documents and reports, Alcolac documents and reports, laboratory test results, immunologist Zahalsky's charts, and other such data material to the issues of liability and damages. If such musings were permissible, the uniform awards were more plausibly explained by the Alcolac insistence that all thirty-one claims be submitted and argued together, rather than by separate closing arguments on damages, separate deliberations and, hence, verdicts.\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003e99 Our delineation of the individual diagnoses does find that a few of the manifestations of disease or dysfunction attributable to Alcolac do not rest on substantial evidence, and notes them. They are not significant to this Discussion.\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003e100 Those plaintiffs with among the lowest life expectancy - Virgil Bradley, 10.67 years, Dorothy Bradley, 13.05 years, Dainie Landon, 11.26 and Malva Gehlken, 20.10 years - were those whose immune systems had already so deteriorated as to require biannual test panels.\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003e101 At the time of the order which set aside the damage awards, one of the few traditional means open to a court to control the jury action on damages - the remittitur - had been abolished. See Firestone v. Crown Center Redevelopment Corp., 693 S.W.2d 99, 110 (Mo. banc 1985). The power of a court to order remittur was thereafter restored by § 537.068, RSMo Supp. 1987.\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003e102 Evidence of net worth is relevant on the issue of punitive damages, but not prerequisite to an award. Mullen v. Dayringer, 7005 S.W.2d 531, 536[11, 12] (Mo. App. 1985).\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003e103 The deposition of Alcolac president Anderson was not in evidence, no doubt, because he was presented as a witness at the trial. Anderson was also a certified public accountant and shared the responsibility for the Alcolac budget and was qualified to testify as to the net worth of the corporation. Neither the plaintiffs nor the defendant, however, undertook to elicit that evidence from him - for the reasons our opinion makes out.\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003e104 The distrust of the integrity of the financial statements these practices engendered, the plaintiffs state in their briefs, prompted them not to offer the annual reports into evidence. They state also that, had Alcolac introduced the reports or other evidence to prove a net worth of $15,300,000 [or, we assume, any comparable worth], the plaintiffs were prepared to show that the Alcolac assets were regularly siphoned by the foreign parent conglomerate, Rio-Tinto Zinc, a corporation with a net worth \"measured in billions of dollars.\" There is nothing in the evidence or record on appeal, as such, to validate that assertion. There is a lengthy affidavit of counsel for plaintiffs which appends the reply brief. It details certain \"facts\" gathered during intensive pretrial discovery: the purchase of Alcolac in 1981 by Rio-Tinto Zinc Corporation, PLC, an English company, the identity of management, the net worth of Rio-Tinto Zinc of Two Billion Three Hundred Fifty-Four Million Four Hundred Thousand Pounds Sterling, the \"directing upstream of\" dividends from Alcolac to Rio-Tinto, and the \"complete authority and control\" of Rio-Tinto, to approve, modify or reject the Alcolac operating budget. Other than for the acknowledgment at the trial by Anderson that Alcolac was owned by Rio-Tinto, however, these assertions by Affidavit remain only insinuations of counsel, as does the Alcolac representation of a $15,300,000 net worth.\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003e105 In fact, during the deliberations the jury expressly requested the Alcolac annual reports, but were properly denied by the court: \"Dear Jury - The exhibit you have requested was read from only, and not offered or received in evidence.
