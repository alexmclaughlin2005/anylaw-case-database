    "body": "1. Trial Court -- Dismissal\n\n\"The trial court, in appraising the sufficiency of a complaint on a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, should not dismiss the complaint unless it appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of his claim which would entitle him to relief. Conley v. Gibson, 355 U.S. 41, 45-46, 78 S.Ct. 99, 2 L.Ed.2d 80 (1957).\" Syllabus Point 3, Chapman v. Kane Transfer Co., Inc., W.Va. , 236 S.E.2d 207 (1977).\n\n2. Constitutional Law\n\nThe provisions of the Constitution of the State of West Virginia may, in certain instances, require higher standards of protection than afforded by the Federal Constitution.\n\n3. Schools -- Constitutional Requirements\n\nThe mandatory requirements of \"a thorough and efficient system of free schools\" found in Article XII, Section 1 of the West Virginia Constitution, make education a fundamental, constitutional right in this State.\n\n4. Constitutional Law -- Equal Rights\n\nBecause education is a fundamental, constitutional right in this State, under our Equal Protection Clause any discriminatory classification found in the State's educational financing system cannot stand unless the State can demonstrate some compelling State interest to justify the unequal classification.\n\n5. Constitutional Law -- Schools\n\nThe Thorough and Efficient Clause contained in Article XII, Section 1 of the West Virginia Constitution requires the Legislature to develop a high quality State-wide education system.\n\nPlaintiffs, parents of five children attending public schools in Lincoln County, brought action on behalf of themselves and as a class for declaratory judgment on claim that system for financing public schools violates West Virginia Constitution by denying plaintiffs the \"thorough and efficient\" education required and by denying them equal protection of the law; plaintiffs claimed out-of-balance funding in property-poor counties compared with those in more wealthy counties. The Circuit Court, Kanawha County, Robert K. Smith, Judge, dismissed the complaint and denied plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment, and plaintiffs appealed.\n\nAppellants are parents of five children who attend the public schools of Lincoln County. They filed this action for declaratory judgment in the Circuit Court of Kanawha County on behalf of themselves and as a class action on behalf of the other students in the Lincoln County school system. Defendants are the State Treasurer and State Auditor, the members of the West Virginia State Board of Education and the State Superintendent of Schools.\n\nThe Pauleys allege that our system for financing public schools violates West Virginia's Constitution by denying plaintiffs the \"thorough and efficient\" education required by Article XII, Section 1, and by denying them equal protection of the law. They particularly direct us to inequalities that exist in secondary education opportunity and achievement, created by markedly out-of-balance annual funding, facilities, curriculum and personnel of schools in property-poor counties, such as Lincoln, compared with those in more wealthy counties in the State.\n\nThe first section of our Constitution's education article is:\n\n\"The legislature shall provide, by general law, for a thorough and efficient system of free schools.\"\n\nThe Constitution's equal protection mandates are:\n\n\"No person shall be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law . . . .\" [Article III, Section 10] \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e2\u003c/span\u003e\n\nand\n\n\"The courts of this State shall be open, and every person, for an injury done to him, in his person, property or reputation, shall have remedy by due course of law; and Justice shall be administered without sale, denial or delay.\" [Article III, Section 17] \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e3\u003c/span\u003e\n\nThe case was decided on pleadings, admissions, affidavits and statistical material from public documents. No testimony was offered. Plaintiffs moved for summary judgment; defendants moved to dismiss because the complaint did not state a cause of action.\n\nThe court then made factual findings to the effect that the Lincoln County school system is inadequate, \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e4\u003c/span\u003e apparently by comparison with four other counties: Kanawha, Marshall, Brooke and Hancock.\n\nIts legal Conclusions were that State government has not created a thorough and efficient system of public schools in Lincoln County, but has met \"the constitutional mandate in some counties. . . .\" Also:\n\n\"here has been no evidence that public school children residing in those [property-poor] counties are necessarily poorer than such children who reside in counties with higher overall property values. In the absence of such evidence, the classification here has not been shown to be based on social class or wealth of the plaintiff class, but merely to be based on geography of county lines. The nature of the classification thus does not fall into that category of classifications which are automatically considered to be suspect.\" [R. 330]\n\nSo equal protection guarantees were inapplicable.\n\nThe court dismissed the complaint, denied plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment, and plaintiffs appealed, asserting:\n\n\"1. The Circuit Court should have granted the relief requested by plaintiffs in light of its findings of fact and its Conclusions of law that Lincoln County schools are inadequate under the 'thorough and efficient' constitutional standard of the State of West Virginia.\n\n\"2. The Circuit Court should have granted the relief requested by plaintiffs in light of its findings that significant disparities exist among West Virginia counties in the quality and extent of educational services provided, thus constituting a violation of equal protection and due process principles safeguarded by the West Virginia Constitution.\" [Appellants' Brief at 8]\n\nWe note what may have been a fundamental procedural error. Apparently defendants' motion to dismiss was granted because plaintiffs had not demonstrated, in their affidavits, admissions and other documents, that the poor school system in Lincoln County is a product of the present school financing system as they alleged. This may have been sufficient reason to deny plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment, but could not justify granting a motion to dismiss against them. A motion to dismiss is designed simply to test the legal sufficiency of a complaint. We have held that such motions are not favored and in considering them, plaintiffs' factual allegations must be construed favorably to them and considered for purposes of the motion to be true. John W. Lodge Dist. Co. v. Texaco, Inc., W.Va. , 245 S.E.2d 157 (1978).\n\nThe trial court in its memorandum opinion recognized that the plaintiffs had asserted valid constitutional challenges to the present school financing system. It was not their legal theories that were deficient, and therefore a motion to dismiss was improper.\n\nIt is true that defendants filed an affidavit by Dr. James T. Ranson which questioned some of plaintiffs' factual allegations, but the court did not consider it to be a summary judgment request by defendants under Chapman v. Kane Transfer Co., W.Va. , 236 S.E.2d 207 (1977). Even if it had elected to do so, summary judgment for defendants would have been inappropriate because defendants' affidavit did no more than raise issues of material fact. We have held that even though both parties move for summary judgment, the court cannot thereby dispose of the case where disputed issues of facts exist. Aetna Casualty \u0026 Surety Co. v. Federal Insurance Co. of New York, 148 W.Va. 160, 133 S.E.2d 770 (1963).\n\nThe case must be remanded for further evidentiary development and, because there are significant and far-reaching public issues involved, it is advisable that we propose certain guidelines to the Circuit Court. We shall analyze applicable constitutional standards and then review the State's role in education and identify areas that require evidentiary development to allow judgment of the State's performance of its role.\n\nTHE CONSTITUTIONAL ISSUES\n\nEqual Protection\n\nThe trial court correctly recognized that federal Fourteenth Amendment equal protection rights are not available to children seeking educational equality. San Antonio Independent School District v. Rodriguez, 411 U.S. 1, 36 L.Ed.2d 16, 93 S.Ct. 1278 (1973). \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e5\u003c/span\u003e It properly concluded that a state is not constrained by the federal constitutional standard, but must examine its own constitution to determine its education responsibilities. It relied upon similar analyses made by other state courts. Horton v. Meskill, 172 Conn. 615, 376 A.2d 359 (1977); Robinson v. Cahill, 62 N.J. 473, 303 A.2d 273 (1973). We have stated that we may interpret our own Constitution to require higher standards of protection than afforded by comparable federal constitutional standards. Adkins v. Leverette, W.Va. , 239 S.E.2d 496, 499 (1977).\n\nRobinson affirmed a lower court judgment, holding the New Jersey school financing statute to be unconstitutional. The case has considerable relevance to our jurisdiction, because New Jersey's constitution contains a thorough and efficient clause and an equal protection section. We will mention the former later.\n\nThe court discussed equal protection and concluded that its legislature was required to provide a thorough and efficient education system throughout the state; that this made education a fundamental, constitutionally mandated right in New Jersey; and therefore the educational funding system must be strictly scrutinized to see if there was a compelling state interest served by any statutorily created inequalities. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e6\u003c/span\u003e\n\nHowever, the Robinson court refused to place entire reliance on its equal protection clause to test the state's school financing formula, because it recognized there may be instances where the state must spend unequal amounts among the various school districts or counties:\n\n\"We hesitate to turn this case upon the State equal protection clause. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e7\u003c/span\u003e The reason is that the equal protection clause may be unmanageable if it is called upon to supply categorical answers in the vast area of human needs, choosing those which must be met and a single basis upon which the State must act. . . .\" [62 N.J. at 492, 303 A.2d at 283]\n\n\"This is not to say that public education is not vital. Of course it is. Rather we stress how difficult it would be to find an objective basis to say the equal protection clause selects education and demands inflexible statewide uniformity in expenditure. . . .\" [62 N.J. at 495, 303 A.2d at 284]\n\nWe find merit in this approach that avoids narrow strictures upon education financing, a task that is certainly multi-faceted and not easily categorized.\n\nCalifornia has used its equal protection clause on two occasions to strike down state financing formulas which were based in part on a district property tax system that caused districts with low property bases to receive less educational funds. Serrano v. Priest, 18 Cal.3d 728, 135 Cal. Rptr. 345, 557 P.2d 929 (1976); Serrano v. Priest, 5 Cal.3d 584, 96 Cal. Rptr. 601, 487 P.2d 1241 (1971).\n\nThorough and Efficient \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e8\u003c/span\u003e\n\nEducation sections in state constitutions (there is, of course, no specific reference to public education in the United States Constitution) \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e9\u003c/span\u003e can be classified according to whether they reasonably may be considered to require legislatures to provide for public school systems of specified quality, or simply say that public school or uniform public school systems may or shall be established. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e10\u003c/span\u003e\n\nConstitutional mandates that legislatures provide thorough and efficient education systems which is the traditional quality requirement we have found \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e11\u003c/span\u003e are in the Ohio, Minnesota, Maryland, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Illinois (from 1870 until 1970), and West Virginia Constitutions. Colorado, Idaho and Montana require thorough systems; and Arkansas, Texas, Kentucky, Delaware, Virginia (until 1971), and Illinois (since 1970), efficient systems. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e12\u003c/span\u003e\n\nIt has been instructive to us to examine all debates in the constitutional conventions that produced thorough and efficient education clauses, attempting to find definitions, explanations of intentions; to find whether the words were hyperbole or were meant to have legal significance (as one might presume every constitutional pronouncement to have).\n\nOur research produced useful dialogues in the Ohio and West Virginia Conventions, and we have included abbreviated parts in this opinion.\n\nWe have also examined all the cases applying \"thorough and efficient,\" \"thorough\" or \"efficient\" constitutional standards (or refusing to apply them) decided in the fifteen states, and have culled and included herein mention of those that help us find how courts have treated the Thorough and Efficient Clause.\n\nConstitutional Debates\n\nThe 1851 Ohio Constitution was the first to use the words \"thorough and efficient\" to describe the education system mandated to be established by its legislature. Article VI, Section 2, adopted by the Ohio Constitutional Convention on March 8, 1851, was:\n\n\"The General Assembly shall make such provisions, by taxation or otherwise, as with the income arising from the school trust fund, will secure a thorough and efficient system of common schools throughout the State ; [emphasis supplied]; but no religious, or other sect or sects, shall ever have any exclusive right to, or control of any part of the school funds of this State, [ nor shall the rights of conscience be in any case interfered with.]\" [Emphasis in original] [ Report of the Debates and Proceedings of the Convention for the Revision of the Constitution of the State of Ohio, 1850-51, at 843] \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e13\u003c/span\u003e\n\nThis had been the third section of the Convention's education committee's second report, which, on February 24, 1851, was in these words when debated by the Convention:\n\n\"The General Assembly shall make such provisions, by taxation or otherwise, as, with the income arising from the school trust funds, will secure a thorough and efficient system of common schools throughout the State, and place the means of instruction in the common branches of education, for a suitable portion of each year, within the reach of all the children therein, of suitable age and capacity for learning. . . .\" [ Ohio Debates at 698]\n\nThere are portions of the debates about the February 24 report that are enlightening (though they are available only in summary, and not verbatim):\n\n\"MR. ARCHBOLD . . . hoped to see common schools advance, not only to meet such demands as are now made upon them, but to meet higher and greater requisitions. Then the common of the future will need to be far above the common of the present. He wanted to see a system of schools as perfect as could be devised, and to see it improve so as to keep pace with the most rapid progress of the most rapid element of our social or political constitution. . . .\" [ Ohio Debates at 698] [Emphasis supplied]\n\nThe inability of poorer areas to support schools with the same munificence as wealthier areas was discussed, and when an amendment that would have required six-month school terms was offered to the February 24 report, one proponent's remarks fix the state's responsibility to all the children:\n\n\"MR. BARNET of Montgomery. I am in favor of prescribing the longest time for sustaining common schools. I only regret that I cannot have the opportunity to vote for sustaining common schools nine months in the year. I consider, sir, that the children of the State are the property of the State; and that it is the duty of the State to educate them for usefulness. And that the funds of the State are amply sufficient to educate all the children of the State, no man in his senses can doubt. . . .\" [ Ohio Debates at 703] [Emphasis supplied]\n\nThere was no explicit definition of the words \"thorough and efficient\" that appeared in the final committee report which the 1851 Ohio Convention adopted. The tenor of the Discussion, however, by those advocating the entire education section as it was finally adopted, leaves no doubt that excellence was the goal, rather than mediocrity; and that education of the public was intended to be a fundamental function of the state government and a fundamental right of Ohioans.\n\nThe Minnesota Constitutional Convention of 1857 was next to include \"thorough and efficient\" in its education article. It did, in fact, apparently emulate Massachusetts \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e14\u003c/span\u003e and Ohio phraseology, without debate useful to us.\n\n\"Section 1. Wisdom and Knowledge, as well as Virtue, are essential to the preservation of rights and liberties of the people, therefore: It shall be the duty of the Legislature of this State to cherish the interests of Education in Literature and Science, and to establish a general system of Public Schools; to encourage public and private instruction for the promotion of Agriculture, Arts, Science, Commerce, Trade, Manufactories, and Natural History of the Country; and to adopt all means which they may deem necessary and proper to secure to the people the advantages and opportunities of Education.\n\n\"Section 3. The Legislature shall make such provisions, by taxation or otherwise, as, with the income arising from the School Fund, will secure a thorough and efficient system of Schools in each Township in the State.\" [ The Debates and Proceedings of the Minnesota Constitutional Convention at 437-38]\n\nWe found no enlightening dialogue in any of the other conventions from which education articles with mandates for state thorough and efficient school systems emanated, to aid us in definition or delineation of the terms. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e15\u003c/span\u003e\n\nWest Virginia was the third state to incorporate the thorough and efficient mandate in its basic law. Our \"Convention to frame a Constitution for the proposed new State of Kanawha\" convened in Wheeling on November 26, 1861, and one week later received the first of several proposed educational articles referred by its education committee. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e16\u003c/span\u003e\n\nThe committee's first report was presented on January 22, 1862, by Gordon Battelle, its chairman. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e17\u003c/span\u003e Battelle prevailed on every crucial issue that would have diluted the State-unit plan; that would have limited general taxation and expenditures by the State government for schools; or even would have given the Legislature a specific period of grace in which to establish a system. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e18\u003c/span\u003e The result was an article that included as its second section:\n\n\"The Legislature shall provide, as soon as practicable, for the establishment of a thorough and efficient system of free schools. They shall provide for the support of such schools by appropriating thereto the interest of the invested school fund; the net proceeds of all forfeitures, confiscations and fines accruing to this State under the laws thereof; and by general taxation on persons and property or otherwise. They shall also provide for raising, in each township, by the authority of the people thereof, such a proportion of the amount required for the support of free schools therein as shall be prescribes by general laws. [Debates, Vol. III at 881]\n\nOn January 16, 1872, a second West Virginia Constitutional Convention met in Charleston. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e19\u003c/span\u003e The Journal of the Convention contains no debates, but recites all motions, committee reports, resolutions, and votes thereon. Every effort to dilute the mandate was defeated; and it was made even more prominent than in the 1863 Constitution.\n\nIts article on education, Article XII, adopted when the Constitution was approved by the Convention on April 9, 1872, and that fall adopted by the people, remains essentially for our purposes unchanged to this day. The first section is the unequivocally and unencumbered statement that:\n\n\"The legislature shall provide, by general law, for a thorough and efficient system of free schools.\" \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e20\u003c/span\u003e\n\nThorough and Efficient Cases\n\nEach of the fifteen states' appellate courts, and some federal courts, have applied the thorough and/or efficient clauses.\n\nIn all of these states, the clauses have been held to be absolutely mandatory upon legislatures. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e21\u003c/span\u003e\n\nThey all have found the clause to make education a state, rather than local, responsibility. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e22\u003c/span\u003e\n\nBroad legislative authority and discretion have been acknowledged, \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e23\u003c/span\u003e and courts have made for themselves guidelines for testing legislation against the clause.\n\nPennsylvania, in Malone v. Hayden, 329 Pa. 213, 197 A. 344 (1938), said courts can only decide whether legislation has a reasonable relation to the thorough and efficient mandate and whether the \"fruits or effects\" impinge the article by circumscribing it.\n\nIllinois, in People ex rel. Russell v. Graham, 301 Ill. 446, 134 N.E. 57 (1922), said courts cannot interfere unless the legislature creates a system \"which all reasonable men must agree is not an efficient and thorough system, as those terms are commonly and generally understood.\" Id. at 452, 134 N.E. at 60. Yet, in Fiedler v. Eckfeldt, 335 Ill. 11, 166 N.E. 504 (1929), mention is made that Illinois courts will enforce free schools, open to all equally.\n\nKentucky has said it will only question appropriateness of legislation to provide an efficient system of common schools statewide, if the legislation contravenes some other constitutional provision of equal dignity. Board of Education of Louisville v. Board of Education of Jefferson County, 458 S.W.2d 6 (Ky. 1970).\n\nVirginia, in Flory v. Smith, 145 Va. 164, 168, 134 S.E. 360, 362 (1926), limited review to \"the reasonableness of the regulation promulgated. To hold otherwise would be to substitute judicial opinion for the legislative will.\"\n\nTexas holds: \"The Legislature alone is to Judge what means are necessary and appropriate . . . [Its] determination . . . is final, except when so arbitrary as to be violative of the constitutional rights of the citizen.\" Mumme v. Marrs, 120 Tex. 383, 396, 40 S.W.2d 31, 36 (1931). And we have said that the legislature is \"to Judge of the thoroughness and efficiency.\" Kuhn v. Board of Education of Wellsburg, 4 W.Va. 499, 509 (1871).\n\nBut these jurisdictions have not hesitated to examine legislative performance of the mandate, and we think properly so, even as they recite that courts are not concerned with the wisdom or policy of the legislation. State ex rel. Methodist Children's Home Association v. Board of Education of Worthington Village School District of Franklin County, 105 Ohio St. 438, 138 N.E. 865 (1922).\n\nMany courts have recognized the legislative duty to provide necessary funds or power to raise funds to whatever bodies they have delegated education responsibility. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e24\u003c/span\u003e And we are particularly aware of the admonition in 1871 in Kuhn v. Board of Education of Wellsburg, supra :\n\n\"From this clause it is plain, the people intended that the 'thoroughness' and 'efficiency' of the system of free schools, adopted by the legislature, should in no wise be prejudiced by the want of ample means. They make it obligatory upon the legislature to provide for the support of such schools . . . thus placing in the hands of the legislature, for that purpose, plenary, if not absolute, power.\" [4 W.Va. 499 at 509]\n\nBut equality of funding has not been required in the majority of states with mandated thorough and efficient school systems. McInnis v. Shapiro, 293 F. Supp. 327 (N.D. Ill. 1968), aff'd sub nom. McInnis v. Ogelvie, 394 U.S. 322 (1969); Thompson v. Engelking, 96 Idaho 793, 537 P.2d 635 (1975); and Danson v. Casey, 33 Pa. Cmwlth. 614, 382 A.2d 1238 (1978), strike down attacks based on equal protection or due process, upon school financing inequalities. City of Louisville v. Commonwealth, 134 Ky. 488, 121 S.W. 411 (1909).\n\nCourts have often declared that legislatures have plenary authority to determine the bounds of thorough, efficient education. This has been the common way for approving acts deemed to have been intended to improve education systems, when attacked as violating some other constitutional right. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e25\u003c/span\u003e\n\nMany decisions we have reviewed reflect affirmation of judicial deference to legislative plenary power over education, and then judicially approve legislation as being within that power.\n\nWe need not reflect upon the conundrum presented by these several cases -- that the judiciary, bowing to legislative branches' plenariness, hardly ever has refused to speak its approval or disapproval of the legislatures' plenary acts.\n\nHowever, courts have not stopped there. Nearly every one has intervened when an act by a legislature or a proceeding by a local school board, as agent of the legislature, is offensive to judicial notions about what a thorough and efficient education system is.\n\nIllinois is a prime example. The court there has repeatedly deferred to legislative wisdom in matters educational. And yet, it has chosen to disapprove local school district boundary changes specifically ratified by legislation, because the resulting boundaries were not, in the court's opinion, consistent with the \"efficient\" school system constitutionally required. People v. Deatherage, 401 Ill. 25, 81 N.E.2d 581 (1948).\n\nNew Jersey courts have, of course, in Robinson v. Cahill cases, applied their judgment to legislative acts considered to have fallen short of establishing a thorough and efficient school system.\n\nThe Colorado court has Judged that legislatures have inherent power to provide for education, and that the legislature can establish kindergartens even though the constitutionally mandated age for commencement of schooling is six. In re Kindergarten Schools, 18 Colo. 234 (1893).\n\nMontana's court has compelled a local school board to provide education to the only two children in a school district, State ex rel. Lien v. School District No. 73, 106 Mont. 223, 76 P.2d 330 (1938), and enjoined collection of fees for books and materials used in its public schools, Granger v. Cascade County School District No. 1, 159 Mont. 516, 499 P.2d 780 (1972).\n\nThe Kentucky high court required a board of education to act constitutionally after finding that closing a particular school caused the school system to be inefficient. Wooley v. Spalding, 293 S.W.2d 563 (Ky. 1956).\n\nIn Virginia, a statute permitting local elections about whether school boards' real property was needed for public purposes was held to be unconstitutional because it interfered with school boards' constitutional functions. Howard v. County School Board of Allegheny County, 203 Va. 55, 122 S.E.2d 891 (1961).\n\nOur Court has required free textbooks, and has required inclusion of \"state aid to education\" in the budget. Vandevender v. Cassall, W.Va. , 208 S.E.2d 436 (1974); State ex rel. Brotherton v. Blankenship, W.Va. , 207 S.E.2d 421 (1973).\n\nTwo cases represent differences in approach to school finance attacks in thorough and efficient states, and different results. In Danson v. Casey, supra, the Commonwealth Court of Pennsylvania dismissed a challenge to certain statutes that provided state subsidies to public schools. The court specifically found that the statutory scheme, which applied a uniform subsidy formula statewide while at the same time adapting to differences in communities by providing for local taxation, was not discriminatory.\n\n\"The current system is yet another step in continuing legislative attention to correlate State aid formulae with local districts' needs and fiscal capacity. . . . The goal is to equalize educational opportunity and remove that opportunity from dependence upon the student's situs or status. Whether the proper nexus has been maintained between the elements of the subsidy formula and the professed goal has been a source of criticism. . . .\n\n\"It has been held that '[i]n considering laws relating to the public school system, courts will not inquire into the reason, wisdom, or expediency of the legislative policy with regard to education, but whether the legislation has a reasonable relation to [a thorough and efficient system of public schools]. Teachers' Tenure Act Cases, supra, 329 Pa. at 224, 197 A. at 352.\n\n\"Although all educational financing cases are sui generis in the sense that the alleged deprivation is relative rather than absolute, we find no discrimination, invidious or otherwise, in a system that applies a uniform subsidy formula statewide, while at the same time adapting to community diversification by providing for local taxation. To the extent that it aids the promotion of a public school system, the subsidy formula is fair. To the extent that it provides no less than it makes available to other school districts, it is substantial. Given the varying interdistrict educational costs, and the uncertain nexus between the cost and quality of education, we cannot say, as a matter of law, that Pennsylvania's subsidy formula is not fairly and substantially related to ensuring a thorough and efficient system of public education.\" [Footnotes omitted] [382 A.2d at 1242-1245]\n\nThe opinion then interpreted the \"thorough and efficient\" standard:\n\n\"Although we subscribe to the view that Article III, of Section 14, does impose a duty upon the legislature to provide equal educational opportunity to the Commonwealth's school children, and that this duty exists separate and apart from the proscription against special laws contained within Article III, Section 32, we see no reason to apply a test under this section any different from the fair and substantial relation test applied in our equal protection analysis. We do not interpret the mandate to 'provide for the maintenance and support of a thorough and efficient system of public education to serve the needs of the Commonwealth' as to require absolute equality in educational services or expenditures, but rather equality in the relative sense of adapting to local conditions. Challenges predicated upon similar constitutional provisions have succeeded in other jurisdictions by virtue of the reliance placed in those jurisdictions upon local real property tax base in determining either the permissible level of local taxation or the limits of state subsidies, and the manner in which such reliance discriminates against poorer districts. See Serrano v. Priest, 5 Cal.3d 584, 96 Cal. Rptr. 601, 487 P.2d 1241 (1971); see also Horton v. Meskill, supra note 15. We find no such undue reliance in Pennsylvania's equalization grant formula.\" [Emphasis supplied] [382 A.2d at 1246]\n\nThe court then sustained a demurrer to the petition for relief.\n\nDissenting Judges would have found a cause of action stated, and further, \"urely this Court could strike down a system of laws which unconstitutionally deprives school children of equal educational advantages and of the thorough and efficient education promised by the State Constitution. . . .\" [382 A.2d at 1247]\n\nAfter the Superior Court of New Jersey, in Robinson v. Cahill, 118 N.J. Super. 223, 287 A.2d 187 (1972), concluded that education must be raised to a \"thorough\" level in all districts of the state where deficiencies existed and that the school financing system with equalizing factors was not overcoming inequities in the distribution of school funds and tax burdens, New Jersey's Supreme Court, in a persuasive opinion reported in 62 N.J. 473, 303 A.2d 273 (1973), \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e26\u003c/span\u003e held that the school financing scheme did not violate either the federal or state equal protection clauses, but that it did not permit quality education required by the thorough and efficient mandate in the New Jersey Constitution:\n\n\"In the light of the foregoing, it cannot be said the 1875 amendments were intended to insure statewide equality among taxpayers. But we do not doubt that an equal educational opportunity for children was precisely in mind. The mandate that there be maintained and supported 'a thorough and efficient system of free public schools for the instruction of all the children in the State between the ages of five and eighteen years' can have no other import. Whether the State acts directly or imposes the role upon local government, the end product must be what the Constitution commands. A system of instruction in any district of the State which is not thorough and efficient falls short of the constitutional command. Whatever the reason for the violation, the obligation is the State's to rectify it. If local government fails, the State government must compel it to act, and if the local government cannot carry the burden, the State must itself meet its continuing obligation. . . .\n\n\"The trial court found the constitutional demand had not been met and did so on the basis of discrepancies in dollar input per pupil. We agree. We deal with the problem in those terms because dollar input is plainly relevant and because we have been shown no other viable criterion for measuring compliance with the constitutional mandate. The constitutional mandate could not be said to be satisfied unless we were to suppose the unlikely proposition that the lowest level of dollar performance happens to coincide with the constitutional mandate and that all efforts beyond the lowest level are attributable to local decisions to do more than the State was obliged to do.\" [Emphasis supplied] [303 A.2d at 294, 295]\n\nThe Robinson case returned to the New Jersey Supreme Court many times for implementation. Finally, in Robinson v. Cahill, 69 N.J. 449, 355 A.2d 129 (1976), which tested new school financing legislation, the court said it was constitutional assuming it would be fully funded. The new act defined a \"thorough and efficient\" system of public schools, and listed certain elements of such a system. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e27\u003c/span\u003e Power was given the state commissioner to determine that a \"thorough and efficient\" system of public education existed. The court retained jurisdiction to determine whether the new act was being funded.\n\nSo, on the threshold question: no court has been hesistant to affirm legislation; many have required specific actions by local boards to bring them to compliance with the constitutional mandate; and legislation has been declared unconstitutional because it failed the mandate. There is therefore ample authority that courts will enforce constitutionally mandated education quality standards.\n\nNext we must define terms that are basic to the case: \"thorough;\" \"efficient;\" \"education.\"\n\nThere are four traditional methods of judicial definitions of words used in statutes and constitutions and not specifically defined in them: dictionary definitions current at the time, and those now extant; pronouncements by courts; reliable extra-judicial commentary; and definitions set or inferrable from debates and proceedings of the bodies that drew the documents.\n\nA Complete and Universal English Dictionary, by Rev. James Barclay, London, Richard Edwards, 1815, defines \"thorough\": \"he word thorough extended into two syllables . . . complete; passing in at one side, and beyond the other. . . .\"\n\nIt defines \"efficient\": \" cause; one that makes or causes things to be what they are . . . having the power to produce or cause alteration or change in things, either by altering the qualities, or in introducing new ones. . . .\" [at 326]\n\nWebster's Third New International Dictionary, Unabridged, G. \u0026 C. Merriam Company, Springfield, Mass., 1976, definitions are:\n\n\"Thorough . . . marked by completeness; . . . carried through to completion especially with full attention to details; . . . marked by sound systematic attention to all aspects and details; . . . complete in all respects. . . .\"\n\n\"Efficient . . . marked by ability to choose and use the most effective and least wasteful means of doing a task or accomplishing a purpose: competent . . . marked by qualities, characteristics, or equipment that facilitate the serving of a purpose or the performance of a task in the best possible manner; eminently satisfactory in use . . .\"\n\nLexically, then, the words have not changed. The mandate, incorporating the sense of the definitions, becomes a command that the education system be absolutely complete, attentive to every detail, extending beyond ordinary parameters. And further, it must produce results without waste.\n\nThere is a paucity of definitions by courts of \"thorough\" and \"efficient,\" and most are circumbendibus, defining by rulings that such-and-such acts or proceedings further or fail to further thorough or efficient school systems, or identify objectives the words were intended to obtain and thus allow oblique definitions.\n\nOhio's Miller v. Korns, 107 Ohio St. 287, 298, 140 N.E. 773, 776 (1923), attempted forthright definitions: \"An efficient system could not mean one in which part or any number of the school districts of the state lacked teachers, buildings or equipment.\" Board of Education of East Brunswick v. Township Council of East Brunswick, 91 N.J. Super. 20, 218 A.2d 896 (1966), added proper school buildings, equipment and courses of study, and Board of Education of Elizabeth v. City Council of Elizabeth, 55 N.J. 501, 262 A.2d 881, 883 (1970), affirmed the propriety of legislative delegation of overall \"supervisory and central authority\" in the state board of education and state commissioner to act for it.\n\nAssociated Schools of Independent District No. 63 v. School Dist. No. 83, 122 Minn. 254, 142 N.W. 325, 327 (1913), quoting Board of Education of Sauk Centre v. Moore, 17 Minn. 412, puts the constitutional objective: \"o insure a regular method throughout the state, whereby all may be enabled to acquire an education which will fit them to discharge intelligently their duties as citizens of the republic.\"\n\n\"Efficient' has reference not only to the qualifications of the teacher, but relates to other basic matters associated with the school system.\" Ehret v. School District of Kulpmont, 333 Pa. 518, 525, 5 A.2d 188, 192 (1939).\n\nAn equality factor in the concepts of thorough and efficient was recognized in Danson v. Casey, Pa. Cmwlth., 382 A.2d at 1243: \"The goal is to equalize educational opportunity and remove that opportunity from dependence upon the student's situs or status. . . .\" but in a relative way, adapting to local conditions (whatever that may mean).\n\nRobinson v. Cahill, 118 N.J. Super. 223, 268, 287 A.2d 187, 210-211, defines by identifying what a thorough and efficient education system must do: \"[Afford] to every child such instruction as is necessary to fit it for the ordinary duties of citizenship. . . . The word 'thorough' in the Education Clause connotes in common meaning the concept of completeness and attention to detail. It means more than simply adequate or minimal.\"\n\nIllinois has much more restrained definitions, that thorough and efficient schools are open to everyone, and local districts must be compact. People ex rel. Community Unit School District No. 5 v. Decatur School District No. 61, 31 Ill.2d 612, 203 N.E.2d 423 (1965). And in Illinois, efficient schools are strike-free. Board of Education of Community Unit School District No. 2 v. Redding, 32 Ill.2d 567, 207 N.E.2d 427 (1965).\n\nColorado adopted the Wisconsin court's words: \"hildren . . . are the wards of the state, to the extent of providing for their education to that degree that they can care for themselves and act the part of intelligent citizens.\" Fangman v. Moyers, 90 Colo. 308, 312, 8 P.2d 762, 764 (1932).\n\nIdaho excludes from educational thoroughness any element of equal per pupil expenditures, in Thompson v. Engelking, 96 Idaho 793, 537 P.2d 635 (1975).\n\nIn McNair v. School District No. 1, 87 Mont. 423, 288 P. 188 (1930), the Montana court actually asks: \"What, then, constitutes a 'thorough' system of education in our public schools?\" The answer is unspecific: it is a system that trains both mind, morals and body, and furthers \"happiness, efficiency and capacity for social services of the educated. Webster's New International Dictionary.\" [ Id. at 428, 288 P. at 190] Also, access to adequate facilities and materials are ingredients of thoroughness, per Grant v. Michaels, 94 Mont. 452, 23 P.2d 266 (1933).\n\nArkansas has judicially decreed that \"n efficient system of free schools . . . can best be done by and through the [local] boards of education.\" Manley v. Moon, 177 Ark. 260, 264, 6 S.W.2d 281, 283 (1928); efficiency was promoted by regulation of sororities and fraternities, Isgrig v. Srygley, 210 Ark. 580, 197 S.W.2d 39 (1946); and efficiency was promoted by allowing its governor to close schools that in his opinion became inefficient when integrated. Garrett v. Faubus, 230 Ark. 445, 323 S.W.2d 877 (1959).\n\nCreating local school boards for local school districts, building schools, providing free textbooks, and authorizing supporting taxation, were \"[m]achinery for an efficient system of public free schools . . .\" in City of Dallas v. Love, Texas Civ. App., 23 S.W.2d 431, 433 (1930). Also, building a home for teachers might promote efficiency, Adams v. Miles, Texas Civ. App., 35 S.W.2d 123 (1931), as would sale of food and school supplies, Bozeman v. Morrow, Texas Civ. App., 34 S.W.2d 654 (1931), and regulation of student organizations, Wilson v. Abilene Independent School District, Texas Civ. App., 190 S.W.2d 406 (1945).\n\nIn Kentucky, a local board that starved, then closed a high school serving an identifiable part of its constituency, violated the constitutional efficiency mandate. Wooley v. Spalding, supra.\n\nIn Delaware, efficient schools must be supervised by school authorities, Corder v. City of Milford, Del. Super. Ct., 196 A.2d 406 (1963), and local school governance promotes efficiency, Morris v. Board of Education of Laurel Sch. Dist., 401 F. Supp. 188 (D. Del. 1975).\n\nVirginia approves local administration as promoting efficiency, Flory v. Smith, supra, and the local school authorities should control school expenditures, Board of Supervisors of Chesterfield County v. County School Board of Chesterfield County, 182 Va. 266, 28 S.E.2d 698 (1944). Harrison v. Day, 200 Va. 439, 451, 106 S.E.2d 636, 646 (1959), defined efficient in a segregation case: \"t is clear that the word . . . embraces . . . a sufficient number of schools with adequate buildings and equipment, a sufficient number of competent teachers, and other basic matters associated with the public school system. . . . he separation of the races alone will not . . . constitute an 'efficient system.'\"\n\nWe have found efficiency served when the legislature has established \"special high schools, and graded schools in any locality where it may think it wise to do so. . . .\" Herold v. McQueen, 71 W.Va. 43, 49, 75 S.E. 313, 316 (1912), and have decided that in an efficient school system, free textbooks are necessarily made available to indigents. Vandevender v. Cassell, supra.\n\nConstitutional conventioners generally spoke of goals intended by the words they used. Ohio's Archbold's statement that he \"wanted to see a system of schools as perfect as could be devised, and to see it improve so as to keep pace with the most rapid progress of the most rapid element of our social or political constitution,\" describes what a thorough and efficient system should attain.\n\nA Texan argued against one, two or three-month school terms because they would be inefficient.\n\nWest Virginians in the 1861-63 and 1872 Conventions did not expressly define the words they used. Perhaps telling evidence of their intention to mandate a thorough and efficient system of the highest quality educators could devise, was the defeat, at the 1872 Convention, of inclusion of \"common\" as a word descriptive of the schools they intended to be established. In both conventions, the ideals hoped to be obtained were manifested, however.\n\nThe debates and cases often mention that ingredients of a thorough and efficient education system are changeable, and most adapt to conditions its beneficiaries need meet. Malone v. Hayden, supra, and Archbold's statement in the Ohio Convention are examples.\n\nDr. Ambler's commentaries that wealthy schools situate among poor schools did not make a thorough and efficient system are important because they were made about conditions long before there was any thought of judicial challenge to the system. [See Appendix II at 59] Compare the trial court's finding that some West Virginia counties have thorough school systems, and therefore the entire State system is constitutional.\n\n\"Education\" is the remaining word to be defined. The Random House Dictionary, Unabridged Edition (1973), rather concisely defines the word: \"1. he act or process of imparting or acquiring general knowledge, developing the powers of reasoning and judgment, and generally of preparing oneself or others intellectually for mature life. 2. he act or process of imparting or acquiring particular knowledge or skills, as for a trade or profession. . . .\"\n\nAccording to Kaplan v. School District of Philadelphia, 178 Pa. Super. 88, 113 A.2d 164 (1955), and McNair v. School District No. 1, (supra) , it includes cultivation of intellectual culture. We and others include body development, e.g., Wysong v. Walden, 120 W.Va. 122, 196 S.E. 573 (1938).\n\nMcNair, supra, quotes Webster : \"To educate is to 'lead forth, bring up * * * to develop physically,' and education is 'the totality of the qualities acquired through individual instruction and social training, which further happiness, efficiency and capacity for social service of the educated.'\" [87 Mont. at 428, 288 P. at 190]\n\nArkansas has said education is to prepare one for a useful vocation in life. Dickinson v. Edmondson, 120 Ark. 80, 178 S.W. 930 (1915).\n\nWe may synthesize a definition of education from the cases, encyclopedias (28 C.J.S. Education, for example), and dictionaries: It is the development of mind, body and social morality (ethics) to prepare persons for useful and happy occupations, recreation and citizenship. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e28\u003c/span\u003e\n\nWe may now define a thorough and efficient system of schools: It develops, as best the state of education expertise allows, the minds, bodies and social morality of its charges to prepare them for useful and happy occupations, recreation and citizenship, and does so economically.\n\nLegally recognized elements in this definition are development in every child to his or her capacity of (1) literacy; (2) ability to add, subtract, multiply and divide numbers; (3) knowledge of government to the extent that the child will be equipped as a citizen to make informed choices among persons and issues that affect his own governance; (4) self-knowledge and knowledge of his or her total environment to allow the child to intelligently choose life work -- to know his or her options; (5) work-training and advanced academic training as the child may intelligently choose; (6) recreational pursuits; (7) interests in all creative arts, such as music, theatre, literature, and the visual arts; (8) social ethics, both behavioral and abstract, to facilitate compatability with others in this society.\n\nImplicit are supportive services: (1) good physical facilities, instructional materials and personnel; (2) careful state and local supervision to prevent waste and to monitor pupil, teacher and administrative competency.\n\nWe recognize that many facets of public education are being examined by educators, economists, sociologists and other critics. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e29\u003c/span\u003e However, there are undeniable legal bases for all our Conclusions, including the elements specifically distilled from the debates and cases that are the specifications of what a thorough and efficient school system should have, and should do.\n\nConstitutional Issues Conclusion\n\nWe conceive that both equal protection and thorough and efficient constitutional principles can be applied harmoniously to the State school financing system. Certainly, the mandatory requirement of \"a thorough and efficient system of free schools,\" found in Article XII, Section 1 of our Constitution, demonstrates that education is a fundamental constitutional right in this State.\n\nBecause education is a fundamental constitutional right in this State, then, under our equal protection guarantees any discriminatory classification found in the educational financing system cannot stand unless the State can demonstrate some compelling State interest to justify the unequal classification. State ex rel. Piccirillo v. City of Follansbee, W.Va. , 233 S.E.2d 419 (1977); Cimino v. Board of Education of County of Marion, W.Va. , 210 S.E.2d 485 (1974).\n\nHere, the trial court was asked to decide whether the State financing system was so deficient that in certain counties, such as Lincoln, it failed to provide a thorough and efficient system of education. On the record before us, we choose to make no definitive judgment on this point. The trial court was unable to make any judgment either, because it lacked any suitable standards to set the core values of a thorough and efficient educational system.\n\nHowever, given the legally recognized components of thorough and efficient school systems, it is obvious from the circuit court's findings about Lincoln County schools that they are, to say the least, woefully inadequate by those standards, and we would frankly be surprised if the school system will meet any thorough and efficient standard that may be developed on the remand.\n\nOf course, when we talk of setting standards for a thorough and efficient education system, we recognize that expert testimony will be needed. Mere rote comparison with other more affluent counties does not necessarily serve to define the values of such a system.\n\nAnd we emphasize that great weight will be given to legislatively established standards, because the people have reposed in that department of government \"plenary, if not absolute\" authority and responsibility for the school system.\n\nIn summary of the guiding legal principles which must shape the general contours of this case, we find under our State's Equal Protection Clause that because education is a constitutionally derived right in this State, the more demanding strict scrutiny equal protection standard is thrust upon the State.\n\nWe also have determined that the Thorough and Efficient Clause requires the development of certain high quality educational standards, and that it is in part by these quality standards that the existing educational system must be tested. Directly related to this is the further finding that if these values are not currently being met, it must be ascertained that this failure is not a result of inefficiency and failure to follow existing school statutes.\n\nWith these broad principles in mind, we proceed to a further analysis of the current State education statutes to develop specific lines of inquiry on remand. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e30\u003c/span\u003e\n\nDEVELOPMENT ON REMAND\n\nThe Financing System\n\nOur State school aid formula is composed of four basic components: (1) an amount raised from local levy on real and personal property; \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e31\u003c/span\u003e (2) the State foundation aid, which is money the State pays out of general revenue funds to the counties based on a formula composed of seven components; \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e32\u003c/span\u003e (3) State supplemental benefits; and (4) amounts raised locally by special levies by vote of the people in the county. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e33\u003c/span\u003e\n\nWe note initially that no challenge is made to that part of financing for schools that arises from local levies. This issue was raised unsuccessfully in other school financing cases. Robinson v. Cahill, supra; Serrano v. Priest, I \u0026 II, supra; Horton v. Meskill, supra. Article XII, Section 5 of our Constitution expressly states that local taxation on property for school purposes is permitted to the extent that the Legislature may provide by general law:\n\n\"The legislature shall provide for the support of free schools by appropriating thereto the interest of the invested 'school fund,' the net proceeds of all forfeitures and fines accruing to this State under the laws thereof and by general taxation of persons and property or otherwise. It shall also provide for raising in each county or district, by the authority of the people thereof, such a proportion of the amount required for the support of free schools therein as shall be prescribed by general laws.\" \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e34\u003c/span\u003e\n\nWe do not consider, at least facially, that the State's foundation aid statute violates concepts of equal protection, because the gross foundation aid has subtracted from it amounts raised by the county from the regular local property levy. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e35\u003c/span\u003e Thus, a county which generates a small amount from the local property tax receives a larger amount of State foundation aid than does a county with a large local property tax. This is graphically demonstrated by Exhibit B to plaintiffs' brief. [Attached as Appendix IV] The amounts raised from the local property tax by general levy are shown in the first segment on the bar graph. The State foundation aid is the second segment of the graph.\n\nIt is argued on appeal, however, that there are basic inequities in the seven-factor computation by which the foundation aid is computed. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e36\u003c/span\u003e These factual contentions were not developed below and should be explored before the trial court can determine if the State foundation aid meets equal protection standards.\n\nSupplemental State Aid\n\nFrom the record we are unable to make any determination about this part of the State financing formula. It was not discussed by the trial court nor the parties. That it exists is manifested by Exhibit B to the Appellant's Brief. We are not advised of its source or how it flows to the counties. This is obviously a critical area for development below. If supplemental aid can be made available to those counties whose educational systems are below the standards of a thorough and efficient system and this raises them to the standards, which seems unlikely considering the sorry conditions in Lincoln County schools, then the claim of unconstitutionality under the Thorough and Efficient Clause may be dissipated.\n\nTax Revenues from Special or Excess Levy on Property\n\nWhile it is not clear from the record what role the trial court assigned to revenues generated from excess levies voted by citizens in a given county, we believe these revenues are not subject to attack under our Equal Protection Clause.\n\nThe United States Supreme Court has specifically upheld the 60 percent majority vote requirement contained in Article X, Section 1 of our Constitution, as against an equal protection attack on the right to set such requirement in Gordon v. Lance, 403 U.S. 1, 29 L. Ed. 2d 273, 91 S.Ct. 1889 (1971), rev'g 153 W.Va. 559, 170 S.E.2d 783 (1969). Consequently, the voluntary exercise of such right does not violate equal protection standards of either our State or Federal Constitutions. The reason is that the excess taxes arise by the free will of the citizens in the counties, who must, by a 60 percent vote, agree to impose this excess tax on themselves.\n\nThe violation of the equal protection standard usually arises from state action; that is, the act of a legislative body in setting, by some statute or ordinance, an arbitrary classification. Woodring v. Whyte, W.Va. , 242 S.E.2d 238 (1978); O'Neil v. City of Parkersburg, W.Va. , 237 S.E.2d 504 (1977); State ex rel. City of Charleston v. Coghill, W.Va. , 207 S.E.2d 113 (1973); Chesapeake \u0026 Potomac Telephone Co. v. City of Morgantown, 143 W.Va. 800, 105 S.E.2d 260 (1958). Here, these excess levies are determined by the vote of the people. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e37\u003c/span\u003e\n\nThe exemption of excess levy funds from equal protection standards may not prevent them from being counted as available for the thorough and efficient standard.\n\nBut certainly there are limits to the amount of reliance that can be placed on this source of funds, considering the State government's constitutional responsibility to assure a thorough and efficient system of schools.\n\nThe Property Appraisement System\n\nThe trial court acknowledges that one source of disparity between the amounts raised through property taxes in the various counties is that some are poor in property wealth. There is no evidentiary development of this issue, and it should be examined to develop whether the \"poor\" counties are assessing their properties adequately, and whether, per W.Va. Code, 18-9A-11, the State Tax Commissioner reappraises all real property in the counties and to make certain that local assessors are using the Tax Commissioner's values. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e38\u003c/span\u003e This same statute places certain mandatory duties on county courts to allocate out of its levies sufficient funds to produce for county boards of education amounts they would have received had the Tax Commissioner's appraisals been followed. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e39\u003c/span\u003e\n\nUpon remand, evidence must be developed to prove whether Lincoln County's low property tax revenue results from faulty appraisements below those set by the Tax Commissioner. It will also be necessary to calculate the amount of deficiency, if any, to determine the true impact of the State financing formula in Lincoln County. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e40\u003c/span\u003e Moreover, inquiry must be directed in other low property revenue counties to determine if the appraisement provisions are being followed. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e41\u003c/span\u003e\n\nIt is obvious that W.Va. Code, 18-9A-11, reflects legislative perception that equality in property taxes could not occur until uniform property appraisements were set in the various counties. The Legislature's intent to have this section complied with is demonstrated by these broad enforcement and penalty provisions:\n\n(1) \"he state tax commissioner shall review the valuations for assessment purposes made by the county assessor and the county court . . .\n\n(2) \"[The state tax commissioner] shall direct the county assessor and the county court to make such corrections in the valuations as may be necessary so that they shall comply with the requirements of chapter eleven [§ 11-1-1 et seq.] of the Code and of this section, . . .\n\n(3) \"he [state] tax commissioner shall enter the county and fix the assessments at the required ratios. . . .\n\n(4) \"Refusal of the assessor or the county court to make such corrections shall constitute grounds for removal from office.\n\n(5) \"In the event the county court shall fail or refuse to make the reallocation of levies as provided for herein, the county board of education, the tax commissioner, the state board, or any other interested party, shall have the right to enforce the same by writ of mandamus in any court of competent jurisdiction.\" [W.Va. Code, 18-9A-11]\n\nTo the extent that State ex rel. Raese v. Battle, 149 W.Va. 761, 143 S.E.2d 328 (1965), states that the Tax Commissioner is without power to proceed to enforce the provisions of W.Va. Code, 18-9A-11, it is overruled.\n\nThe State School Building Fund\n\nAnother concern is apportionment of the State School Building Fund under W.Va. Code, 18-9C-1, et seq., and particularly the entitlements set out in Section 5. The basic question is whether these funds are allocated in a manner that will provide essential physical facilities to meet the thorough and efficient standard. Again, expert testimony will be needed to develop the appropriate standard. Lincoln County school facilities must be tested by this standard, with some regard to an overall efficient plan.\n\nThe State's Administrative Role\n\nState Board of School Finance\n\nThe Legislature almost forty years ago recognized that: \"Because of the adoption of the Tax Limitation Amendment, it has become necessary for the State to participate to an increasing degree in the financing of the free public schools.\" W.Va. Code, 18-9B-1. It passed what is now W.Va. Code, 18-9B-1, et seq., creating the State Board of School Finance and giving it a variety of administrative and budgetary powers over county boards of education.\n\nWhile there is no need at this time to review each of the provisions of this Article, the trial court on remand should ascertain if the State Board of School Finance has carried out its responsibilities under this Article, and whether Lincoln County has complied with this Article.\n\nState Superintendent of Schools and State Board of Education\n\nW.Va. Code, 18-9A-17, expressly provides that performance of powers and duties given to the State Board of School Finance under W.Va. Code, 18-9B-1, et seq., is ultimately the responsibility of the West Virginia Board of Education and its chief executive officer, the State Superintendent of Schools:\n\n\"Notwithstanding any and all references to the board of school finance as found in article nine-B [§ 18-9B-1 et seq.] of this chapter, the West Virginia board of education, through its chief executive officer, shall direct and carry out all provisions of said article nine-B.\" [W.Va. Code, 18-9A-17]\n\nConsequently, the trial court should require development of the facts about performance of those duties.\n\nIt is also clear that under W.Va. Code, 18-9A-11, the State Board of Education is required to calculate the county's property tax revenues which are subtracted from the State foundation aid. Inquiry should be made to determine if it is complying with this section. This would include determining what appraisement figures it obtains from the State Tax Commissioner.\n\nAccording to W.Va. Code, 18-2-23, the West Virginia Board of Education, through the State Superintendent of Schools, has been required since 1965 to establish \"a comprehensive educational program or programs in county school systems.\" This section also provides for evaluation of existing county school systems on a continuing basis to detect deficiencies and to make recommendations to correct deficiencies.\n\nCertainly on remand the trial court should require a full production of the plans, studies and recommendations made by the Board and the State Superintendent to Lincoln County and State-wide. These studies should be useful in development of standards for a thorough and efficient school system.\n\nWe have previously pointed out that our thorough and efficient constitutional mandate requires something more than a mere equality of educational funding to the counties. Brotherton v. Blankenship, supra, holds:\n\n\"Article 12, Section 1 of the Constitution of West Virginia provides: 'The legislature shall provide, by general law, for a thorough and efficient system of free schools'. It has been held that this section requiring the establishment and maintenance of free schools is an absolute and mandatory duty on the part of the Legislature. State ex rel. Trent v. Sims, 138 W.Va. 244, 77 S.E.2d 122 (1953). . . . It is the view of this Court that the foregoing adequately reflects the will of the people, through the basic law enacted by them, that a thorough and efficient system of free schools is of paramount importance in a free society and that neither the legislature nor the executive branch of government may perform any act which would result in the elimination of this safeguard.\" [Emphasis supplied] [ W.Va. at , 207 S.E.2d at 436]\n\nIt is perhaps appropriate at this point to digress to one of the problems that we see in the record before us. It contains a number of statistical tables and studies with little information about their relevance. Affidavits are admissible in this type of action which is heard without jury, but it will be useful on remand to have evidence elicited about purposes, and explanations of the background compilations of data. Opposing parties may, of course, cross-examine affiants.\n\nThe Local Role\n\nIt is essential that a determination be made on remand, that the Lincoln County Board of Education is fulfilling its responsibilities imposed by the thorough and efficient mandate, in administering its school system.\n\nCertainly, the State Superintendent of Schools, as well as the Lincoln County Superintendent of Schools, should have direct input in this area. These constitutional officers are trained professionals who are required to implement the policies of the State Board of Education and the County Board of Education. Their statutory duties are set out in W.Va. Code, 18-3-1, et seq., and 18-4-1, et seq.\n\nParticular attention is directed to W.Va. Code, 18-5-11, permitting joint establishment of schools by the County Boards of Education of two or more adjoining counties as they operate in conjunction with the authority vested in County Boards under W.Va. Code, 18-5-13, to close and consolidate schools. Obviously, economy and efficiency may be affected by the number of duplicate school facilities that are being operated in the same county.\n\nOn remand, some judgment must be made by educational experts as to whether, under the existing statutes, the Lincoln County school system is being operated in a reasonably efficient manner, before any ultimate decision can be made that the present statutory scheme fails to deliver a thorough and efficient education.\n\nParties\n\nThe Constitution mandates legislative responsibility for a State-wide thorough and efficient school system. The trial court should, upon remand, require the suit to be amended to include the Speaker of the House of Delegates and the President of the Senate of West Virginia as defendants. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e42\u003c/span\u003e Undoubtedly, the expert studies made by various legislative committees will assist in the ultimate formulation of standards for the system. Legislative representatives should have an opportunity to fully explore any of the theories or statistics in the plaintiffs' case to demonstrate any possible errors or deficiencies. As we have said, legislative determinations of standards would be very important and persuasive to us.\n\nWe have previously noted that other essential parties are the State Tax Commissioner, the Lincoln County Superintendent, its School Board, its Assessor and County Court, all of whom are charged with mandatory roles under this State's educational statutes.\n\nConclusion\n\nA \"Sketch of the Erection and Formation of the State of West Virginia from the Territory of Virginia,\" a prefix to 1 W.Va., was included in our first Reporter, \"in order that the events therein recorded may not pass from the memory, and at the same time to provide some accessible memoranda, useful to the lawyer in his practice and convenient for reference by all.\" [1 W.Va. Preface]\n\nThe \"sketch\" at pages 72-73, during Discussion about our 1863 Constitution, has these comments:\n\n\"But the feature of the instrument that demonstrates most clearly the spirit of enlightened patriotism and enlarged sense of genuine interest in the cause of humanity, was the liberal provision for the establishment of a system of free schools.\" \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e43\u003c/span\u003e\n\nOur basic law makes education's funding second in priority only to payment of the State debt, and ahead of every other State function. Our Constitution manifests, throughout, the people's clear mandate to the Legislature, that public education is a prime function of our State government. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e44\u003c/span\u003e We must not allow that command to be unheeded.\n\nWe reverse the judgment of the Circuit Court and remand this case for proceedings as directed.\n\nAPPENDIX I\n\nCLAUSES IN STATE CONSTITUTIONS PROVIDING FOR SCHOOL SYSTEMS\n\nALA.

AMBLER\n\nDr. Charles H. Ambler, in his A History of Education in West Virginia (From Early Colonial Times to 1949) (1951), made perceptive observations about our government's fidelity to providing thorough and efficient education at various periods since 1863.\n\nIn keeping with the conservative tendencies incident to the Panic of 1873 the state school levy remained constant at ten cents during this period. The maximum district levy of fifty cents was also unchanged, but the actual levies varied from county to county as determined by their respective wealth and programs. For instance, ten wealthy counties with an average levy of 18.5 cents for 1873-74 had an average term of four and one-half months, whereas ten poorer counties with an average levy of 39.5 cents had only three and one half months. Furthermore, the average levies of all the counties, aggregating about sixty cents for schools and buildings, plus the state levy for the same year, would have produced a total of about $1,000,000, but under the current practices the total was only $647,000 which did not include $83,000 in capitations.\n\nIn adhering to these inequalities West Virginia was most inconsistent. One of the chief grievances of her former residents against the mother state was that she had taxed the many to educate a few. In turn, the daughter state adhered to the same practice, except that instead of favoring landed aristocrats and the indigent poor, she favored \"Ironheaded Industrialists,\" as residents of the Ohio River counties were sometimes called. From time to time rural units protested against this situation, but they were helpless. More than anything else perhaps these inequalities retarded educational progress in a large part of the state.\n\nThe development was in face of the fact that the constitution required the legislature to provide a \"thorough and efficient\" system. Instead, the actual system, beginning under the Radical leadership which refused to shift the tax burden from the local units to the state, was much like a lot of tumbled down shanties and hovels with here and there in a fine house. From the standpoint of a statewide system the \"fine house\" was a hurdle. To scale it \"Citizen\" in a letter to the Wheeling Register for November 9, 1878, suggested that the constitution be enforced. For that purpose, he would have made the county the administrative unit.\n\nInstead of enforcing the constitution, industrial and agrarian interests took advantage of the depressed economic conditions following 1873 to escape tax burdens. Worse still perhaps, they cultivated a poverty complex from which the state has not yet recovered. In response thereto the 1875 legislature exempted certain farm products from taxation, together with the products of mines, salt wells, oil wells and all manufactured products resulting from mechanical skill and labor. Taking advantage of tax exempt chargers granted by Virginia, railroads were meanwhile paying mere pittances in taxes. As a result of these exemptions and practices the total assessed valuation for the entire state in 1883 was about $11,000,000 less than in 1875, but the legislature, ignoring repeated requests from the governor, failed to correct the situation. Thus the entire educational system, including the state normal schools and the University, languished for lack of financial support.\n\nAnd about the three decades between 1880 and 1909:\n\nUnfortunately for the state's educational interests, the corporate control of its industrial economy was largely non-resident. Inasmuch as there was little available resident capital, leaders vied with each other in making investments attractive to \"out-of-state capital\" which, with the tacit approval of the public generally and in defiance of the state constitution, was given assurances with respect to taxes and to public expenditures. In only a few instances did the leaders, either resident or non-resident, oppose public free schools, but they became a secondary instead of a primary interest, as in the pre-Civil War and the Reconstruction period. Under such conditions the educational leadership and the teaching personnel, with notable exceptions, tended to become second rate, and a tendency, begun in the Reconstruction, of looking to the North for every good thing was heightened. Thomas Jefferson, Dr. Henry Ruffner, and even White and Wade were all but forgotten. Incidentally, the poverty complex of the Reconstruction took on an inferiority complex which, more than anything else perhaps, tended to thwart individual initiative in education. Under the circumstances it was not expected and, when it did appear, it was regarded with suspicion.\n\nMuch of the maladjustment of this period may be accounted for by the fact that the changes were the result of a revolution. To appreciate this, it is recalled that West Virginians, as of 1880 and as determined by their mode of life, were as old as the Babylonians, in that some of them were still using such primitive tools as flails and sickles. At the end of this period most of them were still practicing domestic economy, but an increasing number resided in towns and cities and depended upon industry for subsistence. Because of the limitations of human nature and because of their failure to give more attention to education, they had thus been deprived of a due share of their birthright, in that their natural resources were being exploited rather than developed. Moreover, throughout large areas the inhabitants had been overtaken and in many cases submerged by an arrested economic development. Thus the \"thorough and efficient system of free schools\" authorized in the constitution failed to materialize.\n\n(205-7).\n\nIllustrating the times, Dr. Ambler wrote:\n\nWest Virginia had already joined New Jersey in the market-place for charters for corporations and made a point of asking few or no questions about their character. For that purpose, the secretary of state of West Virginia, carrying the Great Seal of the state with him, had gone to New York City in 1890 and opened temporary sales quarters in a downtown hotel, where, at \"the lowest prices,\" he issued \"all and sundry who wished them.\"\n\n(389).\n\nHe discussed our school financing in the following decades:\n\nThe worst feature of the entire system was its stultifying inqualities. For instance, the per capital wealth per student in the 1920's varied from $841 in Jumping Branch District, Summers County, to $14,664 in Cass District, Monongalia County. The thirty cent levy on these values yielded $1.59 for each child in the former and $48.90 in the latter. At the same time, active rates of taxation for school purposes varied from 37 cents in Freeman's Creek District, Lewis County, to $2.22 in Ripley Independent District, Jackson County. For the year ending 1917 the school term in thirty-seven districts varied from seventy-five to one hundred ten days of the required six month term, and the Survey of Education, made ten years later, indicated that children in rural districts with short terms and poor teachers were far behind children who attended city and consolidated schools.\n\nThe chief difficulty lay in the fact that the wealth of the state was amassed in spots and sections, while other spots and sections were without taxable wealth to support even good elementary schools. As a consequence, in 1924 terms varied from 180 days in fifty-three districts to 160 days or less in three hundred forty-four districts, and the average per capita cost in districts with the longer terms was much less than in those with shorter terms. In the former, buildings and equipment were of the finest sort, whereas in the latter children were crowded into \"huts,\" unpainted and bare, poorly heated, rudely furnished, without libraries and sanitary outbuildings. Moreover, the best teachers were in the wealthy districts which were also provided with supervisors and special instructors in music, drawing, and other subjects. In face of the law requiring property to be assessed at its full and actual value, the assessments in some counties were lowered from year to year so as to boost their shares of the supplemental funds.\n\n(439-40).\n\nDr. Ambler recites in substantial detail, the financial, political and personal involvements in the history of West Virginia education. We suggest perusal of his sections on West Virginia school financing which expose not only the sums invested in education from state and local sources into the 1940's, but the effect our constitutional Tax Limitation Amendment had upon the relative contributions made by local and state taxation.\n\nAPPENDIX III\n\nEDUCATION PROVISIONS FROM THE WEST VIRGINIA CONSTITUTION\n\nARTICLE XII.\n\n1. The legislature shall provide, by general law, for a thorough and efficient system of free schools.\n\n2.

But any portion of said interest remaining unexpended at the close of a fiscal year, shall be added to, and remain a part of, the capital of the \"School Fund:\" Provided, That all taxes which shall be received by the State upon delinquent lands, except the taxes due to the State thereon, shall be refunded to the county, or district by or for which the same were levied.\n\n5. The Legislature shall provide for the support of Free Schools, by appropriating thereto the interest of the invested \"School Fund,\" the net proceeds of all forfeitures and fines accruing to this State under the laws thereof; the State capitation tax; and by general taxation on persons and property or otherwise.

All levies that may be laid by any county or district for the purpose of Free Schools, shall be reported to the Clerk of the County Court, and shall, under such regulations as may be prescribed by law, be collected by the Sheriff, or other collector, who shall make annual settlement with the County Court; which settlements shall be made a matter of record by the Clerk thereof, in a book to be kept for that purpose.\n\n8. White and colored persons shall not be taught in the same school.\n\n9. No person connected with the free school system of the State, or with any educational institution of any name, or grade under State control, shall be interested in the sale, proceeds or profits of any book or other thing used, or to be used therein, under such penalties as may be prescribed by law: Provided, that nothing herein shall be construed to apply to any work written, or thing invented, by such person.\n\n10. No independent free school district, or organization shall hereafter be created, except with the consent of the school district or districts out of which the same is to be created, expressed by a majority of the voters voting on the question.\n\n11. No appropriation shall hereafter be made to any State Normal School, or branch thereof, except to those already established, and in operation, or now chartered.\n\n12. The Legislature shall foster and encourage moral, intellectual, scientific and agricultural improvement; it shall, whenever it may be practicable, make suitable provision for the blind, mute and insane, and for the organization of such institutions of learning as the best interests of general education in the State may demand.\n\nOther of our constitution's provisions mention education:\n\nArticle 10, § 5: \"The power of taxation of the legislature shall extend to provision for the payment of the state debt, and interest thereon, the support of free schools, and the payment of the annual estimated expenses of the State; . . .\" [Our emphasis.]\n\nSection 7 limits county authorities: They \". . . shall never assess taxes, in any one year, the agregate of which shall exceed ninety-five cents per one hundred dollars valuation; except for the support of free schools ; payment of indebtedness . . .\" unless the people of the county approve by three-fifths of the votes cast. [Our emphasis.]\n\nSection 10, called \"Better Schools Amendment,\" states: \"Notwithstanding any other provision of the Constitution to the contrary, the maximum rates authorized and allocated by law for tax levies on the several classes of property for the support of public schools may be increased in any school district . . .\"\n\nAmendments include \"The Irreducible School Fund Amendment\" and the \"Better School Buildings Amendment.\"\n\nTHE IRREDUCIBLE SCHOOL FUND AMENDMENT (1902)\n\nThe accumulation of the school fund provided for in section four of article twelve, of the Constitution of this State, shall cease upon the adoption of this amendment, and all moneys to the credit of said fund over one million dollars, together with the interest on said fund, shall be used for the support of the free schools of the State.\n\nSection 2 of the Education Article was amended in 1957 and ratified in 1958. Today this section reads as follows:\n\nSUPERVISION OF FREE SCHOOLS\n\n§ 2. The general supervision of the free schools of the State shall be vested in the West Virginia board of education which shall perform such duties as may be prescribed by law. The board shall consist of nine members to be appointed by the governor, by and with the advice and consent of the senate, for overlapping terms of nine years, except that the original appointments shall be for terms of one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, and nine years, respectively. No more than five members of the board shall belong to the same political party, and in addition to the general qualifications otherwise required by the Constitution, the legislature may require other specific qualifications for membership on the board. No member of the board may be removed from office by the governor except for official misconduct, incompetence, neglect of duty, or gross immorality, and then only in the manner prescribed by law for the removal by the governor of state elective officers.\n\nThe West Virginia board of education shall in the manner prescribed by law, select the state superintendent of free schools who shall serve at its will and pleasure. He shall be the chief school officer of the State and shall have such powers and shall perform such duties as may be prescribed by law.\n\nThe state superintendent of free schools shall be a member of the board of public works as provided by subsection B, section fifty-one, article six of this Constitution.\n\nBETTER SCHOOL BUILDINGS AMENDMENT (1972)\n\nThe legislature shall have power to authorize the issuing and selling of state bonds, not exceeding in the aggregate two hundred million dollars, which shall be in addition to all other state bonds heretofore authorized. The proceeds of the bonds hereby authorized to be issued and sold shall, notwithstanding the provisions of section six, article ten of this Constitution or any other provision of this Constitution to the contrary, be distributed to such county boards of education as qualify therefor by meeting such conditions, qualifications and requirements as shall be prescribed by general law and used and appropriated by such county boards of education solely for the construction, renovation or remodeling of elementary or secondary public school buildings or facilities, the equipping of the same in connection with any such construction, renovation or remodeling and the acquisition and preparation of sites for elementary or secondary public school buildings or facilities. Such bonds may be issued and sold at such time or times and in such amount or amounts as the legislature shall authorize. When a bond issue as aforesaid is authorized, the legislature shall at the same time provide for the collection of an annual state tax sufficient to pay as it may accrue the interest on such bonds and the principal thereof within and not exceeding thirty-four years, and all such taxes so levied shall be irrevocably dedicated for the payment of principal of and interest on such bonds are finally paid and discharged, and any of the covenants, agreements or provisions in the acts of the legislature levying such taxes shall be enforceable in any court of competent jurisdiction by any of the holders of the bonds.\n\nDOUBLE CLICK TO VIEW APPENDIX\n\nAPPENDIX V\n\nBIBLIOGRAPHY OF MATERIALS CONSULTED BUT NOT CITED\n\nI.

KELLY, TREASURER, STATE OF WEST VIRGINIA, ET AL. -- NO. 14036\n\nNeely, Justice, Dissenting :\n\nWhen the average bright law student first encounters the doctrine that courts will not decide \"political questions,\" it usually appears that such deference to other authorities is more cowardice on the part of the judiciary than anything which passes for statesmanship. However, maturity brings a recognition that all power has its inherent limitations and I Dissent on the grounds that the majority has overstepped the limits of a court. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e1\u003c/span\u003e State supported public education is an area where the other agencies of government are actively working while taking cognizance of other compelling yet competing imperatives, among which are included an appropriate level of taxation, help for the aged, infirm, mentally ill, and destitute along with the more mundane demands upon the public treasury such as roads, sewers, fire protection and police protection.\n\nWhere the other agencies of government totally neglect the needs of a constituency entirely devoid of an effective political voice, as for example Black citizens in 1954, Brown v. Board of Education, 347 U.S. 483 (1954), mental health patients in 1974, State ex rel. Hawks v. Lazaro, W.Va. , 202 S.E.2d 109 (1974) or juvenile status offenders in 1977, State ex rel. Harris v. Calendine, W.Va. , 233 S.E.2d 318 (1977), it may be appropriate for a court to intervene in the political process under the authority of constitutional interpretation because there is no effective political alternative. These cases are distinguishable from the case at bar, however, by the fact that they presented problems susceptible to judicial management. In those cited instances there were structural obstacles to effective political participation by the abused constituency which only the courts could overcome on behalf of those to whom the political process was foreclosed. However, with regard to the particular invitation to judicial activism before as now, the Legislature has committees meeting constantly during its sessions on the subject of education; there is a huge bureaucracy dedicated to carrying out the legislative program; and, there are numerous, powerful, active constituencies who routinely devote time and money to effective (as well as ineffective) lobbying for education.\n\nMany excesses of judicial zeal in attempts to solve problems of government may be analogized to an effort to reduce to possession a part of a balloon full of water; whenever a piece of the balloon is grasped towards the bottom, there will develop a bulge at the top. The courts do not have control of the entire balloon; the courts do not appropriate money; the courts do not tax; and, the courts do not have the manpower or expertise to enforce their orders absent the good will of the other branches. The personal philosophies of Judges may prompt them to attempt to grab a piece of the water balloon, but the bulge which the court creates must be handled by others who often decline to handle it. If then, the bulge is not handled, the courts, unless they are to become laughing stocks, must handle it, which will produce another bulge, until the courts are trying to control the entire balloon. At that point courts cease being courts and become administrators. Obviously when they become administrators they will also, ipso facto, become Judges of their own causes and there ends the separation of powers. This is what the Judges who developed the political question doctrine meant when they spoke of \"judicially manageable standards.\"\n\nThe case before us presents an attempt by parents and public interest lawyers to pry more money from the Legislature while at the same time avoiding the cumbersome legislative/political process with all of the implications which that process entails that something more than the mere appropriation of money may be forthcoming. As originally brought, the suit did not challenge teacher incompetency, nor the existence of an enormous interlocking statutory scheme which guarantees that security of position for those within the educational establishment will take precedence over the education of children. \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e2\u003c/span\u003e That statutory scheme is the result of political bargaining and must be corrected through political bargaining if the result is to have any legitimacy.\n\n\"Thorough and efficient\" education apparently does not mean in this modern world just advanced mathematics, chemistry, physics, foreign languages, competence in written and spoken English, and a well-developed knowledge of history. Something more in the form of vocational training and preparation for life is implied, yet whatever it is, it is far too unmanageable a standard to be developed in a vacuum devoid of political give and take by the logical judicial mind, because inherent in any consensus about \"thorough and efficient\" education is a difficult balance between irreconcilable value systems. I have my own ideas of what constitutes \"thorough and efficient\" education; nonetheless, I am constitutionally constrained not to force them down the throats of other equally well-informed persons who have different values merely because I am a Judge.\n\nAccordingly, as woeful as the West Virginia public education system is, I would affirm the judgment of the lower court because the entire question comes within the classic definition of a \"political question\" set forth in Baker v. Carr, 369 U.S. 186 (1962), where Justice Brennan indicated that a question is not justiciable if it lacks \"judicially discoverable and manageable standards for resolving it.\" 369 U.S. at 217 \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e3\u003c/span\u003e\n\nWhen the Thorough and Efficient Clause is considered, along with other aspects of the statutory scheme of education, it should be apparent that political hiring, teacher tenure, irrational certification requirements, lack of school consolidation, and a host of other considerations, which would present \"the impossibility of deciding without an initial policy determination of a kind clearly for nonjudicial discretion,\" Baker v. Carr, supra at 217, make it impossible to decide these issues without \"the potentiality of embarrassment from multifarious pronouncements by various departments on one question.\" Baker v. Carr, supra at 217.\n\nThe courts can act upon a question such as the one presented in this case only when it is possible to remedy the situation by an order operating upon a discrete aspect of the problem. The lower courts will not find any aspects of the problem of substandard schools which taken alone, under the Thorough and Efficient Clause, can be acted upon by a court order without thereby implying that the courts must, in order to carry out their mandate, run the schools. If they find the financing system improper they cannot properly order the Legislature to raise taxes. This latter difficulty involves \"the inherent limitations of the judicial process, arising especially from its largely negative character and limited resources for enforcement.\" Rescue Army v. Municipal Court of Los Angeles, 331 U.S. 549, 571 (1947). Furthermore, where a facet of a given total problem is susceptible of court resolution, but such resolution aggravates, distorts, or intensifies the magnitude of other aspects of the total problem which must then be left for resolution by another branch of government, (the water balloon problem) there is a dangerous possibility of \"a court's undertaking independent resolution without expressing . . . the respect due coordinate branches of government.\" Baker v. Carr, supra at 217.\n\nThe courts' inability to resolve many public issues such as the one before us is compounded by the problem of interest representation. Public law litigation has wide impact and, therefore, seems to necessitate representation of all who will be affected by its resolution; however, no reliable criteria have yet been found for identifying the affected interest, \"apart from the decibel of the protest.\" Chayse, The Role of the Judge in Public Law Litigation, 89 Harv. L. Rev. 1281 at 1311 (1976). It should be obvious that the traditional adverseness necessary to \"[sharpen] the presentation of the issues\" envisaged by Baker v. Carr is absent when the named defendant is either in reality not adverse or, at the very least, ambivalent. This is obviously the case before us; certainly the State Treasurer, State Board of Education, and State Superintendent of Schools are all in favor of \"thorough and efficient\" education. The adverse party, if there be one, is the taxpayer who is not a named defendant and cannot even be effectively represented by naming the President of the Senate and Speaker of the House of Delegates.\n\nConsequently, it is with reluctance that I must Dissent from the opinion of my learned colleagues, not because I am less outraged than they about the condition of West Virginia schools, but because I am neither Governor nor the entire Legislature. On remand I would hope that the lower court does not confine itself to an investigation of the problem of school financing alone; the children are entitled to a better inquiry than that if the courts are going to get into the question. The lower court should investigate, as suggested in the majority opinion, the relationship of tenure without need to demonstrate continuing competence, salaries which are not based on performance, lack of consolidation, inferior curricula, poor discipline, and a host of other ingredients which comprise the total problem. Only after adequate development of all those problems will the issue of finance be capable of being placed in proper perspective.\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003e1.

The Texas school financing plan was attacked in Rodriguez on much the same theory as is done in this case. The claim was made that because a part of the total educational expenditure came from property taxes raised in each of the counties, a discriminatory class was created against those persons residing in school districts that had low property tax bases and even with an equalizing state aid formula had substantially less money per pupil than wealthy districts.\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003eThe Court 5-4 decided that education is not, from a federal standpoint, a fundamental right subject to strict scrutiny for equal protection deficiencies, and therefore that Texas was only required to show a rational basis for its educational funding system.

Debates and Proceedings of the First Constitutional Convention of West Virginia 1861-1863 [hereinafter Debates ] is particularly interesting because it reveals wisdom, foresight and perception which has proved amazingly accurate. There were lengthy dialogues, for example, about the merits of constitutionally requiring taxes on corporations to be devoted to schools -- debates during which out-of-State owner exploitation of the State's wealth was predicated by proponents, and the depressing effect of such taxes on attracting out-of-State capital was prophesied by opponents. The currency of the problem is illustrated in the series of newspaper articles by Tom D.

Our Court is one of the few we have found that on every occasion has not given extra weight to the education mandate, balanced against other constitutional rules. We have held that a constitutional prohibition against the State extending credit to local governments applied also to State payment of local school districts' bonds. Berry v. Fox, 114 W.Va. 513, 172 S.E. 896 (1934). The decision, by a divided court, was unfortunate. No authority about payment by the state of local school debts was cited. Instead, the majority wrote: \"The school houses, also, whether paid for from the proceeds of bonds or not, remain permanently for the use of the communities which brought them into being.\" [ Id. at 524, 172 S.E. at 901] Apparently the court was not apprised that local district debts were state responsibilities because the districts themselves were agencies of the State, and doing the State's work when they incurred the debts.

See W.Va. Code, 18-9A-12. There may be some problem if, on remand, it is determined that Lincoln County is not utilizing the State Tax Commissioner's appraisement figures and the county court has not allocated to the county board of education, under W.Va. Code, 18-9A-11, the differential between the revenues that it would have received based on the Tax Commissioner's appraisal and the amount actually received on the lower appraisal. W.Va. Code, 18-9A-11, requires the State Board of Education to compute the county's property tax revenues for school purposes based on appraisement made by the State Tax Commissioner. It is this amount which is subtracted from the county's gross State foundation aid. Obviously, if the counties are not following the State Tax Commissioner's appraisal figures and the county court is not supplementing the difference, disparities arise between the actual tax revenues received for school purposes and the hypothetical figure used in the State foundation aid formula.

First, the hypothetical 'local share', which is deducted from the seven-factor computation of expenses used in determining state foundation aid is 17 percent less than the amount actually raised locally for education. This 17 percent is thus not considered in the state aid calculation. Second, the primary expense category for the state aid formula is the 'allowance for professional educators,' which category also determines to a large extent the expense allowances in categories 2, 3, 5 and 6. In property-poor counties the number of professional educators is less proportionately than in property-rich counties because of lack of classroom facilities and other physical resources. . . .\"\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003e37.

The patriots of this State were never afflicted with \"an Appalachian mentality that finds nobility in ignorance. . . .\" Leonard T.

Borden, 48 U.S. (7 How.) 1 (1849) to Gilligan v. Morgan, 413 U.S. 1 (1973). In Luther the Supreme Court was asked to recognize a rebel government of Rhode Island as opposed to the government established under the original colonial charter. The Court determined that they could not decide which state government was in power but that Congress had that power under the guaranty clause, U.S. Const. art. 4, § 4, which it had delegated to the President. The Court seemed to intimate that if Congress possessed the power then the judiciary did not since it involved a question not susceptible to conflicting answers. Other nineteenth century cases, Forsyth v. Hammond, 166 U.S. 506 (1897); Minor v. Happersett, 88 U.S. (21 Wall.) 162 (1875) arose under the guaranty clause and followed Luther's lead to the extent of denying relief but recognized that the guaranty clause could be applied to protect individual rights. However, in Pacific States Tel. \u0026 Tel. Co. v. Oregon, 223 U.S. 118 (1912), the Supreme Court held that the question of whether a state government is \"republican\" was not capable of judicial resolution; the guaranty clause did not yield itself to judicial power since that would \"obliterate the division between judicial authority and legislative power . . .\" 223 U.S. at 142. At that point it seemed that the constitutional provision relied on determined justiciability but that approach was abandoned by the plurality in Colegrove v. Green, 328 U.S. 549 (1946) where the Court held it could not reapportion voting districts by itself reasoning that the Constitution plainly granted the questioned power to Congress and \"Courts ought not to enter this political thicket.\" 328 U.S. at 556. This analysis was decisively rejected in Baker v. Carr, 369 U.S. 186 (1962) where the Court clarified the doctrine as one of \"political questions\" not \"political cases.\" 369 U.S. at 217. The Court returned to the traditional question of whether the constitutional provision invoked was susceptible to translation into judicially enforceable rights. Other political question cases, Coleman v. Miller, 307 U.S. 433 (1939); Chicago \u0026 S. Air Lines v. Waterman S.S. Corp., 333 U.S. 103 (1948), evidenced the enforcement problem. Decisions since Baker v. Carr, United States v. Nixon, 418 U.S. 683 (1974); Powell v. McCormack, 395 U.S. 486 (1969), have remained true to its doctrine of enforceable rights, manageable standards, and constitutional commitment, but only one, Gilligan v. Morgan, 413 U.S. 1 (1973) (14th Amendment challenge to the training of the Ohio National Guard), has invoked the political question doctrine to hold an issue nonjusticiable reasoning that \"it is difficult to conceive of an area of governmental activity in which the courts have less competence . . . [than] professional military judgments, subject always to civilian control of the Legislative and Executive Branches. 413 U.S. at 10. Thus the political question doctrine evolved, not as an off-limits sign on certain constitutional provisions, but as a requirement that courts consider whether manageable judicial standards can be developed in order to make certain rights judicially enforceable.\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003e2 Under W.Va. Code, 18A-2-2 [1969], a teacher's contract with the county board of education becomes \"continuing\" after three years of employment and can be canceled only in one of two ways: (1) by the teacher's written resignation or (2) by majority vote of the full membership of the school board for cause. If cancellation is by vote of the school board, the teacher must be given an opportunity to be heard prior to cancellation and if cancellation is improper (not sufficient cause) the board can be subjected to monetary claims. Mason County Board of Education v. State Superintendent of Schools, W.Va. , 234 S.E.2d 321 (1977). See also W.Va. Code, 18A-2-8 [1969] (dismissal of school personnel); W.Va. Code, 18A-3-1 [1969] (teacher certification); W.Va. Code, 18A-3-3 [1969] (permanent certification); and W.Va. Code, 18A-4-2 [1977] and W.Va. Code, 18A-4-2a [1977] (state minimum and supplemental salaries based exclusively on years experience and educational training without consideration of competency or quality of training).\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003e3 While justiciability is generally considered a question of law preliminary to judicial intervention, commentators are increasingly recognizing a fact-finding element in the determination of justiciability. The issue, arising predominantly in public law litigation, does not involve \"adjudicative\" fact-finding envisaged in the traditional private dispute resolution function of the courts, but rather involves \"legislative\" fact-finding necessary to assess and appraise the viability of alternative resolutions. While usual private party litigation is primarily concerned with assessing past conduct (adjudicative facts), public law litigation is concerned with prospective conduct (legislative facts) which must be ascertained before the \"judicially discoverable and manageable standards\" test of Baker v. Carr can be met. See generally Chayes, The Role of the Judge in Public Law Litigation, 89 Harv. L. Rev. 1281 (1976).\u003c/span\u003e\n\n",
