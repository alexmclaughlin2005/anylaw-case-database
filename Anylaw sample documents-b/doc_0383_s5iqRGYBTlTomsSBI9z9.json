    "body": "MEMORANDUM OPINION\n\nIn these consolidated reapportionment cases, three groups ofplaintiffs challenge the validity, under the federal andIllinois constitutions and related law, of Illinois' 1981state legislative redistricting plan (the \"Commission Plan\").For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we reject theRybicki plaintiffs' allegations, on behalf of Republican andsuburban interests, of noncompactness, partisan unfairness andimpermissible fracturing of counties (and other politicalsubdivisions) and suburban communities. We accept, in part, theCrosby plaintiffs' claim, on behalf of black voters, that theCommission Plan unconstitutionally dilutes black votingstrength. As a remedy for this unconstitutional dilution of theblack vote, we adopt certain modifications to the CommissionPlan, identified as Court Exhibits 1A, 2A, 7D and 7E (andrelated documents). We also approve as fair, adequate andreasonable a Settlement Agreement reached between the DelValleplaintiffs, on behalf of Hispanic voters, and the Commissiondefendants, and therefore approve certain further modificationsto the Commission Plan, as stipulated in the SettlementAgreement.\n\nBackground\n\nThree groups of plaintiffs in these consolidated caseschallenge the redistricting plan adopted by the IllinoisLegislative Redistricting Commission (the \"Commission\") forthe election of candidates to the Illinois GeneralAssembly.\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e1\u003c/span\u003e Plaintiffs in Rybicki v. State Board ofElections, No. 81 C 6030, allege that the Commission Plan failsto accord suburban voters equal protection of the laws bydisproportionately concentrating voting power, and thereforelegislativerepresentation, in the City of Chicago. They also allege thatthe plan is politically unfair, contains numerous non-compactdistricts and indiscriminately fractures politicalsubdivisions. Plaintiffs in Crosby v. State Board of Elections,No. 81 C 6093, allege that the Commission Plan intentionallydiscriminates against black voters by diluting their votingstrength and providing white voters a disproportionateopportunity to elect candidates of their choice. Plaintiffs inDelValle v. State Board of Elections, No. 81 C 6052, allegethat the Commission's redistricting effort similarly dilutesthe voting power of Hispanics, thereby depriving them of areasonable opportunity to elect representatives of theirchoice. All three complaints charge that the Plan violates theFourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments to the United StatesConstitution, 42 U.S.C. § 1973 (1976), 42 U.S.C. § 1983 (1976),and Article I, § 2 and Article IV, § 3 of the 1970 IllinoisConstitution.\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e2\u003c/span\u003e Jurisdiction in each case is alleged under28 U.S.C. § 1343 (1976) and the principles of pendentjurisdiction.\n\nDefendants in all three cases are James Edgar, the Secretaryof State of Illinois, who is charged under Article IV, § 3 ofthe 1970 Illinois Constitution, with publication of thelegislative redistricting map; the Illinois State Board ofElections and its members who, pursuant to Ill.Rev.Stats. ch.46, § 1A-8 (1979), are primarily responsible for theadministration and supervision of elections in Illinois; andthe Illinois Legislative Redistricting Commission (and itsDemocratic members individually), which is charged pursuant toArticle IV, § 3 of the 1970 Illinois Constitution with the taskof promulgating a redistricting plan in the event that thelegislature fails to adopt such a plan.\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e3\u003c/span\u003e\n\nOn November 2, 1981, a three-judge court was convenedpursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2284(a) (1976) to hear these cases and,on November 23, all three cases were consolidated for expeditedconsideration. Trial was concluded on December 7, 1981, afterthe court had heard testimony from 25 witnesses and receivedinto evidence more than 200 exhibits.\n\nI. Facts\n\nA.  Procedural Background of the 1981 Legislature      Redistricting in Illinois\n\nArticle IV, § 3 of the 1970 Illinois Constitution requires aredistricting of the Illinois General Assembly in the yearfollowing each federal decennial census. The IllinoisConstitution provides the legislature with the firstopportunity to adopt a plan that redistricts all legislativeseats in the Illinois House and Senate in a manner such that anequal share of the population, under the most recent census,resides in each district.\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e4\u003c/span\u003e If the legislature does notadopt a plan by June 30 of the first year following the census,an eight-member Legislative Redistricting Commission must beformed. The Speaker and Minority Leader of the Illinois Houseand the President and Minority Leader of the Illinois Senateeach appoint two members to the Commission. The Commission maynot include more than four members from one political party normore than four members who hold seats in the General Assembly.The constitution further requires that the Commission completea plan by August 10 of the year it is convened. If theCommission fails to agreeon a plan, the Illinois Supreme Court provides the Secretaryof State with the names of two persons from differentpolitical parties, one of whom is chosen by lot to become theninth member of the Commission. The Commission then has untilOctober 5 to file a redistricting plan approved by a majorityof its members.\n\nIn view of the importance of legislative history to proof ofa claim of intentional discrimination,\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e5\u003c/span\u003e we set forth insome detail the background evidence of the redistrictingefforts of both the legislature and the Commission.\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e6\u003c/span\u003eDuring the first few months of 1981, the results of thefederal census were delivered to ranking Illinois legislativeand executive officials.\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e7\u003c/span\u003e Figures in hand, the leaders ofboth parties immediately engaged the services of consultantsto aid in both the development and political analysis of thepossible redistricting plans. The political data utilized byboth parties included voting results and patterns at thecensus tract level for a variety of legislative and state-wideraces run from 1978 through 1980.\n\nIn the course of their preparations, the Democratic staff,under the direction of House Minority Leader Michael Madigan,solicited the views of all Democratic legislators. A number ofblack legislators told Madigan that blacks wereunderrepresented both in the legislature as a whole and in theparty caucuses. A House Select Committee on Reapportionmentalso conducted public hearings to solicit the views ofcitizens in general. The Committee was advised at thesehearings in Chicago of the desire of the black community forgreater representation in the legislature.\n\nBy May, 1981, Republican legislators had created a planwhich they introduced in the Illinois House. The Democrats hadalso succeeded in developing a plan which they submitted tothe state Senate.\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e8\u003c/span\u003e A major impediment to passage of bothplans, however, was Madigan's fear that Governor Thompson, aRepublican, would exercise his amendatory veto with respect toany plan presented to him. Consequently, neither plan passedand, in July, the Legislative Redistricting Commission wasformed.\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e9\u003c/span\u003e\n\nBefore making his appointments, Madigan circulated amongHouse Democrats a form requesting that they submit theirrecommendations for potential Commission appointees. Madiganstated that he had committed himself to the appointment of onemember from a racial or ethnic minority. Although most of theblack legislators recommended the appointment of Rep. EmilJones, currently an Assistant Minority Leader, Madiganfollowed the advice of other black legislators, two of whomare plaintiffs in this case, and appointed a former StateRepresentative and black community leader, Corneal A. Davis.Apart from Davis, there was no black or Hispanicrepresentation on the Commission or on its staff.\n\nThe Democratic and Republican Commission members and theirstaffs worked separately and developed their own proposals. Onthe Democratic side, Madigan\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e10\u003c/span\u003e and Martin Murphy (who isthe Commissioner of Planning for the City of Chicago), workedon the Chicago and Cook County portions of their redistrictingplan. Rep. Michael McClain, a Madigan appointee,drew the map for the so-called \"collar counties\" (which arethose counties adjacent to Cook), while Senator JamesDonnewald busied himself with the downstate region.Commissioner Davis drew no district lines.\n\nThe Democratic Map\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e11\u003c/span\u003e for Chicago and Cook County, whichis the prototype for the map of those areas ultimately adoptedby the Commission, was drawn according to a systematicprocedure. The drafters began with the districts as theyappeared in the 1971 redistricting map.\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e12\u003c/span\u003e They intended toenlarge those districts that had lost population and shrinkthose that had gained. Throughout the process, Madigansolicited the views of all legislators, including blacklegislators, concerning various aspects of the map. The mapwas completed in rough form by the end of June. AlthoughMadigan testified that he made no attempt to hide the CookCounty map from various black legislators and communityleaders and Hispanics, only Commissioner Davis had theopportunity to study the entire Chicago and Cook Countyportions of the map at this stage or at any time prior to itsadoption as the Commission Plan on October 2, 1981.\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e13\u003c/span\u003e\n\nNotwithstanding the fact that the Democrats had completeddrafting the major portions of their map, the Commission heldpublic hearings in Chicago on July 23, 1981, to obtain publicsuggestions for redistricting. A number of witnesses,including representatives of the black and Hispaniccommunities, presented their views on redistricting at thesehearings. Several black witnesses testified that in the pastblacks had fared poorly in the redistricting process; thatpercentage-wise the black population had increased in relationto the white population in Chicago between 1970 and 1980; andthat any redistricting should accord blacks greaterrepresentation. The Hispanics pointed out that they had norepresentation in the General Assembly and urgently requestedan opportunity to secure such representation. See Plaintiffs'Ex. 52.\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e14\u003c/span\u003e\n\nAmong the other witnesses who testified at the hearings wererepresentatives of the villages of Oak Park and Evanston, aswell as the Chicago neighborhood of Hyde Park. Thesecommunities, which had been fractured by prior redistricting,all requested that each be included in only one district.Although the protestations of black witnesses produced nochanges in the draft plan, the drafters did revise the plan toaccommodate the desires of these three geographicalcommunities.\n\nUnfortunately, the work of the eight-member Commission wasdoomed to failure from the start since neither side waswilling seriously to negotiate with the other over variousaspects of their respectiveplans. Whether this was due to the lack of mutual trust thatpermeated the legislative attempts at redistricting, theintransigence of both sides with respect to particularredistricting issues, the unwillingness of anyone to assumeresponsibility for a compromise or the Republicans'willingness to gamble on winning the draw for the ninth memberis difficult to say. In any event, both sides stuck to theirguns and, on August 9, the Democratic and Republican membersof the Commission presented their respective plans forapproval. With each side perceiving adverse political effectsfrom the plan of the other side, the eight Commission memberssplit along party lines on both proposals.\n\nPursuant to the constitutional procedure (of drawing bylot), former Governor Samuel Shapiro, a Democrat, was thenselected to become the ninth member of the Commission onSeptember 2, 1981. Governor Shapiro unsuccessfully urged acompromise between the Republican and Democratic Commissionmembers before he ultimately acceded to the Democraticproposal.\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e15\u003c/span\u003e On October 2 the Commission met to vote onwhat had then become known as the \"Shapiro Plan.\"\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e16\u003c/span\u003e TheRepublican Commissioners, now comprising an unenviableminority of four, criticized the plan as being unduly partisanand having a discriminatory impact on minorities in Chicago.Plaintiffs' Ex. 39 at 39-42. The Shapiro Plan was adopted bya vote of five to four, and it was officially filed with theIllinois Secretary of State on October 5, 1981.\n\nB. General Considerations\n\nWe briefly describe the more salient features of theCommission Plan, together with an overview of the demographicsof the State of Illinois before turning in detail to theevidence presented by the challengers and defenders of thePlan at trial. With respect to general characteristics, thePlan divides the State into 59 Senate districts, each of whichis in turn divided geographically into two Housedistricts.\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e17\u003c/span\u003e The ideal population for each Senate districtis 193,533. The total deviation of the Senate districts in theCommission Plan from this ideal is 1.59%, with an averagedeviation of .29%. The ideal population for each of the 118House districts is 96,767. The total deviation from this idealis 1.97%, with an average deviation of .42%.\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e18\u003c/span\u003e\n\nA better understanding of the details of the Commission Planand its impact on the plaintiffs in this case is facilitatedby reviewing the demography of Illinois and, in particular, ofmetropolitan Chicago. Evidence presented at trial indicatedthat Illinois may, for reapportionment purposes, be dividedinto three or four areas: (1) Chicago, (2) Cook County outsideChicago, (3) the five counties adjacent to Cook (the \"collarcounties\": DuPage, Kane, Will, McHenry and Lake), and (4) theremaining counties (i.e., the \"downstate counties\"). Of the11,418,000 residents of Illinois, the 1980 census reveals thatChicago accounts for 3,005,000 (28%), Cook County (includingChicago) for 5,253,000 (46%), the collar counties for 1,849,000(16%) and the downstate counties for 4,316,000 (38%). SeeDefendants' Ex. 121.\n\nChicago and Cook County constitute, of course, the largesturban and suburban center in Illinois. The collar counties aregenerally characterized as suburban and the downstate countiesas rural. The tripartite (or quadrapartite) division of thestate also generally correlates with political affiliation:Chicago is heavily Democratic while suburban Cook and thecollar counties are predominantly Republican, as are many ofthe downstate counties.\n\nOf the 5,253,190 residents of Cook County, 1,308,763 areblack (21.5%). Approximately 84% of the Cook County blackpopulation resides in Chicago, where the blacks comprisenearly 40%, of the city's total population. The blackpopulation of Chicago is concentrated in two areas. Thelargest concentration is found in the South and Southeasternportions of Chicago, extending roughly from the city-center\"Loop\" area to Chicago's southernmost boundary. This area is,for the most part, over 85% black and it contains 792,000, or66.2%, of the city's blacks. The area in question is commonlyreferred to as the South Side and is so denominated in thisopinion. A smaller concentration of blacks exists in the WestCentral portion of Chicago, centered in the Austinneighborhood. It too is over 85% black and containsapproximately 300,000 blacks or 23%, of Chicago's blackpopulation. This area has been frequently denominated the WestSide in this litigation and is referred to as such in thisopinion. Blacks also constitute a significant percentage ofthe population in and around the southern suburbanmunicipalities of Harvey, Robbins and Markham. Theconcentration of blacks in this area of Cook County is not ashigh as on the South and West Sides, but it ranges from 35% toover 85%. The total black population in this area — 46,000 — isalso relatively small. This southern area where blacks areconcentrated has been denominated the South Suburban area.\n\nA substantial Hispanic\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e19\u003c/span\u003e population also resides inIllinois. The majority of Hispanics live in Chicago, wherethey number 422,061, or approximately 14% of the city'spopulation. In general, the Hispanic population is not ashighly concentrated as the black population. The Hispanicpopulation is more dispersed than the black population, withHispanics residing in various areas throughout Chicago.Notwithstanding this general dispersal, at least two majorHispanic aggregations are easily identified in Chicago, one onthe Northwest Side and the other on the Southwest Side.\n\nC. Evidence Adduced at Trial\n\n1. The Rybicki Plaintiffs\n\nThe Rybicki plaintiffs submitted various testimonial anddocumentary evidence to support their claims of suburban votedilution, lack of compactness of certain districts, excessivefracturing of political subdivisions and political unfairness.\n\nSuburban Vote Dilution. The Rybicki plaintiffs argued that,based on changes inpopulation between 1970 and 1980,\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e20\u003c/span\u003e the collar countiesare \"entitled\" to more and Chicago is \"entitled\" to fewerlegislative districts than were accorded to these areas underthe Commission Plan.\n\nUnder the 1971 redistricting plan, Chicago votersconstituted part of the population in 20 Senate districts.Defendants' Ex. 12. Plaintiffs argue that in proportion to theCity's 1980 population, the voters of Chicago should controlor constitute a majority in 31 House districts and only 15.5Senate districts. However, under the Commission Plan, Chicagovoters \"control\" 35 House districts and 17 Senatedistricts.\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e21\u003c/span\u003e\n\nPlaintiffs similarly observe that the number of districtscontrolled by collar county voters has not increased between1970 and 1980, despite the population shifts from Chicago andCook County to the collar counties evident in the 1980 census.Under the 1971 plan there were six Senate districts (thenreferred to as \"Legislative\" districts) entirely within thecollar counties and five that overlapped into adjacentcounties. Under the Commission plan, there are still sixSenate districts wholly within the collar counties, but thenumber of overlap districts has increased to nine.\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e22\u003c/span\u003e\n\nCompactness. The Rybicki plaintiffs allege that 15 Housedistricts and 2 Senate districts are not compact.\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e23\u003c/span\u003e Thenoncompactness of these districts is evident, according toplaintiffs, both under a visual analysis and as demonstrated bymathematical standards. In Schrage v. State Board of Elections,88 Ill.2d 87, 58 Ill.Dec. 451, 430 N.E.2d 483 (1981), theIllinois Supreme Court invalidated former Commission HouseDistrict 89, which extended 125 miles at its longest point andsix miles at its narrowest, a length to width ratio of roughly21:1. By comparison, Commission Senate District 19, the mostegregious district on plaintiffs' list, extends 36 miles at itslongest point and is two miles wide at its narrowest, a ratioof 18:1.\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e24\u003c/span\u003e\n\nDefendants sought to minimize the significance ofplaintiffs' compactness complaints by introducing examples ofoddly shaped districts from the court-approved 1971redistricting effort. See Defendants' Exs. 61 and 62. Moreover,the Commission's expert witness, Mr. Brace, testified that theirregular shapes appearing in the Commission Plan werenecessitated in some circumstances to comply with the low (1%)population deviation standard employed as a goal by theCommission. Mr. Brace also stated that the desire to achievesome other redistricting goals, such as respect for theintegrity of political subdivisions, communities of interest ornatural boundaries contributed to the irregularly shapeddistricts. Plaintiffs attempted torebut these arguments by presenting their own \"Coalition Plan\"which, they alleged, contained more compact districts.\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e25\u003c/span\u003eBut this alternative map also indicates the difficulty ofachieving uniform compactness. The Coalition Map was draftedutilizing a less stringent population deviationstandard;\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e26\u003c/span\u003e nonetheless, as Defendants' Exhibit 62demonstrates, even the Coalition Plan contains a number ofhighly irregular, elongated districts.\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e27\u003c/span\u003e\n\nPolitical Fairness. The Rybicki plaintiffs also assert thatthe presence of noncompact districts is evidence of theCommission's intent to preserve a disproportionate number ofDemocratic incumbents. Moreover, plaintiffs allege that theextensive use of \"overlap\" districts designed to maintain thepower of Chicago (and hence, the Democratic Party) byfracturing suburban areas, demonstrates the politicalunfairness of the Commission Plan. Defendants vigorously denythat the Commission Plan is politically unfair. Evidencesubmitted by the defendants indicated that historically,Illinois has been a \"swing state\" which elects Democrats andRepublicans in equal numbers to legislative and executiveoffices. See Defendants' Exs. 23 and 24. In this connection,defendants analyzed the political effects of their map byexamining past voting patterns for each census tract in everydistrict.\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e28\u003c/span\u003e On the basis of this analysis, defendantsconcluded that the Commission Plan would produce in the House39 \"firm\" and 5 \"soft\" Democratic districts; 41 \"firm\" and 10\"soft\" Republican districts; and 23 \"swing\" districts. In theSenate, it would produce 21 \"firm\" and no \"soft\" Democraticdistricts; 25 \"firm\" and 3 \"soft\" Republican districts; and 10\"swing\" districts. Defendants observed that this alignmentslightly favors the Republicans.\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e29\u003c/span\u003e\n\nFractured Counties. The Rybicki plaintiffs also introducedevidence demonstrating that the Commission Planindiscriminately fractures political subdivisions.Representative Lee Daniels of DuPage County testified at lengththat fracturing can produce undesirable political consequences,particularly when a legislator is charged with representingareas that have divergent political interests. RepresentativeDaniels pointed out that, even though Cook County and thecollar counties have seemingly antagonistic interests on issuesof transportation, taxation and education, nine Senatedistricts overlap between these two areas.\n\nWitnesses for the Commission agreed that the fracturing ofpolitical subdivisionswas not desirable; they disagreed, of course, as to how muchfracturing was tolerable. The 1971 redistricting plan split 29counties into two or more districts. Defendants' Ex. 75.Plaintiffs' evidence showed that the Commission Plan splits 48counties into two or more districts, resulting in 122 separatefractures. Cook County outside Chicago is fragmented into nineparts, DuPage County into eight and Will County into seven. Bycomparison, the Coalition Plan splits 35 counties, resultingin 72 separate fractures.\n\nFocusing more closely on the Chicago metropolitan area, wenote that in the 1971 plan, eleven Senate districts wereentirely within Chicago while nine overlapped into CookCounty.\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e30\u003c/span\u003e Two districts overlapped from Cook County intothe collar counties. See Defendants' Exs. 9, 10. Under theCommission Plan, eight Senate districts are wholly withinChicago, eleven overlap into Cook County and seven overlap fromCook County into the collar region.\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e31\u003c/span\u003e\n\nThe alleged political result of overlapping districts in themetropolitan Chicago area is that a disproportionate number ofseats are \"controlled\" by Chicago and Cook County voters.Defendant Commission members admitted at trial and in theirdepositions that they intended to achieve this result ofwidening the influence of Chicago voters.\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e32\u003c/span\u003e Defendantssuggest that, in the absence of overlapping districts in theChicago and Cook County area, a redistricting plan grosslyfavors the Republican Party.\n\n2. Crosby Plaintiffs\n\nThe Crosby plaintiffs introduced several types of evidenceattempting to establish that the Commission Plan was theproduct of purposeful discrimination to dilute black votingstrength and to unconstitutionally gerrymander districts inblack population areas. Their proof may be categorized asevidence of (1) retrogression; (2) \"packing\" and \"fracturing\"of the black population; (3) movements of large racialpopulations in certain areas to preserve the incumbencies ofwhite legislators; (4) \"admissions\" of certain Commissionmembers; and (5) prior instances of discrimination allegedlypracticed by the regular Democratic Party organization inChicago.\n\nRetrogression. The evidence showed that while the blackpopulation increased, both absolutely and especially inrelation to the white population in Chicago and Cook Countybetween 1970 and 1980,\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e33\u003c/span\u003e the number of districts whereblack voters had a \"meaningful\" opportunity to elect acandidate of their choice did not increase appropriately. Atthe time of the 1971 redistricting, blacks constituted amajority in five Chicago Senate districts (21, 22, 24, 26 and29). When the 1980 census figures are applied to the 1971lines, blacks constitute a majority in six Senate districts(the former five districts plus district 28). Under theCommission Plan, blacks will constitutea majority in only five of the Commission Senate Districts (9,12, 13, 16 and 17). Thus, although blacks increased inpopulation, both absolutely and especially in relation towhites in Chicago between 1970 and 1980, they hold a majorityin the same number of Senate districts as in 1971. Blacks arealso a majority in one less Senate district than would havebeen the case had the current redistricting not occurred.\n\nBy contrast, white representation in districts where Chicagovoters constitute at least part of the population has notdiminished significantly. Under the 1971 district lines asapplied to the 1980 census figures for districts wholly orpartially located within Chicago, whites constitute a majorityin 14 of the 19 Senate districts\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e34\u003c/span\u003e even though theyaccount for only 45.5% of the population in thosedistricts.\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e35\u003c/span\u003e The Commission Plan, under the 1980 censusfigures, results in whites being in the majority in 14 of19\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e36\u003c/span\u003e Senate districts wholly or partially located inChicago. Although the white population of the City of Chicagohas declined, the Commission Plan, which employs several moreoverlap districts than the 1971 plan, actually increased to51.1% the white population in these Chicago-area districts,thus explaining, in part at least, why 14 of 19 districts arestill populated by a majority of whites.\n\nPacking and Fracturing. Packing and fracturing are the termsused by plaintiffs in this lawsuit to describe two somewhatdifferent means of reducing the voting strength of ageographically unified minority group. Packing occurs when aminority group is concentrated into one or more districts sothat it constitutes an overwhelming majority in those districts(and part of its vote is \"wasted\"). Fracturing occurs when ageographically unified minority group is unnecessarily splitamong a number of districts.\n\nAll five of the majority black Senate districts located inChicago under the Commission Plan have black concentrations inexcess of 80% of the total district population.\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e37\u003c/span\u003e Theblack population is also highly concentrated in the 12 ChicagoHouse districts in which blacks constitute a majority althoughblack percentages in these districts are generally not as highas in the majority black Senate districts.\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e38\u003c/span\u003e\n\nPlaintiffs also contend that the packing on the West and, inparticular, on the South Side of Chicago was greatly furtheredby drawing district lines which correspond to the raciallysegregated housing patterns evident in these areas. This SouthSide \"wall,\" as plaintiffs refer to it, runs, for example,along the westernmost boundary of Commission House Districts23 (94.33%black), 24 (98.43% black), 31 (98.44% black) and 34 (73.37%black), and separates these districts from predominantly whiteCommission House Districts 21 (4.03% black), 22 (4.18% black),28 (9.27% black) and 29 (11.56% black).\n\nBoth fracturing and packing are allegedly evident in thevoting districts on the West Side. Of the 300,000 blacks whoreside on the West Side, approximately 160,000 reside inCommission House Districts 17 and 18, both of which are over80% black. The rest of the black population is distributedamong Commission House Districts 11, 19 and 20, which haveblack populations of 48%, 72% and 18%, respectively.\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e39\u003c/span\u003eDefendants, of course, presented various reasons not relatedto packing and fracturing for the existence of district linestracing racial boundaries on the South and West Sides, whichwill be discussed infra.\n\nDuring the course of this litigation, the Crosby plaintiffspresented several alternative plans that they claim would morefairly and equitably promote the interests of black voters inChicago. The Coalition Plan, which was offered as a completelypackaged alternative to the Commission Plan, contains districtswhich incorporate more white areas into black-controlleddistricts, thereby enhancing black voting strength. By creatingdistricts which overlap from black areas into neighboring whiteareas the Coalition Plan produces five Senate districts on theSouth Side with black populations ranging from 70% to 85%.(There are four majority black Senate districts on the SouthSide under the Commission Plan.) The Coalition Plan would alsoavoid alleged packing and fracturing of the black population onChicago's West Side, by creating two black Senate districts(with black populations of 66% and 84%) and four black Housedistricts (with black populations of 65%, 67%, 72% and 96%).(There is one black Senate district and three black Housedistricts in this area under the Commission Plan.)\n\nAfter trial was completed, another plan, denominated the\"Crosby Plan,\" was presented to the court as an offer ofproof. This plan reconfigures most of the Commission Senateand House districts located within Chicago and Cook County byallegedly reducing the coincidence of racial and electoralboundaries and increasing the number of districts in whichblacks constitute a majority of the population.\n\nMovements of Racial Populations To Preserve WhiteIncumbencies. Plaintiffs presented evidence of racialpopulation shifts in several districts, allegedly motivated bythe desire to preserve the incumbencies of various whitelegislators or potential white candidates on both the South andWest Sides. These districts included Commission Senate District14, where incumbent Senator Jeremiah Joyce resides, CommissionSenate District 18, where incumbent Senator Glenn Dawsonresides, and various West Side districts, particularlyCommission Senate District 8, home of Senator Philip Rock andCommission House District 15, which is part of Senate District8. A detailed analysis of these population movements, which weregard as very significant, is included in Section III infra.\n\nAlleged Admissions of Defendants. The drafters of theCommission Plan acknowledged that, at the time they drew theMap, they were aware of the relationship between legislativedistricts and racial demographics in the City of Chicago.Throughout the line drawing process, the drafters possessedcolor coded maps reflecting the location and the degree ofconcentration of blacks and Hispanics in metropolitan Chicago.Extensive population statistics reflecting the percentages ofminority groups as well as statistics showing their populationgrowth between 1970 and1980 were also available to the Commission.\n\nRepresentative Madigan who, together with CommissionerMurphy, drew the Chicago portion of the plan, stated that hestudied the maps and that he was aware of the percentages ofblacks placed in each district.\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e40\u003c/span\u003e Representative Madiganand Commissioner Murphy also testified that racial factors,including the existence of racial feeling antagonistic toblacks in some South and Southwest Side white communities,were taken into account in drawing the district boundaries.See Tr. at 1432 (remarks of Rep. Madigan); 1838-39 (remarks ofComm'r Murphy). Neither Madigan nor Murphy indicated, however,that any district lines were drawn for the purpose of dilutingblack voting strength.\n\nHistory of Civil Rights Violations in Chicago. To strengthenthe inference of intentional discrimination against blacks, theCrosby plaintiffs introduced evidence of past racialdiscrimination by the City of Chicago and, allegedly, by theCity's regular Democratic organization. In particular,plaintiffs pointed to several lawsuits involving the ChicagoPolice\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e41\u003c/span\u003e and Fire Departments,\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e42\u003c/span\u003e the Chicago HousingAuthority,\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e43\u003c/span\u003e and the Board of Education\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e44\u003c/span\u003e in which thecity defendants were either found to have discriminated againstblacks or entered into consent decrees which recognized theexistence of racial bias within the agency. Plaintiffs notedthat the heads of all three city agencies are appointed by theMayor (inevitably a Democrat). Plaintiffs also introducedevidence of the new Chicago ward map, which they asserted to bebiased, and which furnished a guide in some instances for thechallenged legislative redistricting.\n\nInterests of Blacks and Hispanics. Defendants introducedevidence indicating that the Democratic Party has stronglyespoused the cause of blacks in Illinois. They noted that theDemocratic Party has sponsored and passed civil rightslegislation, social welfare legislation and legislationproviding for bilingual education — all matters of specialconcern to blacks and Hispanics. Blacks in Illinois areoverwhelmingly Democratic.\n\n3. DelValle Plaintiffs.\n\nThe DelValle plaintiffs alleged that the Commission Planintentionally dilutes Hispanic voting strength by fracturingthe two largest Hispanic concentrations in Chicago amongseveral House and Senate districts. The evidence presented attrial revealed that Representative Madigan and CommissionerMurphy were aware of the dilutive impact of the relevantdistricts on the Hispanic community. The Commission witnessesjustified their choice of district lines by arguing that theCommission Plan accommodated projected migration patterns ofChicago Hispanics and, thus, that the challenged districts willeventually maximize Hispanic voting strength. As a result ofdirections from the court to the Commission and negotiationsbetween the Hispanic plaintiffs and the Commission defendants,a Settlement was reached between these parties on January 7,1982. The Hispanic plaintiffs believe that this SettlementAgreement provides Hispanics residing in both the Pilsen —Little Village (Mexican-American) area and the Humboldt Park —West Town (Puerto Rican) area a fair and reasonable (and, infact, the best achievable)opportunity to elect candidates of their choice to theIllinois General Assembly.\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e45\u003c/span\u003e\n\nII. Complaint of the Rybicki Plaintiffs: Compactness,      City-Suburban Overlap, and Political Fairness\n\nThe Rybicki plaintiffs allege that the Commission Planunlawfully discriminates against suburban voters in the Chicagoarea, that the Plan contains noncompact districts, thatpolitical subdivisions are unnecessarily fractured and that thePlan is not politically fair.\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e46\u003c/span\u003e We first consider theclaims of noncompactness under Illinois law before consideringthe claims of discrimination against suburban voters andpolitical fairness under the appropriate federal constitutionalstandards. We also consider fracturing of politicalsubdivisions under the appropriate law.\n\nA. Compactness\n\nArt. IV, § 3(a), Ill. Const. (1970), provides that\"[l]egislative districts shall be compact, contiguous andsubstantially equal in population.\"\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e47\u003c/span\u003e The substance of thisprovision was first incorporated into the Illinois Constitutionof 1870, and the drafters of the Illinois Constitution of 1970reincorporated the provision into the current constitution. See6 Record of Proceedings, Sixth Illinois ConstitutionalConvention, 1352-53 (1972). Although seldom interpreted by theIllinois courts, see, e.g., People ex rel. Woodyatt v.Thompson, 155 Ill. 451, 40 N.E. 307 (1895); People ex rel.Scott v. Grivetti, 50 Ill.2d 156, 277 N.E.2d 881 (1971) cert.denied, 407 U.S. 921, 92 S.Ct. 2460, 32 L.Ed.2d 806 (1972),this provision was most recently construed by the IllinoisSupreme Court in Schrage v. State Board of Elections, 88 Ill.2d 87,58 Ill.Dec. 451, 430 N.E.2d 483 (1981), a case arising outof the redistricting plan presently under challenge. InSchrage, the Illinois Supreme Court considered a challengeunder this provision to one representative district (the 89th)created by the Commission Plan. In the course of invalidatingthe Commission Plan with respect to this district (and,concomitantly, to the 90th representative district), the courtadopted an \"eyeball\" standard to determine if a given districtmet the compactness requirement:\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e48\u003c/span\u003e\n\nIt is possible to establish a mathematically  precise standard of compactness. . . . However,  we find it unnecessary to adopt such a procedure  in this case. Rather, we can rely on a visual  examination of the questioned district as other  courts have done. . . .\n\nA visual examination of Representative District  89 reveals a tortured, extremely elongated form  which is not compact in any sense. . . . Nor were  the plaintiffs able to advance any reason which  might possibly justify such a radical departure  from the constitutional requirement of  compactness in this case.\n\nSchrage, 88 Ill.2d at 98, 58 Ill.Dec. 451, 430 N.E.2d 483.\n\nPlaintiffs have directed our attention to numerous districtswhich allegedly lackcompactness.\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e49\u003c/span\u003e Several other witnesses identifieddistricts that, in their opinion, represented such shapes asa \"microscope\" or a \"Buddha\" and thus lacked compactness.Finally, plaintiffs have also directed our attention toexamples of legislative districts found to be noncompact incases other than Schrage but interpreting similar requirementsof compactness. See, e.g., Preisler v. Doherty, 365 Mo. 460,284 S.W.2d 427 (1955); State ex rel. Barrett v. Hitchcock, 241Mo. 433, 146 S.W. 40 (1912); In re Sherill, 188 N.Y. 185,81 N.E. 124 (1907).\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e50\u003c/span\u003e\n\nWe have examined the districts described by plaintiffs asnoncompact and conclude that under the principles articulatedin Schrage, none of the districts in the Commission Plan reveal\"a tortured, extremely elongated [or other] form which is notcompact in any sense.\" Schrage, 88 Ill.2d at 98, 58 Ill.Dec.451, 430 N.E.2d 483. In reaching this conclusion, we are, ofcourse, mindful that the compactness standard is recognized byIllinois as a means to \"improv[e] legislative representationthrough seeking to insure that districts are notgerrymandered,\" 6 Record of Proceedings, Sixth IllinoisConstitutional Convention 1353 (1972) (Report of theLegislative Comm.). Consistent with this goal, the IllinoisSupreme Court reemphasized in Schrage that the constitutionalcompactness standard cannot be ignored. Schrage, at 96, 58Ill.Dec. 451, 430 N.E.2d 483. We clearly recognize theimportance of the compactness standard not only becauseIllinois law and its interpretation by Illinois courts iscontrolling on this issue but also because we agree with theunderlying policies and ideals on which Schrage is based.Nevertheless, we are aware of the various difficulties involvedin drawing legislative districts and the constraints imposed bythe one- person, one-vote standard, the imperatives of censustract data, the desire to follow natural, ecological andpolitical boundaries, and the competing demands of incumbents,voters and the courts.\n\nBearing in mind these considerations, we note that no otherdistricts in the Commission Plan are as relatively noncompactas Commission House Districts 89 and 90 (before theirmodification by the Illinois Supreme Court inSchrage).\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e51\u003c/span\u003e Indeed, although plaintiffs identified manydistricts in the Commission Plan as noncompact, a quick perusalof the plaintiffs' alternative Coalition Plan reveals that itcontains districts also comparatively lacking in strictcompactness. This comparison with the Coalition Plan issignificant because it reveals the problems with compactnesswhich pervade many approaches to similar redistrictingproblems. Thus, we decline to invalidate the Commission Plan,or any of its individual districts, as lacking in compactnessin the sense required by the Illinois Constitution.\n\nB.  Fracturing Political Subdivision Boundaries, Overlap      Between Urban and Suburban Districts and Suburban Vote      Dilution\n\nPlaintiffs contend that the Commission Plan unduly fracturesor splits politicalsubdivisions in Illinois, especially counties.\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e52\u003c/span\u003e Bydrawing districts which \"overlap\" a county line, plaintiffsargue that the defendants violated their own criteria ofkeeping political subdivisions and their concomitantcommunities of interest intact within the same legislativedistrict.\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e53\u003c/span\u003e The most vehemently criticized fracturingnoted in the Commission Plan involves districts that \"overlap\"between the City of Chicago and Cook County. There was alsostrong criticism of the number of districts which \"overlap\"between Cook County and the \"collar\" counties.\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e54\u003c/span\u003e Accordingto the plaintiffs, the net effect of districts which overlapfrom Chicago into the suburbs is the impermissibleminimization of the voting strength of suburban residents (whoare predominantly Republican voters in contrast to thepredominantly Democratic voters residing in Chicago). Thisalleged minimization of suburban voting strength assertedlyviolates the Fourteenth Amendment's guarantee of equalprotection.\n\nAlthough they do not deny that their plan in fact fracturesmany political subdivisions, several Commission memberstestified that two of their guiding criteria in designingdistricts were to minimize the number of fractures and tomaintain communities of interest. Defendants argue that theCommission Plan does not unduly violate these redistrictingcriteria. Defendants also concede that they intentionallycreated districts that overlap between Chicago and surroundingareas in Cook County and between Cook County and the collarcounties. The bulk of the overlap districts between Chicagoand its suburbs were created, according to the Commissionmembers, by generally following the district lines from the1971 districting plan, with adjustments where necessary to addor subtract population to meet the population equalitystandard. Moreover, defendants concede that a major motivatingfactor for creating overlap districts was to enhance andmaximize the influence of Chicago, its voters and theDemocratic party in the General Assembly. We address first thequestion of alleged indiscriminate fracturing of politicalsubdivision boundaries before considering the claim ofsuburban vote dilution under the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\nPlaintiffs argue that the \"overlap\" district lines, as wellas other district lines which indiscriminately fracturemunicipal, township and county boundaries, impermissibly splitrecognized communities of interest by indiscriminatelyfracturing political subdivision boundaries. As evidence ofthis, plaintiffs point to various examples of allegeddivergence of interest between the residents of Chicago andsuburbanites, or between residents of one county (particularlyCook County) or of a group of counties and residents ofneighboring counties.\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e55\u003c/span\u003e Although this argument has someforce, plaintiffs have not cited any legal authority whichwould require (or authorize) us to invalidate the CommissionPlan on such a ground.\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e56\u003c/span\u003e In fact, the 1970 IllinoisConstitution did not reenact those provisions of the 1870Constitution that required districts outside Cook County to\"be bounded by county lines unless the population of anycounty entitled it to more than one representative district.\"Art. IV, § 7, Ill. Const., (1970) (repealed).\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e57\u003c/span\u003e Moreover,districts that overlap between Chicago and suburban Cook Countywere approved by the Illinois Supreme Court in People ex rel.Scott v. Grivetti, 50 Ill.2d 156, 277 N.E.2d 881, 888 (1971),cert. denied, 407 U.S. 921, 92 S.Ct. 2460, 32 L.Ed.2d 806(1972), and the Democratic Commission members relied on thatdecision when they drafted their plan. Cf. In re IllinoisCongressional Districts Reapportionment Cases, No. 81 C 3915,slip op. at 24-25 (N.D.Ill. Nov. 23, 1981), aff'd sub nom.McClory v. Otto, 454 U.S. 1130, 102 S.Ct. 985, 71 L.Ed.2d 284(1982) (approving Congressional redistricting that createsdistricts which overlap between Chicago and suburbs).\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e58\u003c/span\u003eThus, we are unwilling to condemn the Commission Plan merelybecause it fractures a number of political subdivision lines orcreates districts that overlap between Chicago and itssurrounding suburbs.\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e59\u003c/span\u003e\n\nThe Rybicki plaintiffs also allege that the Commission Plan'soverlapping Chicago/suburban districts impermissibly dilute thevotes of suburban residents. These overlap districts werecarefully designed, plaintiffs contend, so that most of themcontain a majority of Chicago residents.\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e60\u003c/span\u003e The votingstrength of the suburban residents of these districts isallegedly diluted because the districts are controlled by themajority Chicago voters and their politicalorganizations.\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e61\u003c/span\u003e\n\nAlthough this argument has appeal, we reject it for tworeasons — one grounded in policy, the other in theConstitution. The Rybicki plaintiffs' argument can be reducedto the simple proposition that the Commission intentionallyfailed to increase the number of \"suburban\" districts\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e62\u003c/span\u003eeven though Chicago lost population and the suburbs gainedpopulation during the 1970's. The Coalition Plan espoused bythe Rybicki plaintiffs would cure this alleged infirmity byreducing the number of overlap districts, thereby increasingthe number of districts located wholly outside Chicago. Thisshift would reduce the number of districts \"controlled\" byChicago voters. Of course, at the heart of the Rybickiplaintiffs' claim seems to be the concept that Chicago votersare the highly disciplined \"agents\" of that city's politicalinterests (including the interests of its dominant politicalorganizations) — and that these interests are in major partinimical to the interests of suburban voters. We think theremay be some reality to this concept although the record isquite uninformative on the subject in general. We also believethat the concept may exaggerate the submissiveness of Chicagovoters and the gross antagonism of City and suburban interests.It is not disputed that, on some questions, some residents ofChicago may support positions strongly in conflict with thosesupported by their suburban counterparts. But to extrapolatefrom this modest assumption to a rule that Chicago residentsmust be excluded from any district including suburban residentsis unsupported either by logic or by the record before us. Theextreme parochialism in legislative districting seeminglyespoused by the Rybicki plaintiffs is not required by law andhas some tendency to derogate the intelligence and independenceof the average modern voter. We think this approach may besomewhat more reflective of traditionally hallowed conceptsthan of current reality.\n\nOur conclusion is not at odds with the Constitution. TheRybicki plaintiffs argue that any dilution of the votes ofsuburban residents by their inclusion in a Chicago majoritydistrict violates the Equal Protection Clause of the FourteenthAmendment. Although acknowledging that no clearly appositeSupreme Court (or even lower court) precedent directly supportsthis assertion, the plaintiffs argue that the Court hasrecognized that, in addition to racial or ethnic minorities,political groups of any nature may also assert a claim ofunconstitutionalvote dilution.\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e63\u003c/span\u003e We decline to give the dicta or separateopinions cited by plaintiffs such an authoritativeinterpretation, especially in light of refusals by the SupremeCourt to accord to political or other identifiable groups thesame Fourteenth Amendment protections in the electoral contextas are accorded to racial and ethnic minorities. As JusticeWhite, writing for the majority, explained in Whitcomb v.Chavis, 403 U.S. 124, 91 S.Ct. 1858, 29 L.Ed.2d 363 (1971):\n\nThe District Court's holding, although on the  facts of this case limited to guaranteeing one  racial group representation, is not easily  contained. It is expressive of the more general  proposition that any group with distinctive  interests must be represented in legislative  halls if it is numerous enough to command at  least one seat and represents a majority living  in an area sufficiently compact to constitute a  single-member district. This approach would make  it difficult to reject claims of Democrats,  Republicans, or members of any political  organization in Marion County who live in what  would be safe districts in a single-member  district system but who in one year or another,  or year after year, are submerged in a one-sided  multi-member district vote. There are also union  oriented workers, the university community,  religious or ethnic groups occupying identifiable  areas of our heterogeneous cities and urban  areas.\n\n403 U.S. at 156, 91 S.Ct. at 1875-76 (footnotes omitted).Accord, City of Mobile v.

Political Fairness\n\nA great deal of testimony was introduced at trial about the\"political fairness\" of the Commission Plan (and the CoalitionPlan as well). The Rybicki plaintiffs argue that \"[u]nder theguise of political fairness, the Democratic Commission membershave drawn a map which sacrifices compactness and the integrityof political subdivisions for the preservation of incumbency.\"Rybicki Post Trial Brief at 26. We have already concluded thatthe Commission Plan neither lacks compactness nor impermissiblyignores the integrity of political subdivisions. We nowconclude that what the Rybicki plaintiffs call the Commission's\"overt political gerrymandering,\" Rybicki Post Trial Briefat 27, similarly does not require us to invalidate theCommission Plan.\n\nAs a prerequisite to our consideration of this issue, wenote that partisan politically-based challenges toredistricting and reapportionment may be nonjusticiable.See WMCA, Inc. v. Lomenzo, 382 U.S. 4, 86 S.Ct. 74, 15 L.Ed.2d2 (per curiam), aff'g 238 F. Supp. 916 (S.D.N.Y. 1965); Cousinsv. City Council of Chicago, 466 F.2d 830, 844-45 (7th Cir.),cert. denied, 409 U.S. 893, 93 S.Ct. 85, 34 L.Ed.2d 181 (1972).Although plaintiffs seem ambivalent in their approach topolitical end- result as a test of fairness, they do contendthat the Democratic-controlled Commission improperly designeddistricts to maximize the number of Democrats likely to beelected to the Illinois General Assembly. Nevertheless, weconsider the political fairness issue here because it isinexorably linked to the questions of compactness and theintegrity of political subdivision boundaries, see Wendler v.Stone, 350 F. Supp. 838, 841 (S.D.Fla. 1972) (Roettger, J.,dissenting), and because the fairness question may require usto interpret the Court's decision in Gaffney v. Cummings,412 U.S. 735, 93 S.Ct. 2321, 37 L.Ed.2d 298 (1973).\n\nPlaintiffs' political fairness argument is premised upon theassertion that the Commission members, although claiming tohave created a districting plan that fairly represents thebalance between Republican and Democratic political strengthin Illinois, purposefully designed districts that maximizedDemocratic voting strength while minimizing and fracturingRepublican voting power. Plaintiffs also assert that theCommission purposefully \"gerrymandered\" districts \"to enhancethe ability of Democratic incumbents . . . to get reelected.\"Rybicki Post Trial Brief at 27.\n\nAside from the questions of detailed techniques, such as thealleged creation of noncompact districts and the dilution ofthe suburban vote (which we have discussed, supra), plaintiffsapparently assert the broader proposition that the end-resultof these efforts — an overall bias toward a Democraticlegislature — is constitutionally impermissible. We note,however, that the Rybicki plaintiffs never presented evidenceof what result in detail they expected from the Commission Map.The Commission, on the other hand, did adduce such evidence.\n\nWe believe that plaintiffs' argument with respect to thefairness of political result misconstrues the Supreme Court'sdecision in Gaffney v. Cummings, 412 U.S. 735, 93 S.Ct. 2321,37 L.Ed.2d 298 (1973). In Gaffney, a state redistricting planwas consciously designed, in \"the spirit of `politicalfairness,'\" to \"achieve a rough approximation of the statewidepolitical strengths of the Democratic and Republican Parties.\"412 U.S. at 752, 93 S.Ct. at 2331. The challengers in Gaffneycontended, however, that the plan was \"nothing less than agigantic political gerrymander, invidiously discriminatoryunder the Fourteenth Amendment.\" 412 U.S. at 752, 93 S.Ct. at2331 (footnote omitted).\n\nThe Court, in rejecting the challengers' claim, intimatedthat a plan, in order to pass muster, did not necessarily haveto be wholly \"politically fair\" in end-result or designed withtotal even-handedness to reflect the respective strengths ofpolitical parties in a state. Even a plan that reflected somepartisan leanings on the part of its drafters should not beinvalidated solely because the drafters of the plan indulgedsome partisan political biases. Based in part on Gaffney, we donot think it the function of the courts to attempt to totallydepoliticize a process so inherently political as districting.As Justice White, speaking for the majority in Gaffney,explained:\n\nWe are quite unconvinced that the  reapportionment plan offered by the three-member  Board violated the Fourteenth Amendment because  it attempted to reflect the relative strength of  the parties in locating and defining election  districts. It would be idle, we think, to contend  that any political consideration taken into account  in fashioning a reapportionment plan is sufficient  to invalidate it. Our cases indicate quite the  contrary. . . . The very essence of districting is  to produce a different — a more \"politically fair\"  — result than would be  reached with elections at large, in which the  winning party would take 100% of the legislative  seats. Politics and political considerations are  inseparable from districting and  apportionment. . . . The reality is that  districting inevitably has and is intended to have  substantial political consequences.\n\n412 U.S. at 752-53, 93 S.Ct. at 2331-32 (emphasis supplied).\n\nWe believe that the Gaffney decision in no sense mandates theinvalidation of the Commission Plan solely on the grounds thatCommission members considered partisan political advantage whendrafting the Plan.\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e64\u003c/span\u003e In any event the Commission presentedextensive evidence to demonstrate that its Plan, like the planapproved in Gaffney, would achieve a fair representation of thetwo major parties in Illinois based upon past election results.Indeed, under the Commission Plan, the Republican party maycontrol more relatively secure seats in the General Assemblythan the Democratic party.\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e65\u003c/span\u003e Cf. In re CongressionalDistricts Reapportionment Cases, No. 81 C 3915, slip op. at21-22 (N.D.Ill. Nov. 23, 1981), aff'd sub nom. McClory v.Otto, 454 U.S. 1130, 102 S.Ct. 985, 71 L.Ed.2d 284 (1982) (Ottoplan preferable because it approximates statewide politicalstrength of two major parties). The Court's admonition inGaffney is, we believe, equally applicable here: \"[J]udicialinterest should be at its lowest ebb when a State purportsfairly to allocate political power to the parties in accordancewith their voting strength and, within quite tolerable limits,succeeds in doing so.\" 412 U.S. at 754, 93 S.Ct. at 2332.\n\nNotwithstanding the asserted and apparent statewide balancebetween the two major parties achieved by the Plan, plaintiffsstill contend that the Commission Plan must fail because itwas intentionally designed to produce in end-result a maximumDemocratic party representation. This argument, however, doesnot, as we have suggested, rise to the level of aConstitutional contention. Although the Court inGaffney refused to abstain entirely from judicial scrutiny of astate redistricting plan motivated in part by politicalfactors, the Court expressly limited the permissible scope ofthe challenge to such a plan:\n\nWhat is done in so arranging for election, or to  achieve political ends or allocate political  power, is not wholly exempt from judicial  scrutiny under the Fourteenth Amendment. As we  have indicated, for example, multimember  districts may be vulnerable, if racial or  political groups have been fenced out of the  political process and their voting strength  invidiously minimized. Beyond this, we have not  ventured far or attempted the impossible task of  extirpating politics from what are the essentially  political processes of the sovereign States.\n\n412 U.S. at 754, 93 S.Ct. at 2332 (emphasis supplied)(citations omitted). It would be equally absurd for us toattempt to take the politics out of legislative redistricting.Plaintiffs do not assert, nor can they assert, that theDemocratic-controlled Commission attempted to fence out orinvidiously minimize Republican voting strength in Illinois.Similarly, we do not, in general, find fault with the effortsof DemocraticCommission members to protect incumbent Democraticlegislators. Indeed, the Supreme Court has expressly indicatedthat a redistricting plan is not per se invalid merely becausethe drafters considered the effect of district lines onincumbents of either party. See White v. Weiser, 412 U.S. 783,791, 93 S.Ct. 2348, 2352, 37 L.Ed.2d 335 (1973); Burns v.Richardson, 384 U.S. 73, 89 n. 16, 86 S.Ct. 1286, 1295 n. 16,16 L.Ed.2d 376 (1966).\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e66\u003c/span\u003e Plaintiffs have not persuaded usthat attempts by the Democratic-controlled Commission toprotect some of its members or other Democratic incumbentswould invidiously minimize Republican voting strength.\n\nIn sum, we do not believe that the role of courts inaddressing alleged unfairness to political parties isequivalent to their role in evaluating unfairness to racialand ethnic minorities. The major political parties (absent\"fencing out\" or invidious minimization) are presumed to havethe capacity to protect their own interests in the politicalprocess. The federal courts are not in business to compensatefor political errors, misfortunes or strokes of fate, whichmay leave political parties at some temporary disadvantage.The case for judicial action on behalf of blacks and Hispanicsis significantly different.\n\nWe conclude that the Commission Plan is not invalid becausethe Commission members considered (within limits) partisanadvantage when drawing district lines.\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e67\u003c/span\u003e\n\nIII.  Complaint of the Crosby Plaintiffs. Dilution of Black        Voting Strength\n\nThe Crosby plaintiffs have alleged that the Commissionunconstitutionally discriminated against black voters in thisredistricting by intentionally diluting their voting strengthand thereby denying them a fair electoral opportunity. Theseplaintiffs contend that the Commission Plan is a product ofracial gerrymandering designed to limit the participation ofblacks and Hispanics in the Illinois electoral process and toprotect various white incumbents whose districts have become,in the 1970-1980 period, heavily populated by blacks andHispanics.\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e68\u003c/span\u003e According to the Crosby plaintiffs, the whiteleaders of the Chicago Democratic organization purposefully setout to undermine the vote of the black electorate and weresuccessful in their efforts under the Commission Plan.\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e69\u003c/span\u003e\n\nA. Fifteenth Amendment and the Voting Rights Act\n\nFirst, we address the question whether, if proven,plaintiffs' claims of vote dilution are properly cognizableunder the Fifteenth as well as the Fourteenth Amendment.Although an answer to this question may not emerge withblinding clarity from the Supreme Court's recent decision inCity of Mobile v. Bolden, 446 U.S. 55, 100 S.Ct. 1490, 64L.Ed.2d 47(1980), we think that decision furnishes the mostauthoritative guide to the matter. In Bolden, the fourplurality justices (Justices Stewart, Burger, Powell andRehnquist), in considering the constitutionality of theat-large system of elections required by the commission form ofgovernment in Mobile, Alabama, held that the FifteenthAmendment \"prohibits only purposefully discriminatory denial orabridgment by government of the freedom to vote `on account ofrace, color, or previous condition of servitude,'\" and thatthis constitutional prohibition \"does not entail the right tohave Negro candidates elected.\" 446 U.S. at 65, 100 S.Ct. at1498. Relying on the district court's explicit finding \"thatNegroes in Mobile `register and vote without hindrance,'\" thefour-justice plurality held that both \"the District Court andthe Court of Appeals were in error in believing that theappellants invaded the protection of [the Fifteenth] Amendmentin the present case.\" 446 U.S. at 65, 100 S.Ct. at 1498.\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e70\u003c/span\u003eWe believe that under Bolden, plaintiffs' allegations of racialgerrymandering in the instant case, which do not implicate therights of minority group members to register and vote withouthindrance, but can only entail the asserted right to havecandidates favored by the protected groups elected, similarlyfail to invade the province of the Fifteenth Amendment.\n\nAccordingly, the black plaintiffs in this case cannotrecover under either the Fifteenth Amendment or under Section2 of the Voting Rights Act, 42 U.S.C. § 1973 (1976), which theBolden Court held to be equivalent in basic content and effectto the Fifteenth Amendment. City of Mobile v. Bolden, 446 U.S.at 60-61, 100 S.Ct. at 1495- 96; see McMillan v. EscambiaCounty, 638 F.2d 1239, 1242 n. 8 (5th Cir.), cert. dismissed,453 U.S. 946, 102 S.Ct. 17, 69 L.Ed.2d 1033 (1981).\n\nB. Fourteenth Amendment\n\nThe primary issue in this case is thus whether theCrosby plaintiffs' vote dilution claim entitles them to anyrelief under the Equal Protection Clause of the FourteenthAmendment. Bolden, of course, held that voting strengthdilution challenges to legislative apportionments \"couldviolate the Fourteenth Amendment if their purpose wereinvidiously to minimize or cancel out the voting potential ofracial or ethnic minorities.\" 446 U.S. at 66, 100 S.Ct. at1499.\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e71\u003c/span\u003e The Bolden Court went on to hold that, to sustain avoting strength dilution claim, a \"plaintiff must prove thatthe disputed plan was `conceived or operated as [a] purposefuldevic[e] to further racial . . . discrimination.'\" 446 U.S. at66, 1499 (quoting Whitcomb v. Chavis, 403 U.S. 124, 149, 91S.Ct. 1858, 1872, 29 L.Ed.2d 363(1971)). Thus, we must determine whether plaintiffs here havedemonstrated that the Commission Plan was purposefullydesigned to foster racial discrimination. Before we make thisdetermination, however, several preliminary questionsconcerning the nature of evidence acceptable to provepurposeful discrimination and the appropriate burdens of proofmust be addressed.\n\n1. Nature of Evidence and Burdens of Proof\n\nIn Bolden \"[t]here were five clear votes (Stewart, Burger,Powell, Rehnquist and Stevens, JJ.) against the propositionthat discriminatory impact alone is sufficient in vote dilutioncases.\" McMillan, 638 F.2d at 1243 (emphasis supplied). Inreaching this conclusion, the Bolden Court relied uponWashington v. Davis, 426 U.S. 229, 96 S.Ct. 2040, 48 L.Ed.2d597 (1976); Village of Arlington Heights v. MetropolitanHousing Development Corp., 429 U.S. 252, 97 S.Ct. 555, 50L.Ed.2d 450 (1977); and Personnel Administrator ofMassachusetts v. Feeney, 442 U.S. 256, 99 S.Ct. 2282, 60L.Ed.2d 870 (1979) as illustrative of the requirement that aplaintiff must demonstrate purposeful discrimination in orderto prevail under the Equal Protection Clause of the FourteenthAmendment. The Bolden plurality also relied on previouselectoral discrimination cases such as White v. Regester,412 U.S. 755, 93 S.Ct. 2332, 37 L.Ed.2d 314 (1973), and Whitcomb v.Chavis, 403 U.S. 124, 91 S.Ct. 1858, 29 L.Ed.2d 363 (1971), tosupport their discriminatory purpose rationale. We agree that adiscriminatory purpose must be shown in this case forplaintiffs to sustain a claim of racial vote dilution violativeof the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\nIn Village of Arlington Heights v. Metropolitan HousingDevelopment Corp., 429 U.S. 252, 266, 97 S.Ct. 555, 564, 50L.Ed.2d 450 (1977), the Court noted that \"[d]etermining whetherinvidious discriminatory purpose was a motivating factordemands a sensitive inquiry into such circumstantial and directevidence of intent as may be available.\" The Fifth Circuitrecently summarized the evidentiary sources alluded to inArlington Heights which are useful for assessing the existenceof purposeful discrimination as follows:\n\n(1) the historical background of the action,  particularly if a series of actions have been  taken for invidious purposes; (2) the specific  sequence of events leading up to the challenged  action; (3) any procedural departures from the  normal procedural sequence; (4) any substantive  departure from normal procedure, i.e., whether  factors normally considered important by the  decision-maker strongly favor a decision contrary  to the one reached; and (5) the legislative  history, especially where contemporary statements  by members of the decisionmaking body exist.\n\nMcMillan, 638 F.2d at 1243.\n\nThe Supreme Court's opinion in Arlington Heights alsodemonstrates that in order to establish a Fourteenth Amendmentviolation, a plaintiff need not prove that the challengedaction was motivated solely by a purpose to discriminate:\n\nRarely can it be said that a legislature or  administrative body operating under a broad  mandate made a decision motivated solely by a  single concern, or even that a particular purpose  was the \"dominant\" or \"primary\" one. In fact, it is  because legislators and administrators are properly  concerned with balancing numerous competing  considerations that courts refrain from reviewing  the merits of their decisions, absent a showing of  arbitrariness or irrationality. But racial  discrimination is not just another competing  consideration. When there is a proof that a  discriminatory purpose has been a motivating factor  in the decision, this judicial deference is no  longer justified.\n\nVillage of Arlington Heights v. Metropolitan HousingDevelopment Corp., 429 U.S. at 265-66, 97 S.Ct. at 563-64(emphasis supplied) (footnotes omitted).\n\nSimilarly, it seems clear that Bolden does not require thatthe purpose to discriminate be the only underlying purposefor the challenged redistricting decisions. The pluralityopinion in Bolden relied upon Arlington Heights and Davis forits interpretation of the Fourteenth Amendment, and asindicated above, Arlington Heights specifically rejects the\"sole purpose\" test. Justice Stevens' apparent contrary viewgarnered no support from other Justices.\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e72\u003c/span\u003e\n\nThe more challenging question is whether the analysis ofMt. Healthy City School District Board of Education v. Doyle,429 U.S. 274, 97 S.Ct. 568, 50 L.Ed.2d 471 (1977), isappropriately applied to mixed motive redistricting cases suchas the one at bar. Under the principles of Mt. Healthy (decidedthe same day as Arlington Heights), if plaintiffs are able toshow that a discriminatory purpose was one of the factors inthe redistricting, the burden shifts to the defendantCommissioners to demonstrate that the same redistricting wouldhave occurred even if a discriminatory purpose had notmotivated the Commissioners. In the case at bar, the Crosbyplaintiffs argue vigorously that the Mt. Healthy analysis isinappropriate while defendants, relying on Givhan v. WesternLine Consolidated School District, 439 U.S. 410, 99 S.Ct. 693,58 L.Ed.2d 619 (1979); Wren v. Jones, 635 F.2d 1277 (7th Cir.1980); and Nekolny v. Painter, 653 F.2d 1164 (7th Cir. 1981),as well as Mt. Healthy itself, argue with equal vigor that theMt. Healthy analysis applies.\n\nDefendants further contend that the applicable burden ofproof in voting dilution cases has been modified by theSupreme Court's recent decision in Texas Department ofCommunity Affairs v. Burdine, 450 U.S. 248, 101 S.Ct. 1089, 67L.Ed.2d 207 (1981). They argue that under Burdine, oncedefendant Commissioners have articulated a legitimate,non-discriminatory reason for the challenged redistrictingplan, the burden shifts back to plaintiffs to demonstrate thatdefendants' purported explanation is merely a pretext forintentional discrimination.\n\nWe agree that the principles of Mt. Healthy are applicable tothe instant case. The Supreme Court in Arlington Heightsexplicitly noted and approved the application of the Mt.Healthy burden of proof standard to race discrimination claims:\n\nProof that the decision by the Village was  motivated in part by a racially discriminatory  purpose would not necessarily have required  invalidation of the challenged decision. Such  proof would, however, have shifted to the Village  the burden of establishing that the same decision  would have resulted even had the impermissible  purpose not been considered. If this were  established, the complaining party in a case of  this kind no longer fairly could attribute the  injury complained of to improper consideration of  a discriminatory purpose. In such circumstances,  there would be no justification for judicial  interference with the challenged decision. But in  this case respondents failed to make the required  threshold showing. See Mt. Healthy City Board of  Education v. Doyle, post, [429 U.S.] p. 274 [97  S.Ct. 568, 50 L.Ed.2d 471].\n\n429 U.S. at 270-71 n. 21, 97 S.Ct. at 566 n. 21. And althoughArlington Heights is not itself a vote dilution case, itfurnishes a controlling precedent for intentionaldiscrimination as a necessary element of racial vote dilution.See City of Mobile v. Bolden, 446 U.S. at 66-68, 100 S.Ct. at1499-1500.\n\nApplying the Mt. Healthy analysis to the instant caseinvolves the following analytical steps. First, plaintiffs mustestablish a prima facie case of purposeful vote dilution underthe principles established in White v. Regester, ArlingtonHeights andBolden. Assuming that plaintiffs are able to make such a primafacie showing, the burden would then shift to the defendantCommissioners to establish that the redistricting in questionwould have occurred even absent the purpose to dilute minorityvoting strength. Thus, following the scheme of Wren v. Jones,635 F.2d 1277, 1285-86 (7th Cir. 1980), once plaintiffs havedemonstrated that racial discrimination substantiallyinfluenced the redistricting process, the defendantCommissioners must persuade the court, by a preponderance ofthe evidence, that they would have arrived at the samedecisions and adopted the same redistricting scheme even absentthe prohibited racial motivation.\n\nWe acknowledge that once plaintiffs have established aprima facie case, the Mt. Healthy analysis places upondefendants the heavy burden of demonstrating that the sameredistricting process would have occurred, even in the absenceof any prohibited motive. We also recognize that in the contextof very complex reapportionment decisions the discharge of sucha burden may be exceedingly difficult. But we also believe thatunder Bolden, establishment by plaintiffs of their prima faciecase is quite difficult. Therefore, we feel strongly that onceplaintiffs have sustained a prima facie claim, it is notunreasonable to shift to defendants the burden of showing thatthe same decision would have been reached even absent theinfluence of any discriminatory purpose.\n\nWe do not agree with the defendants' further contention thatthe three-part burden of proof test set forth in TexasDepartment of Community Affairs v. Burdine, 450 U.S. 248, 101S.Ct. 1089, 67 L.Ed.2d 207 (1981), is applicable to the instantcase. Burdine involved not a constitutional mixed-motivequestion, but a claim of disparate treatment under Title VII ofthe Civil Rights Act of 1964.\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e73\u003c/span\u003e The three-part burden ofproof analysis articulated in Burdine, although appropriate forascertaining the one \"true reason\" for a particularemployment-related action, does not deal with the problem ofevaluating mixed-motive decisions made by a multi-memberlegislative or administrative body. In the latter context,unlike in Burdine, the role of plaintiffs' prima facie case isnot to \"eliminate the most common nondiscriminatory reasons forthe plaintiff's rejection,\" 450 U.S. at 254, 101 S.Ct. at 1094,but to establish the influence of at least some impermissiblepurpose in the decision-making process. Once this has beenestablished, the judicial task becomes one of determiningwhether the relevant state actors would have arrived at thesame decision even absent the effect of that admittedlyimproper purpose. We believe that the two-part burden of prooftest articulated in Mt. Healthy and Arlington Heights, ratherthan the \"pretext\" analysis employed in Burdine, is mostappropriate to this task.\n\n2. Evidence of Purposeful Vote Dilution on Chicago's South                         and West Sides\n\nWith respect to the Crosby plaintiffs' claims, we believethat purposeful dilution of black voting strength, in severalsignificant instances, has been demonstrated in the instantcase. First, under the 1980 census as applied to the 1971Chicago area legislative redistricting lines, blacks constitutea majority in six Senate districts (former districts 21, 22,24, 26, 28 and 29). Under the 1980 census as applied to theCommission Plan, blacks will constitute a majority in only fiveChicago area Senate districts (Commission Senate Districts 9,12, 13, 16 and 17). This simple statistic is evidence ofretrogression\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e74\u003c/span\u003e from which a strong inference of a purposeto dilute maybe drawn.\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e75\u003c/span\u003e In addition, Dr. Amy Tsui, a sociologist anddemographer from the University of Chicago, testified that inher opinion, implementation of the Commission Plan wouldresult in a lessening — or retrogression — of the votingstrength in Senate districts presently held by Chicago areablacks under the 1971 redistricting plan.\n\nMore precise and identifiable indications of a purpose todilute may be found in the actions of the redistrictingCommissioners with respect to Senate Districts 14 and 18 ofthe Commission Plan. Under the Commission Plan, black votingstrength in former Senate District 28 under the 1971 districtboundaries has been fractured by the creation of CommissionSenate District 14, the district in which white incumbentSenator Jeremiah Joyce resides. Under 1970 census figures,District 28 was 73.8% white and 21.6% black. Under 1980 censusfigures, the black population of District 28 is now 106,830,making the district approximately 57.7% black and 39% white.To reach the ideal population for a Senate district, after the1980 census, present District 28 had to be increased byapproximately 8,000 persons.\n\nThe Commission, in the course of adding the necessary 8,000persons to District 28, removed 34,000 blacks from thatDistrict and added 42,000 whites, thereby reducing the blackpopulation percentage in the newly created Commission districtto 38%.\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e76\u003c/span\u003e The result of this shift in racial populations,apparently to preserve Senator Joyce's incumbency, was todilute the voting strength of the nearly 73,000 blacks whoremained in Commission Senate District 14 after the shift inpopulations. It may, of course, be argued that thismanipulation of racial populations in the district wasaccomplished for the purpose of maintaining the incumbency ofa white Senator and was not necessarily indicative of anintent to discriminate against blacks qua blacks. We believe,however, that under the peculiar circumstances of this case,the requirements of incumbency are so closely intertwined withthe need for racial dilution that an intent to maintain a safe,primarily white, district for Senator Joyce is virtuallycoterminous with a purpose to practice racial discrimination.Cf. McMillan v. Escambia County, 638 F.2d 1239, 1245 (5thCir.), cert. dismissed, 453 U.S. 946, 102 S.Ct. 17, 69 L.Ed.2d1033 (1981), (\"[T]he desire to retain one's incumbencyunaccompanied by other evidence ought not to be equated with anintent to discriminate against blacks qua blacks.\") (emphasissupplied).\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e77\u003c/span\u003e\n\nSimilarly, black voting strength in former Senate District30 under the 1971 district boundaries has been diluted in thecourse of creating Commission Senate District 18, the districtin which white incumbent Senator Glenn Dawson resides. Under1970 census figures, District 30 was 73.2% white and 26.1%black. Under 1980 census figures District 30 would be 46%white, 45.1% black and 8.9% Hispanic. Theblack population in District 30 is currently 85,997. To reachideal population for a Senate district, after the 1980 census,District 30 had to be increased by approximately 2,000persons.\n\nIn the course of adding the approximately 2,000 personsnecessary to bring District 30 to ideal population, theCommission increased the white population in what is nowCommission Senate District 18 by nearly 30,000 and decreasedthe black population by over 40,000 persons. Under theCommission Plan, Commission Senate District 18 will beapproximately 60.4% white, 23.4% black and 16.2% Hispanic. Thevoting strength of the 45,000 blacks left in Commission SenateDistrict 18 has thus been dissipated. As explained earlier, webelieve that these shifts in racial population, even ifundertaken for the immediate purpose of providing a safeSenate seat for white Senator Dawson, are so closely linked toa desire to minimize black voting strength that theyconstitute strong evidence of a discriminatory purpose.\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e78\u003c/span\u003e\n\nMuch of the black population that was formerly in thedistricts of Senators Joyce and Dawson has been moved into anew district, Commission Senate District 17, which replacesformer Senate District 29 under the 1971 redistricting plan.Former Senate District 29 was represented by black SenatorCharles Chew; he now resides in Commission Senate District 16together with black Senator James Taylor, and there is noincumbent Senator in District 17 under the Commission Plan.Blacks are unnecessarily concentrated in Commission SenateDistrict 17,\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e79\u003c/span\u003e and the resultant \"packing\" of black voteswastes such votes. See Beer v. United States, 425 U.S. 130, 154n. 12, 96 S.Ct. 1357, 1370 n. 12, 47 L.Ed.2d 629 (1976)(Marshall, J., dissenting) (\"Is it not as common for minoritiesto be gerrymandered into the same district as into separateones?\"); Nevett v. Sides, 571 F.2d 209, 219 (5th Cir. 1978),cert. denied, 446 U.S. 951, 100 S.Ct. 2916, 64 L.Ed.2d 807(1980) (\"compartmentalizing or fencing out a group\" constitutesunconstitutional gerrymandering). See also Note, ConstitutionalChallenges to Gerrymanders, 45 U.Chi.L.Rev. 845, 846 and n. 8(1978) (\"concentrating a voting block into one district ofnearly unanimous opinion . . . wastes\" the votes of thesupermajority). This unnecessary packing represents intentionaldilution of the black vote.\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e80\u003c/span\u003e\n\nAgain we believe that the immediate purpose of thesemovements of racial populations was primarily to preserve theincumbencies of two white Senators. But this process was sointimately intertwined with, and dependent on, racialdiscrimination and dilution of minority voting strength thatpurposeful dilution has been clearly demonstrated in theconstruction of Commission Senate Districts 14, 17 and18.\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e81\u003c/span\u003e\n\nOn Chicago's West Side there is also evidence of racial votedilution primarily with respect to the black population inCommission Senate District 8, and also to a degree in SenateDistricts 9 and 10. Black voting strength in former SenateDistrict 18 under the 1971 redistricting plan has beenfractured by the creation of Commission Senate District 8, inwhich white incumbent Senator Philip Rock resides. Under 1970census figures, former Senate District 18 was 90% white and9.2% black. Under 1980 census figures, the black population ofDistrict 18 is 68,763 or approximately 36.7% of the District'spopulation. To reach ideal population for a Senate Districtunder the Commission Plan, District 18 had to be increased byapproximately 6,000 persons. In the course of increasingformer District 18 by the required 6,000 persons, theCommission added nearly 56,000 whites to what is nowCommission Senate District 8, and removed over 51,000blacks.\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e82\u003c/span\u003e Commission Senate District 8 is now about 86%white, 9% black and 5% Hispanic.\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e83\u003c/span\u003e The black populationremoved from former Senate District 18 did not, of course,disappear into thin air. The Commission had to find a newdistrict for these blacks, and they found such a districtclose by — already heavily populated by blacks. Former SenateDistrict 21, represented by black Senator Earlean Collins,contained, under the 1980 census, a black majority of 79%. TheCommission redrew this district, now denominated SenateDistrict 9 under the Commission Plan, by including some of theblacks removed from former Senate District 18. This Commissiondrafting exercise resulted in a further packing of black votingstrength in Commission Senate District 9, increasing the blackpopulation to 81.4% of the district's total population. Some ofthose black voters whose votes were not wasted by being packedinto Senate District 9 found that they were now fractured fromthe rest of the black community by their inclusion inCommission House District 11 (48.3% black). The remainder wereincluded in Commission House District 19 (72.7% black).\n\nThe Commission also apparently succeeded in halting andreversing growing black voting strength in another Senatedistrict represented by white incumbents. Former SenateDistrict 19 under the 1970 district boundaries is representedby white Senator Edward Nedza. In 1980, the populationbreakdown in this district by race was 26% white, 35% blackand 39% Hispanic. The corresponding Commission Senate District6, in which white Senators Nezda and Steven Nash now live, hasan increased white population of 47% with a reduced blackpopulation of 24% and an Hispanic population of 29%.\n\nThe Commission points with some pride to Commission SenateDistrict 10, a \"majority minority\" district\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e84\u003c/span\u003e in whichwhite incumbent Senator John D'Arco resides, as evidence thatthe Commission did not dilute minority voting strength on theWest Side. Although the Commission did not substantially altereither the population percentages or the boundaries of thisdistrict, the Commission's actions with respect to District10 do not necessarily contradict the pattern of purposefulvote dilution at the expense of black citizens. TheCommission's own witnesses readily admitted that it wasunlikely that a black or Hispanic would be slated by theregular Democratic organization in this district. Hence, it isimprobable that a black or Hispanic candidate could win anelection against the white incumbent even though whitesaccount for only 20% of the district's population. The split\"majority minority\" simply could not be expected to elect acandidate from within its own ranks against anorganization-backed white incumbent.\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e85\u003c/span\u003e\n\nThus, 158,129 of the approximately 300,000 blacks residingin Chicago's West Side have been packed into Commission SenateDistrict 9 consisting of two concentrated Commission HouseDistricts 17 and 18. The remaining population has beenfractured, primarily among Commission House Districts 11, 15and 19. Under the Commission Plan, therefore, West Side blackswill have a decisive majority only in Senate CommissionDistrict 9 from which they will presumably be able to elect aSenator of their choice. They will have decisive majoritiesonly in House Districts 17, 18 and 19 from which they willpresumably be able to elect Representatives of their choice.The net effect of these racial population changes has been thepurposeful dilution of the black voting strength on the WestSide by at least one House District.\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e86\u003c/span\u003e\n\n3. Election Districts and Racially Segregated Housing                            Patterns\n\nPlaintiffs also argue strenuously that the boundary linesfor Commission House Districts 17 and 18 on the West Side andCommission House Districts 23, 24, 25, 31, 33 and 34 on theSouth Side trace in great measure the boundaries of the heavyblack concentrations in Chicago. They argue, inter alia, thatthese lines create a racially-defined \"wall\" around theresidentially-segregated black communities in Chicago, therebyappearing to confer an official governmental sanction on theresidential racial segregation which exists in Chicago.\n\nAt the outset, we reject plaintiffs suggestion that anyconsideration of racial factors in the districting processautomatically constitutes invidious discrimination under theFourteenth Amendment. The Supreme Court in United JewishOrganizations, Inc. v. Carey, 430 U.S. 144, 97 S.Ct. 996, 51L.Ed.2d 229 (1977) (\"UJO\") explicitly held that considerationof race in legislative apportionment did not constitute a perse violation of either the Fourteenth or the FifteenthAmendment. In UJO, a group of Hasidic Jews challenged a NewYork reapportionment plan which split the Hasidic communityamong several state legislative districts, on the ground thatracial considerations played a major role in the plan'sformulation and adoption. In upholding the plan, the SupremeCourt stated:\n\nContrary to petitioners' first argument, neither  the Fourteenth nor the Fifteenth Amendment  mandates any per se rule against using racial  factors in districting and apportionment. Nor is  petitioners' second argument valid. The permissible  use of racial criteria is not confined to  eliminating the effects of past discriminatory  districting or apportionment.\n\n430 U.S. at 161, 97 S.Ct. at 1007 (emphasis supplied).\n\nAlthough the Court's opinion in UJO relied in part on thefact that the New York plan was adopted in order to comply withthe non-dilution requirements of Section 5of the 1965 Voting Rights Act, at least five Justices agreedthat the challenged redistricting plan, and the explicitconsideration of race it embodied, would be valid \"[w]hetheror not the plan was authorized by or was in compliance with§ 5 of the Voting Rights Act.\" 430 U.S. at 165, 97 S.Ct. at1009 (Opinion of White, J., joined by Stevens, J. andRehnquist, J.). See also 430 U.S. at 179, 97 S.Ct. at 1016-17(Stewart, J., joined by Powell, J., concurring in thejudgment). As Justice White explained:\n\nIt is true that New York deliberately increased  the nonwhite majorities in certain districts in  order to enhance the opportunity for election of  nonwhite representatives from those districts.  Nevertheless, there was no fencing out of the  white population from participation in the  political processes of the county, and the plan  did not minimize or unfairly cancel out white  voting strength.\n\n430 U.S. at 165, 97 S.Ct. at 1010. Justice Stewart in hisconcurring opinion invoked a similar rationale:\n\nThe petitioners' contention is essentially that  racial awareness in legislative reapportionment  is unconstitutional per se. Acceptance of their  position would mark an egregious departure from the  way this Court has in the past analyzed the  constitutionality of claimed discrimination in  dealing with the elective franchise on the basis of  race.\n\nThe petitioners have made no showing that a  racial criterion was used as a basis for denying  them their right to vote, in contravention of the  Fifteenth Amendment. . . . They have made no  showing that the redistricting scheme was  employed as part of a \"contrivance to segregate\";  to minimize or cancel out the voting strength of  a minority class or interest; or otherwise to  impair or burden the opportunity of affected  persons to participate in the political process.\n\n430 U.S. at 179, 97 S.Ct. at 1017.\n\nThe Supreme Court's analysis in UJO indicates that plaintiffshere must do more than show that racial considerations haveplayed some role in the drawing of voting lines on the SouthSide. In addition, they must demonstrate that the state usedits redistricting authority as part of a \"contrivance tosegregate\" or that the challenged line or lines were designedto minimize or dilute the voting strength of minority voters.\n\nWith respect to the Crosby plaintiffs' vote dilution claims(which are the primary claims advanced in this case), the mostrelevant district lines are the lines drawn along the westernedge of areas that are 85% or more percent black on the SouthSide of Chicago. The challenged South Side district lines arepertinent here insofar as they arguably contribute to the\"packing\" of the black population. Plaintiffs' contention isthat black voters are \"packed\" into South Side Senate and Housedistricts, thus maintaining a situation where blacks comprise avery high percentage of the population in a number of thesedistricts. According to the \"packing\" theory, black votes are\"wasted\" to the extent that black population percentagesgreatly exceed the percentage — suggested to be 65% —\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e87\u003c/span\u003eneeded in voting districts to electblack candidates. Thus, the argument is that if the South Sidedistrict lines did not correspond so closely to blackresidential patterns, substantial white populations from suchareas as Bridgeport, Canaryville, Marquette Park and MarquetteManor could be included as minorities in the black-controlleddistricts, thereby increasing the power of black votes. TheCoalition Plan presented by the plaintiffs illustrates thispotential by creating more South Side districts in which thereis a substantial white minority but where the black percentageexceeds 65% — the percentage presumed adequate for control.Plaintiffs therefore argue that the South Side district linesmust be redrawn in order to alleviate \"packing\" and itsconcomitant vote dilution and, in effect, to increase blackvoting power by including a more substantial white populationbase in majority black districts.\n\nAs we have indicated, plaintiffs in this case mustdemonstrate purposeful vote dilution in order to prevail.City of Mobile v. Bolden, 446 U.S. 55, 100 S.Ct. 1519, 64L.Ed.2d 47 (1980). Moreover, we must be convinced, under theMt. Healthy standard, that different electoral boundary lineswould have been drawn in the absence of a discriminatorypurpose. We find that the evidence before us fails to establisha substantial purpose on the part of the defendants to dilutethe black vote on the South Side through \"packing\". Cf. CantonBranch, N.A.A.C.P. v. City of Canton, 472 F. Supp. 859, 868(S.D.Miss. 1978). Even had such a purpose been established,moreover, we think that defendants have demonstrated that theSouth Side districts would have been drawn as they were evenabsent any motive to dilute black voting strength. See Mt.Healthy City School District Board of Education v. Doyle,429 U.S. 274, 97 S.Ct. 568, 50 L.Ed.2d 471 (1977).\n\nDefendants explain the congruence of electoral and racialboundaries on bases other than those involving purposeful votedilution. For example, Representative Michael Madigan, whodrew the districts, testified that he actively considered theinterests of black Representatives in fashioning thechallenged South Side boundaries.\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e88\u003c/span\u003e In addition, a numberof black South Side legislators testified that the inclusionof neighboring white areas in their districts would place themin political peril and might lead to the nomination of a whitein the Democratic primary. Success in the Democratic primaryis tantamount to election in both the predominantly black andthe predominantly white districts in this area.\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e89\u003c/span\u003e Some ofthese black legislatorsalso testified to the difficulty or impossibility of theircampaigning effectively in adjacent white neighborhoods, andsome testified that they did not believe they couldeffectively represent white voters in adjacent areas.\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e90\u003c/span\u003eThe record also contains evidence of racial animosity in whiteareas such as Bridgeport and Canaryville, which are adjacentto the \"wall\" separating black and white residential areas onthe South Side.\n\nSome of these reasons, of course, recognize the existence ofracial animus or ill-feeling as a factor deterring theinclusion of white areas in highly-concentrated blackdistricts. But such recognition by no means establishes apurpose to dilute the black vote. Cf. Johnson v. Board ofEducation of Chicago, 604 F.2d 504 (7th Cir. 1979), vacated forpossible mootness, 449 U.S. 915, 101 S.Ct. 339, 66 L.Ed.2d 162(1980), opinion reinstated, 664 F.2d 1069 (7th Cir. 1981).Obviously, this court cannot and does not condone racialanimosity or ill-feeling between the races on the South Side ofChicago. But we think it our obligation to confine the presentinquiries to the issues of voting dilution which are the basisof the complaint in this case. It is true that the \"packing\" ofblack votes on the South Side in highly concentrated blackareas tends to \"waste\" the black vote. But it is also true thatconsiderably greater dilution of the black vote couldpresumably have been achieved by \"fracturing\" parts of theblack areas into minority fragments attached to neighboringwhite majority districts, so that the voters in these fragmentswould lose the opportunity to elect a candidate of theirchoice.\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e91\u003c/span\u003e\n\nAt certain points in this litigation, plaintiffs havesuggested that the drawing of district boundaries which trackracially segregated housing patterns tends to stigmatizeracial minorities and to infringe upon the associationalrights of minority voters. However, the record in this case isbarren of any indication that black voters on the South Sideare, or feel themselves to be, stigmatized by the challengedelectoral boundaries, or that such voters would prefer to beassociated, for voting purposes, with predominantly whiteneighborhoods such as Bridgeport and Canaryville. Indeed, theonly testimony offered at trial concerning the allegedlystigmatizing effects of South Side voting districts was thestatement of Representative Carol Moseley-Braun, a blacklegislator representing portions of Hyde Park and the SouthSide lakefront.\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e92\u003c/span\u003e While we acknowledge the importance ofRepresentative Braun's concerns, and have carefully consideredher testimony, we believe that in the particular context ofredistricting, the desirability of perfectly integrated votingdistricts must be balanced against the ability of blacks andother minority groups to elect candidates of their choice tothe relevant political bodies. In this regard, we note thatat-large voting systems, which theoretically offer the maximumdegree of integration, or \"color-blindness,\" are generallyregarded as disadvantageous to minorities and have beenrepeatedly attacked on the ground that they unconstitutionallydilute black voting strength.\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e93\u003c/span\u003e Our point here is not thatracial polarization and stigma are unimportant concerns, butmerely that in the particular context of legislativereapportionment, a purely color-blind (or integrationist)approach is likely to impede rather than enhance minorityparticipation and effectiveness in the political process.\n\nThere is thus little or no direct evidence in the record thatthe alleged South Side \"wall\" was drawn for the purpose ofdiluting black voting strength. Certainly, we find it moredifficult to infer such a purpose from the existence of theline than to infer such a purpose (as we have above) from themanipulation of racial populations in Commission SenateDistricts 9, 14, 17and 18.\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e94\u003c/span\u003e Moreover, it seems clear to us that thechallenged districts would have been drawn as they werewithout any reference to a purpose to dilute the black voteeven if such a purpose were presumed or proven. Nothing isbefore us to suggest that the challenged electoral boundariesare, in and of themselves, invidiously discriminatory. Apartfrom questions of dilution and so far as this recorddiscloses, a vote cast on the predominantly black South Side isprecisely equal in weight to one cast in Bridgeport.\n\nWe also note that any adverse impact of the South Sidedistrict lines from the point of view of voting dilution wouldnecessarily be felt by the black community as a whole in theCity of Chicago as a result of the \"wasting\" of votes whichwould otherwise be available to form additional black majoritydistricts. Such a dilutive effect is thus not specific toblacks living near the alleged \"wall,\" who in fact have theopportunity to vote for and elect candidates of their choice.Moreover, as suggested above, a more marked dilutive effect onthe black vote would have been achieved by running fingersfrom the white communities to the West into the concentratedblack area so as to fracture the black vote and, in effect,cancel it out in majority white districts. Such aconfiguration would no doubt suggest purposeful dilution ofthe black vote much more clearly than the existence of a linewhich tracks, in part, the division between predominantlyblack and predominantly white communities.\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e95\u003c/span\u003e\n\nIn addition to their vote dilution argument, we understandplaintiffs to contend that the South Side district linesrepresent illegal racial gerrymandering of the sort condemnedin Gomillion v. Lightfoot, 364 U.S. 339, 81 S.Ct. 125, 5L.Ed.2d 110 (1960). We recognize that allegations of racialgerrymandering present a suspect circumstance requiring closejudicial scrutiny, and that such gerrymandering, to the extentit exists, carries strong connotations of invidious racialdiscrimination. As the Supreme Court has repeatedly indicated,however, the gravamen of a racial gerrymandering claim is thedeliberate \"fencing out\" of a racial or ethnic minority — thatis, the exclusion or \"canceling out\" of such group's politicalinfluence in the relevant governmental unit. No suchexclusionary purpose or effect has been demonstrated in theinstant case.\n\nGomillion v. Lightfoot, 364 U.S. 339, 81 S.Ct. 125, 5 L.Ed.2d110 (1960) presents the paradigmatic example ofunconstitutional racial gerrymandering. In Gomillion, theAlabama legislature had redrawn the boundaries of the City ofTuskegee, altering its shape from a square to a \"strangelyirregular twenty-eight-sided figure.\" 364 U.S. at 341.Plaintiffs in Gomillion alleged that the redefined municipalboundaries eliminated all but four or five of the city's 400black voters without eliminating a single white voter. TheSupreme Court held that plaintiffs' allegations, if proven,clearly established invidious racial discrimination under theFifteenth Amendment.\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e96\u003c/span\u003eThe Supreme Court's holding relied heavily on the exclusionaryaspect of Alabama's boundary redrawing scheme:\n\nThe result of the Act is to deprive the Negro  petitioners discriminatorily of the benefits of  residence in Tuskegee, including, inter alia, the  right to vote in municipal elections.\n\nThese allegations, if proven would abundantly  establish that Act 140 was not an ordinary  geographic redistricting measure even within  familiar abuses of gerrymandering. If these  allegations upon a trial remained uncontradicted  or unqualified, the conclusion would be  irresistible, tantamount for all practical  purposes to a mathematical demonstration,  that the legislature is solely concerned with  segregating white and colored voters by fencing  Negro citizens out of town so as to deprive them of  their pre-existing municipal vote.\n\n364 U.S. at 341, 81 S.Ct. at 127 (emphasis supplied).\n\nIn Wright v. Rockefeller, 376 U.S. 52, 84 S.Ct. 603, 11L.Ed.2d 512 (1964), plaintiffs also alleged racialgerrymandering in the drawing of election districts. In theircomplaint, the Wright plaintiffs claimed that a New York statereapportionment statute, which divided Manhattan into fourelectoral districts, violated the Fourteenth and FifteenthAmendments by \"establish[ing] irrational, discriminatory andunequal Congressional Districts in the County of New York and[by] segregat[ing] eligible voters by race and place oforigin.\" 376 U.S. at 53, 84 S.Ct. at 604. Arguing before athree-judge district court, counsel for plaintiffs in Wrightfurther contended that the challenged redistricting schemepresented \"`a case of ghettoizing the Island of Manhattan' soas `to create a white Congressional district and a non-whiteCongressional district.'\" 376 U.S. at 54, 84 S.Ct. at 604.Despite these allegations, and despite the presentation ofconsiderable evidence indicating that racial factors had playedsome role in the redistricting process, both the three-judgedistrict court and the Supreme Court rejected plaintiffs'constitutional attack.\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e97\u003c/span\u003e The Supreme Court, in its opinion,expressly contrasted the invidious racial gerrymandering atissue in Gomillion v. Lightfoot, and emphasized the lack of anexclusionary motive behind the New York state redistrictingscheme:\n\nWe accept the District Court's finding that  appellants have not shown that the challenged  part of the New York Act was the product of a  state contrivance to segregate on the basis of  race or place of origin. That finding was crucial  to appellants' case as they presented it, and for  that reason their challenge cannot be sustained.\n\n376 U.S. at 58, 84 S.Ct. at 606.\n\nThe Supreme Court's decision in United Jewish Organizations,Inc. v. Carey, 430 U.S. 144, 97 S.Ct. 996, 51 L.Ed.2d 229(1977), also underscores the element of exclusion or \"cancelingout\" necessary to support a claim of unconstitutional racialgerrymandering. The Court in UJO held that a redistricting bodymay properly take race into account so long as itsredistricting plan does not \"slur or stigma[tize]\" any racialgroup, and does not \"fence out\" a racial or ethnic group fromthe political process, or \"minimize or unfairly cancel out\"that group's voting strength. 430 U.S. at 165, 97 S.Ct. at1009-10.\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e98\u003c/span\u003e Similarly,in Gaffney v. Cummings, 412 U.S. 735, 93 S.Ct. 2321, 37 L.Ed.2d298 (1973), the Supreme Court recognized that redistrictingplans may be vulnerable to constitutional attack \"if racial orpolitical groups have been fenced out of the politicalprocess,\" 412 U.S. at 754, 93 S.Ct. at 2332, or if districtlines have been used \"to minimize or cancel out the votingstrength of racial or political elements of the votingpopulation.\" 412 U.S. at 735, 93 S.Ct. at 2322 (quoting Fortsonv. Dorsey, 379 U.S. 433, 439, 85 S.Ct. 498, 501, 13 L.Ed.2d 401(1965)). Conversely, the Gaffney Court held that\n\n[C]ourts have [no] constitutional warrant to  invalidate a state plan, otherwise within  tolerable population limits, because it  undertakes, not to minimize or eliminate the  political strength of any group or party, but to  recognize it and, through districting, provide a  rough sort of proportional representation in the  legislative halls of the State.\n\n412 U.S. at 754, 93 S.Ct. at 2332. See also United JewishOrganizations, Inc. v. Carey, 430 U.S. at 168, 97 S.Ct. at1011.\n\nWe believe that the instant case presents a situation muchmore akin to that in Wright and UJO than to the situation inGomillion v. Lightfoot. Unlike the boundary adjustment inGomillion, the South Side redistricting at issue here was notdesigned to \"fence out\" blacks or to impede their participationin Chicago politics. Nor do the challenged district lines \"sluror stigmatize\" a racial minority. Moreover, as was the case inWright v. Rockefeller, black politicians representing theaffected districts have testified in support of the challengeddistrict lines and have expressed their discomfort withplaintiffs' proposed alternatives. See note 90 supra.Under these circumstances, we do not believe that the SouthSide redistricting represents either an unconstitutional racialgerrymander or an impermissible attempt to minimize or cancelout black voting strength.\n\nMoreover, we believe there is a fundamental tension betweenplaintiffs' apparent desire for color-blind redistricting onChicago's South Side, and the voting dilution theory whichlies at the heart of plaintiffs' constitutional challenge inthe instant case. Cf. Whitcomb v. Chavis, 403 U.S. 124, 156 n.34, 91 S.Ct. 1858, 1875 n. 34, 29 L.Ed.2d 363 (1971). Votingdilution claims, including this one, are premised at least inpart on the frankly race conscious theory of racial bloc voting— the idea that black voters will vote overwhelmingly for blackcandidates while white voters will support non-minoritycandidates. Indeed, the main focus of the Crosby plaintiffs'claims here is that there have been intentional efforts tominimize the impact of black bloc voting.\n\nWe thus find it difficult to accept plaintiffs' argumentthat the drawing of district lines which track, in somemeasure, the boundaries of racially identified communities istantamount to government sponsored segregation. The immediateeffect of the alleged districting \"wall\" in the instant caseis that black voters residing in the vicinity of the wall willhave the opportunity to vote for and elect candidates of theirchoice — precisely the opportunity sought in this case. Absenta showing of racial vote dilution or the fencing out ofminority voters, we do not believe black voters are beingdenied equal protection merely because their districts containfew white residents who may share the opportunity to vote forthe same legislative candidates. As we emphasized earlier,under the Commission Plan, a vote cast on the black South Sidehas precisely the same weight as a vote cast in Bridgeport. Wedo not foreclose the possibility that under some circumstances,the drawing of election district lines which track raciallysegregated housing patterns could amount tostate imposed segregation and thus constitute invidiousdiscrimination under the Fourteenth Amendment. See Gomillion v.Lightfoot, 364 U.S. 339, 81 S.Ct. 125, 5 L.Ed.2d 110 (1960);Wright v. Rockefeller, 376 U.S. 52, 59-62, 84 S.Ct. 603,606-08, 11 L.Ed.2d 512 (1964) (Douglas, J., dissenting). Wemerely hold that such circumstances have not been demonstratedin the instant case.\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e99\u003c/span\u003e\n\n4. Other Evidence of Racial Discrimination\n\nThe Crosby plaintiffs presented other, more general, evidencewhich they allege demonstrates a discriminatory purpose on thepart of the Commission. We have considered this evidence, assummarized below, but we do not find it dispositive inresolving the issues presented in this case. We think, however,that it is at least consistent with our findings and with theremedies we have provided.\n\nFirst, the plaintiffs directed the court's attention totheir alternative Coalition Plan. They suggest that theassertedly simple, compact districts of the Coalition Planprovide a more meaningful opportunity for black and Hispanicvoters to elect candidates of their choice than the \"strangeconfigurations\" characteristic of districts in the CommissionPlan. Although the existence of alternative patterns ofredistricting does not, standing alone, support an inferenceof discriminatory purpose, the Coalition Plan does demonstratethe feasibility of avoiding retrogression of black votingstrength through the creation of additional voting districtsin which blacks will have a meaningful opportunity to elect acandidate of their choice. The Coalition Plan is thus of some,albeit limited, probative value in establishing purposefuldilution of black voting strength in at least some of theCommission's districts. Cf. Cousins v. City Council of Chicago,466 F.2d 830, 843-44 (7th Cir.), cert. denied, 409 U.S. 893, 93S.Ct. 85, 34 L.Ed.2d 181 (1972).\n\nPlaintiffs also contend that the drafters' use ofanticipated ward boundaries in the City of Chicago, which arealleged to be discriminatory, tend to establish intentionalracial discrimination. Since ward boundaries have not beenadjudicated to be discriminatory, we cannot conclude that therelation of legislative lines to ward lines is any more thanmarginally relevant to racial dilution by the legislativeredistricting at this time. Moreover, alleged retrogression inthe wards (which we understand to be a plausible basis ofchallenge to them) does not necessarily infect legislativedistricts, since legislative district lines only partiallycorrespond to ward lines.\n\nPlaintiffs have also cited as evidence of purposefuldilution \"[t]he pattern of the racial discrimination in whichthe Democratic organization has long engaged in Cook County,through the Chicago Police Department, the Chicago HousingAuthority, the Chicago Board of Education, the Chicago PublicLibrary, and the Chicago Park District.\" Crosby Post TrialBrief at 3. Plaintiffs allege that the heads of each of thesegovernmental bodies is appointedby the Mayor (and requires the concurrence of the Chicago CityCouncil), and that these offices have long been controlled bythe Democratic organization. We recognize that employment orother discrimination has been alleged and/or proven in many ofthese City activities. We are also aware that racial prejudicecontinues to manifest itself throughout the City of Chicagoand in that City's Democratic organization, as well asthroughout many other leading organizations in Illinois andthe United States (including the courts). We believe thatthese perceptions are worthy of consideration in evaluatingthe issue of purposeful dilution of voting strength, and wehave considered them fully in making our assessment. Ananalysis of the relevant Supreme Court precedents, however,convinces us that such general evidence of discrimination, notdirectly related to electoral participation, is, in itself,insufficient to establish purposeful vote dilution under theFourteenth Amendment.\n\nIn City of Mobile v. Bolden 446 U.S. 55, 100 S.Ct. 1490, 64L.Ed.2d 47 (1980), the Supreme Court explicitly disapproved thedistrict court's reliance on racial discrimination in municipalemployment and in the dispensing of public services to supporta finding that the City's at- large electoral system violatedthe Fourteenth Amendment. Acknowledging that the EqualProtection Clause proscribes purposeful racial discriminationby any unit of state government, the Supreme Court pluralitynonetheless held that \"evidence of discrimination by whiteofficials . . . is relevant only as the most tenuous andcircumstantial evidence of the constitutional validity of theelectoral system under which they attained their offices.\" 446U.S. at 74, 100 S.Ct. at 1503 (footnote omitted). The SupremeCourt in Bolden also rejected the lower court's reliance onpast official discrimination as evidence of presentdiscriminatory intent:\n\n[T]he District Court and the Court of Appeals  supported their conclusion by drawing upon the  substantial history of official racial  discrimination in Alabama. But past  discrimination cannot, in the manner of original  sin, condemn governmental action that is not in  itself unlawful. The ultimate question remains  whether a discriminatory intent has been proved  in a given case. More distant instances of  official discrimination in other cases are of  limited help in resolving that question.\n\n446 U.S. at 74, 100 S.Ct. at 1503.\n\nThe Supreme Court in Bolden was careful to distinguish itsearlier decision in White v. Regester, 412 U.S. 755, 93 S.Ct.2332, 37 L.Ed.2d 314 (1973), in which the Court had held thatmulti-member legislative districts in Texas unconstitutionallydiluted the voting strength of black and Hispanicvoters.\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e100\u003c/span\u003e The Bolden Court characterized the systemattacked in White v. Regester as one in which \"the politicalprocesses leading to nomination and election were not equallyopen to participation by the group[s] in question.\" 446 U.S. at68-69, 100 S.Ct. at 1500 (quoting 412 U.S. at 766, 93 S.Ct. at2339).\n\nIn analyzing the problems before it in White v. Regester, theSupreme Court underscored the district court's reference to thehistory of official racial discrimination in Texas, which hadat times touched the rights of Negroes to register, vote, andotherwise participate in democratic processes. The districtcourt had also found that\n\nsince Reconstruction days, there had been only  two Negroes in the Dallas County delegation to  the Texas House of Representatives and that these  two were the only two Negroes ever slated by the  Dallas Committee for Responsible Government  (DCRG), a white-dominated organization that is in  effective control of Democratic Party candidate  slating in Dallas County.\n\n412 U.S. at 766, 93 S.Ct. at 2339. Moreover, the districtcourt had noted that the DCRG \"did not need the support of theNegro community to win elections in the county, and it did nottherefore exhibit good-faith concern for the political andother needs and aspirations of the Negro community.\" 412 U.S.at 766-67, 93 S.Ct. at 2339-40 (footnote omitted). Finally,the district court had pointed out \"that as recently as 1970the [DCRG] was relying upon `racial campaign tactics in whiteprecincts to defeat candidates that had the overwhelmingsupport of the black community.'\" 412 U.S. at 767, 93 S.Ct. at2340 (quoting 343 F. Supp. at 727). Based upon this and otherevidence the district court had concluded that \"`the blackcommunity has been effectively excluded from participation inthe Democratic primary selection process,' and was thereforegenerally not permitted to enter into the political process ina reliable and meaningful manner.\" 412 U.S. at 767, 93 S.Ct.at 2340 (quoting 343 F. Supp. at 726).\n\nThe district court in White v. Regester reached similarconclusions with respect to the Mexican-American community inBexar County. Indeed, the district court found that the typicalMexican-American suffered a cultural and language barrier thatseverely impeded his participation in political life, and thatthis \"`cultural incompatibility . . . conjoined with the polltax and the most restrictive voter registration procedures inthe nation have operated to effectively deny Mexican-Americansaccess to the political processes in Texas even longer than theBlacks were formerly denied access to the white primary.'\" 412U.S. at 768, 93 S.Ct. at 2340 (quoting 343 F. Supp. at 731).\n\nAlthough racism certainly exists in the City of Chicago andin that City's Democratic organization, the record before usdoes not disclose a history of overt and systematic electoraldiscrimination comparable to that identified by the districtcourt in White v. Regester. For example, Illinois has never hada white primary or a poll tax. Moreover, unlike theorganization previously in control of the Democratic Party inDallas County, the Democratic organization in the City ofChicago depends upon the support of the black community to winelections and must, therefore, be at least somewhat responsiveto the needs and aspirations of black voters. The record in theinstant case does not suggest that causes helpful to blackshave been ignored by the Democratic organization; in fact, justthe opposite seems to be the case. The Democratic Party inIllinois has been a principal exponent of civil rightslegislation and of social legislation important to blacks. Ithas also supported bilingual education, an issue of particularimportance to Hispanics. In sum, there has been no systematicexclusion of either blacks or Hispanics from the Illinoispolitical process comparable to the history referred to inWhite v. Regester.\n\nOn the other hand poor socio-economic conditions,unemployment, low voter registration and the like afflict boththe black and the Hispanic communities in Chicago to an extentwhich may be comparable to that presented in White v. Regester.We conclude, therefore, that while plaintiffs' general evidenceof racial discrimination in the City of Chicago supports ourpresent findings of purposeful vote dilution, we place greaterreliance on such specific factors as retrogression in blacklegislative representation and the manipulation of racialpopulations in the interest of white incumbents to demonstratepurposeful racial vote dilution than we do on the general actsand attitudes of city and state officials.\n\nIV. Complaint of the DelValle Plaintiffs: Dilution of      Hispanic Voting Strength\n\nAt trial, the DelValle plaintiffs presented evidence in aneffort to provethat the Commission purposefully diluted Hispanic votingstrength. There are approximately 425,000 Hispanics residingin the City of Chicago, comprising 14% of the City's totalpopulation. Although not nearly as concentrated as the blacks,the majority of Chicago's Hispanic population reside in twolarge aggregations, referred to at trial as the NorthwestHispanic group (primarily Puerto Ricans residing in the WestTown and Humboldt Park neighborhoods) and the SouthwestHispanic group (primarily Mexican-Americans residing in thePilsen and Little Village neighborhoods).\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e101\u003c/span\u003e TheDelValle plaintiffs contended that although Commissioner Murphyand Representative Madigan were aware of these sizable Hispanicpopulation centers, they intentionally fractured both Hispaniccommunities by dividing each community among four separatelegislative districts. Murphy and Madigan justified theirdecision by claiming that these districts were designed toaccommodate future growth and migration patterns which theyallege are characteristic of these Hispanic communities.Commissioner Murphy analogized this justification to buying asnowsuit for a young child — purchasing a suit several sizeslarger than the growing child's present dimensions is warrantedin order to allow the child to grow into the suit and thusprolong its use.\n\nThe Hispanics challenged this explanation by noting that noother racial, ethnic or political group was fitted to\"snowsuit\" districts and that the Commission's actions servedto exacerbate existing underrepresentation of Hispanicinterests in the General Assembly.\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e102\u003c/span\u003e TheDelValle plaintiffs adduced considerable additional evidenceconcerning further unsuccessful efforts to alert the Commissionto their needs, changes in proposed districts to theirdetriment based on incumbent and other influences, thedepressed socio-economic condition of their constituency andvarious other factors tending to show vote dilution.\n\nDuring and after the trial and at the urging of the court,representatives of the Commission and the DelValle plaintiffsdeveloped several alternative configurations for the districtsin the two Chicago Hispanic communities. Negotiations betweenthe parties (fortified by instructions from the court as tomodifications of the Commission Plan) eventually resulted in asettlement proposal, embodied in Court Exhibits 7D and 7E,which was accepted by both the Commission and the DelValleplaintiffs.\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e103\u003c/span\u003e Under the resulting Hispanic SettlementAgreement, Hispanics will constitute approximately 71% of thepopulation in Commission House District 20, encompassing thePilsen and Little Village neighborhoods.\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e104\u003c/span\u003e The DelValleplaintiffs believethat Hispanic residents of this area will now have ameaningful opportunity to elect a candidate of their choice tothe Illinois legislature. On Chicago's Northwest Side,Hispanics will constitute approximately 63% of the populationin Commission House District 9 and 50% of the population inCommission House District 10. Commission Senate District 5,which encompasses these two House districts, will contain anHispanic population of approximately 56%. TheDelValle plaintiffs believe that the Settlement Agreementsimilarly accords Hispanics residing in this area the bestachievable opportunity to elect candidates of their choice.\n\nUnder all the circumstances, we find that the HispanicSettlement Agreement is fair, adequate and reasonable toHispanics and affords them a fair opportunity to electcandidates of their choice to the General Assembly. Under theSettlement Agreement there is no purposeful dilution of theHispanic vote. We further find that the Hispanic Settlement isfair to other minorities whose voting power is allegedlysubject to dilution. In addition, we find that the SettlementAgreement is fair to the Commission and to all the voters ofthe State of Illinois, and is in accordance with state andfederal constitutional standards. We therefore accept andapprove those portions of Court Exhibit Plans 1A, 7D and 7E(together with other supporting documents that relate toredistricting of the House Districts 9, 10 and 20 and relateddistricts) as a reasonable settlement of the DelValle claims.The changes produced by the Hispanic Settlement Agreement havebeen incorporated into the Plan and Map for the State ofIllinois approved by this opinion.\n\nV. Remedy\n\nWe have held that the Commission Plan unconstitutionallydilutes the voting strength of blacks in two areas: first, inCommission Senate Districts 8 and 9 (Commission HouseDistricts 15, 17 and 18) on Chicago's West Side; and second,in Commission Senate Districts 14, 17 and 18 (Commission HouseDistricts 27, 28, 33, 34, 35 and 36) on Chicago's South Side.Our work is not finished, however, with this finding ofliability. In redistricting and reapportionment cases, theSupreme Court has instructed us to provide for a remedy thatcures the unconstitutional aspects of a redistrictingplan.\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e105\u003c/span\u003e See, e.g., Connor v. Finch, 431 U.S. 407, 414-15,97 S.Ct. 1828, 1833-34, 52 L.Ed.2d 465 (1977); Mahan v. Howell,410 U.S. 315, 330-33, 93 S.Ct. 979, 987-89, 35 L.Ed.2d 320(1973); Reynolds v. Sims, 377 U.S. 533, 584-87, 84 S.Ct. 1362,1393-94, 12 L.Ed.2d 506 (1964); Roman v. Sincock, 377 U.S. 695,710-11, 84 S.Ct. 1449, 1458-59, 12 L.Ed.2d 620 (1964). See alsoRobinson v. Commissioners Court, 505 F.2d 674 (5th Cir. 1974);Graves v. Barnes, 408 F. Supp. 1050 (W.D.Tex. 1976). Because ourfinding of liability is limited to two relatively small groupsof districts, we believe that the remedy should be designed toameliorate the effects of unconstitutional vote dilution inthose two areas. Cf. White v. Regester, 412 U.S. 755, 93 S.Ct.2332, 37 L.Ed.2d 314 (1973) (approving districtcourt order that disestablished multi-member districts in twoTexas counties).\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e106\u003c/span\u003e\n\nDuring the course of trial, the Commission, pursuant todirection of the court, prepared several plans (denominated asthe Court Exhibit Plans) to incorporate adjustments to theoriginal Commission Plan. Those adjustments were specificallydirected at the districts we have now identified as theproducts of unconstitutional dilution of black votingstrength.\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e107\u003c/span\u003e We believe that the adjustments to theCommission Plan embodied in Court Exhibits 1A (South Sideblack objections), 2A (suburban objections) and 7B (West Sideblack objections and Hispanic settlement), together with theirsupporting documents, computer printouts and metes and boundsdescriptions, adequately purge the Commission Plan ofunconstitutional vote dilution and other errors withoutupsetting the broader contours of the Plan which have passedour close scrutiny.\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e108\u003c/span\u003e\n\nTo recapitulate, the remedy we have adopted eradicates theunconstitutional dilution of black voting strength byincreasing by one Senate and one House district the number ofvoting districts in which blacks will have a meaningfulopportunity to elect a candidate of their choice to theIllinois General Assembly. We have also approved as fair aSettlement Agreement that provides Hispanic voters residing onboth the Northwest and Southwest Sides of Chicago a meaningfulopportunity to participate in state electoral politics.Finally, we have accepted certain modifications in the Mapproffered by the Commission for the Chicago suburbs.\n\nThe court therefore enters the following ORDER:\n\nThe foregoing memorandum opinion is hereby adopted asfindings of fact and conclusions of law in this proceeding. Itis therefore ordered that the State Board of Elections putinto effect the Commission Plan, as amended by Court Exhibits1A, 2A, 7B, 7D and 7E.\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e109\u003c/span\u003e It is further ordered that saidplan of reapportionment govern the election of Representativesand Senators to the Illinois General Assembly, beginning withthe 1982 primary and general elections and continuingthereafter until these districts are again reapportioned inaccordance with law.\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e110\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003e1.

The 1971 plan was adopted pursuant to a partisancompromise within the Legislative Redistricting Commission.Cecil Partee, former President of the Illinois Senate,testified in detail about the drafting process in 1971.See Tr. at 1238-41. Because it was the product of a compromise,certain features of the 1971 map were assertedly understood bythe Democratic drafters to represent a politically fairsolution to partisan differences. The compromise was thereforeaccorded, at least by the Democrats, a great deal ofprecedential value. The outstanding feature of the compromisewas that a number of the districts located in predominantlyDemocratic Chicago overlapped into largely Republican, suburbanCook County. Although the procedures used for selecting theCommission members who drew the 1971 plan were later ruledinvalid, both the Illinois Supreme Court and a three-judgepanel of this court upheld that plan against various federaland state constitutional challenges. See Grivetti v. IllinoisState Electoral Bd., 335 F. Supp. 779 (N.D.Ill. 1971), aff'd,406 U.S. 913, 92 S.Ct. 1772, 32 L.Ed.2d 113 (1972); People exrel. Scott v.

Governor Shapiro insisted on one change in the plandeveloped by the Democratic Commission members, namely that\"independent\" Democratic incumbent Senators Dawn Clark Netschand William Marovitz be placed in separate districts. Theoriginal proposal of the Democratic Commissioners had placedboth Netsch and Marovitz in Senate District 3. GovernorShapiro also asked that the population deviation of the planbe reduced.\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003e16. During trial, issue was taken with the proceduresemployed by the Democratic Commission members in adoptingtheir plan. The law required that a plan be completed andadopted by October 5 and the rules adopted by the Commissionrequired that any plan considered for adoption must bepresented at least 24 hours before a final vote was taken.Accordingly, a meeting of the Commission was called by theDemocrats for October 2 at 8:30 p.m. Although a map reflectingthe plan was given to the Republican members on October 1, acomplete set of census materials supporting the plan were notdistributed until the evening of October 2. CommissionerCasey, a Republican appointee, did not state how theRepublican Commission members were prejudiced by this allegedfailure by the Democrats to produce on time the more complexdetails of their plan, such as metes and boundsdescriptions.\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003e17. Under the 1971 reapportionment, the state was dividedinto 59 districts, each of which elected one senator and threerepresentatives. The representatives were elected at largefrom each district with the use of cumulative votingprocedures. In November of 1980, this system of apportionmentfor the House was abolished by the so-called \"CutbackAmendment.\" Under the Cutback Amendment, the size of the Housewas decreased from 177 seats to 118 seats; multi-memberdistricts and cumulative voting were also eliminated. Underthe new system, which is being implemented in Illinois for thefirst time in this redistricting process, the state is dividedinto 59 Senate districts each of which in turn is dividedgeographically into two single-member House districts of equalpopulation.\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003e18.

It is interesting from a forensic as well as amathematical standpoint that defendants' calculations ofextreme lengths and widths are quite different fromplaintiffs'. See Def. Ex. 48. Defendants' ratios were obtainedby comparing the longest length against the widest (andtherefore the most extreme) width, rather than against thenarrowest width. The result is that the House districtsplaintiffs complain of (e.g., 58, 87, 37, 104) have relativelyinnocuous ratios under defendants' criteria of 2.16:1, 1.26:1,1.46:1, 1.96:1 and 1.66:1, respectively.\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003e25.

The political fairness of the plan was analyzed byreviewing the voting patterns at the census tract level forfive different elections: The University of Illinois Trusteeelections in 1978 and 1980; the State Senate elections for1978 or 1980 (Senate terms being staggered); and the StateRepresentative elections for 1978 and 1980. Political strengthwas gauged by the number of wins and losses sustained by eachparty throughout the six elections. If one party won all fiveelections, the district was considered a \"firm\" district. Ifthe party won four of the elections, the district wasconsidered \"soft.\" If a party won two or three of theelections, the district was denominated a \"swing\"district.\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003e29. Plaintiffs attack defendants' projections on the groundthat the projections do not consider the residence ofincumbents, the quality of the candidates and the type ofcampaign likely to be waged. Plaintiffs have submitted nospecific evidence, however, contradicting the validity ofdefendants' basic assumption that voting will tend to proceedroughly along party lines. Moreover, we do not believe thatthe existence of the variables identified by the plaintiffsnecessarily renders defendants' projections invalid.

Defendants have, for the most part, justified anyslight deviations from normal \"compactness\" by demonstratingthat the districts were drawn as such to recognize allegedcommunities of interest, to follow natural, ecological orpolitical boundaries or to satisfy population equalitystandards. Such justifications are appropriately considered,given that Illinois does not require perfect compactness,Schrage, 88 Ill.2d at 96, 58 Ill.Dec. 451, 430 N.E.2d 483.

Illinois is comprised of 102 counties. Under theCommission Plan, 48 counties are fractured, i.e., they containdistricts that cross over county lines. Some of these countiesare fractured a number of times thus creating a total of 122separate fractures of county boundary lines in the CommissionPlan.\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003e53. The Village of Oak Park, Illinois, a suburban communitywest of Chicago, filed a brief as amicus curiae urging thecourt to adopt a redistricting plan that avoids any unnecessaryfracturing of the community among legislative districtscontaining parts of its population. Unfortunately, although werecognize the merit of Oak Park's objections (based onfracturing) to portions of the remedy we have adopted in thisproceeding, we feel that the black voting dilution claim, whichwas addressed in part by certain changes in the border area ofChicago and Oak Park, must be accorded high priority. Since wehave relied on the Commission to address the details of thenecessary census tract shifts, we cannot without risking lossof control of the process, accommodate all other objections.\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003e54.

In Skolnick v. State Electoral Board, 336 F. Supp. 839(N.D.Ill. 1971), the court purported to reject a redistrictingplan because in an attempt to create compact and contiguousdistricts, it failed to respect political boundaries. Thestatements made in Skolnick which subordinate compactness torespect for political boundaries did not purport to interpretIllinois law. As we discuss elsewhere, Illinois recentlydeemphasized the significance of political boundaries whilerevitalizing the compactness standard in Schrage. Moreover, theSkolnick opinion did not purport to hold that preservation oftraditional political boundaries was mandated by the federalConstitution. Indeed, in a similar case involving a challengeto the population deviations of a state redistricting plan, theSupreme Court also denied any special constitutional privilegefor political boundaries by noting that \"[r]ecognition that astate may properly seek to protect the integrity of politicalsubdivisions or historical boundary lines permits no more than`minor deviations' from the basic requirement that legislativedistricts must be `as nearly of equal population as ispracticable.'\" Connor v. Finch, 431 U.S. 407, 419, 97 S.Ct.1828, 1836, 52 L.Ed.2d 465 (1977) (quoting Roman v.

The intent underlying this deletion was clearlyexpressed by one of the drafters of the 1970 Constitution asfollows: \"The least we can do is not to mandate thelegislature to follow municipal boundaries, county boundaries,or others, but to apportion this state as near as possible ona basis of equal population.\" 4 Record of Proceedings, SixthIllinois Constitutional Convention 2937 (1970) (remarks ofDelegate Nicholson).\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003e58. The Illinois Supreme Court's most recent decision inSchrage v. State Board of Elections, 88 Ill.2d 87, 58 Ill.Dec.451, 430 N.E.2d 483 (1981), is not to the contrary. To be sure,in Schrage, at 104, 58 Ill.Dec. 451, 430 N.E.2d 483, the courtnoted that \"`[i]ndiscriminate districting, without regard forpolitical subdivisions or natural or historical boundary lines,may be little more than an open invitation to partisangerrymandering'\" (quoting Reynolds v. Sims, 377 U.S. 533,578-79, 84 S.Ct. 1362, 1390-91, 12 L.Ed.2d 506 (1964)). Thechallenged district in that case — House District 89 — involvedthe indiscriminate disregard of political subdivisionboundaries, since that district fractured at least six countiesand numerous townships. But, notwithstanding its discussion ofpolitical boundaries, it is also clear that the Schrage courtwas primarily concerned with the compactness of the district inquestion. Indeed, the court's stated reason for invalidatingthe Commission Plan as to District 89 was not the fracturing ofcounty lines per se but rather the production of a noncompactdistrict by fracturing. As previously noted, we have found noother districts in the Commission Plan which violate thecompactness standard. We think it would be incorrect tointerpret the Schrage language on fracturing in a contextisolated from the question of compactness.\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003e59. Witnesses for the Rybicki plaintiffs sharply criticizedthe Commission Plan's apparent indiscriminate fracturing ofDuPage County, among other collar counties. At the request ofthe court during the trial, the Commission made several changesin its Plan to accommodate some of the objections of allplaintiffs, including the Rybicki plaintiffs, in an effort toreach a settlement. See Court Exhibits 1A, 2A and 2E (andsupporting documents). We are accepting these proffered changesas they affect DuPage County and the other collar counties. Thesuggestion in the Rybicki plaintiffs' Offer of Proof filed onDecember 11, 1981 (in opposition to these Court Exhibits), thatthe majority of the Commission be allowed to draw the Chicagodistricts while the Rybicki plaintiffs be permitted to draw alldistricts in the collar counties seems to violate the thrust ofIllinois redistricting procedure. The defendant Commission(which is controlled by its majority, is charged under Illinoislaw with responsibility for redistricting the General Assembly.We are also accepting the changes made by the various CourtExhibits in connection with the claims of the Crosby andDelValle plaintiffs. We think any further changes areunnecessary and would not be congruent with the rest of the mapas modified.\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003e60. See note 54 supra.\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003e61. We may fairly characterize the evidence presented attrial concerning the partisan politics of these geographicareas by noting that the majority of voters residing inChicago are Democrats while the majority of their suburbancounterparts are Republicans. To the extent that plaintiffs'claim of suburban vote dilution involves partisan politicalconcerns, we address those concerns separately,infra.\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003e62. In the context of this discussion, we use the genericterm \"suburbs\" to refer to Cook County outside Chicago,together with the collar counties.\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003e63. Plaintiffs cite statements from Reynolds v. Sims,377 U.S. 533, 567 n. 43, 84 S.Ct. 1362, 1384 n. 43, 12 L.Ed.2d 506(1964), and Dallas County v. Reese, 421 U.S. 477, 480, 95 S.Ct.1706, 1707, 44 L.Ed.2d 312 (1975) (per curiam), to indicatethat the Court has at least contemplated the protection ofsuburbanites or other groups from vote dilution. We note thatthe Court's statements regarding \"fast-moving suburban areas\"in Reynolds were expressly related to the possibility of asuburban-based population equality (i.e., one-person, one-vote)challenge. We do not view this sort of claim as necessarilycomparable to a vote dilution claim such as the instant one,which is unaccompanied by any contention that districts do notcontain equal population. Similarly, the statement plaintiffsrely upon from Reese was the Court's attempt to explain that,under Dusch v. Davis, 387 U.S. 112, 87 S.Ct. 1554, 18 L.Ed.2d656 (1967), a single-member districting scheme actuallyoperated on a county-wide basis as an at-large districtingscheme which would \"dilute\" the votes of some city or countyresidents by violating the population equality principle.\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003eThe only other authorities cited by plaintiffs for theproposition that suburbanites are protected from vote dilutionare several opinions by Justice Stevens, see City of Mobile v.Bolden, 446 U.S. 55, 86, 100 S.Ct. 1490, 1509, 64 L.Ed.2d 47(1980) (Stevens, J., concurring in judgment); Cousins v.

Despite our great respect for the wisdomand insight of Justice Stevens, we note that no other SupremeCourt Justice nor any other judge of this circuit has followedJustice Stevens and adopted his views on this subject.\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003e64.

Based upon an analysis of the 1978 and 1980 electionreturns from the University of Illinois Trustee elections andfrom the Illinois House and Senate elections, the Commissionestimates that its Plan will provide 39 \"firm\" Democratic, 5\"soft\" Democratic, 41 \"firm\" Republican, 10 \"soft\" Republicanand 23 \"swing\" seats in the Illinois House of Representatives.For the Illinois Senate, the Commission estimates 21 \"firm\"Democratic, 25 \"firm\" Republican, 3 \"soft\" Republican and 10\"swing\" seats. Plaintiffs challenge the defendants' use ofthis data, especially the results of trustee elections and oflegislative elections, to predict the results of elections inthe new single-member districts for the General Assembly. Wenote, however, that plaintiffs have not produced anyalternative systematic methodology for more accuratelypredicting election results and, thus, we must accept thedefendants' evidence as the most systematic available.\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003e66.

Somewhat related to their political fairness concerns,the Rybicki plaintiffs also alleged that the DemocraticCommission members acted in bad faith by failing to providetheir Republican counterparts with copies of the \"Shapiro Plan\"sufficiently in advance of the October 2, 1981, Commissionmeeting, at which the Plan was adopted by a 5 to 4 vote alongparty lines. Even if plaintiffs could clearly demonstrate somedegree of \"bad faith\" on the part of the Democrats, we findthat the plaintiffs have not shown that the RepublicanCommission members were prejudiced by the Democrats' conductprior to the adoption of the Shapiro Plan. By votingunanimously against the Plan, the Republicans merely did whatappeared to be inevitable under all the circumstances. It isnot clear what they might have done differently even if everydetail of the Democrats' plan had been delivered to them weeksearlier.\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003e68.

Although their complaint concerns all black residentsand voters in Illinois, the Crosby plaintiffs concentratedtheir efforts at trial on those portions of the Commission Plancontaining House or Senate districts located in whole or inpart within the City of Chicago.\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003e70. Justices Stevens (446 U.S. at 84-85), White (446 U.S.at 102) and Marshall (446 U.S. at 104-05, 125-29) expresslystated that a vote dilution claim is cognizable under theFifteenth Amendment. Because Justices Brennan and Blackmun didnot articulate their view on this question, the majority viewis unknown. In these circumstances, we believe it isappropriate to adopt the plurality view of the FifteenthAmendment — a view which is also consistent with our reading ofprior appellate opinions on this subject. See McMillan v.Escambia County, 638 F.2d 1239, 1243 n. 9 (5th Cir.), cert.dismissed sub nom. City of Pensacola v. Jenkins, 102 S.Ct. 17(1981). Even if Justice Brennan's opinion can be interpreted asan implicit approval of the application of the FifteenthAmendment in vote dilution cases, this would not alter theresult we reach in the instant case (as the Crosby plaintiffsapparently argue). It is evident that only two Justices —Brennan and Marshall — adopt the \"discriminatory impact\"standard for a Fifteenth Amendment claim, 446 U.S. at 94,130-41; Justice Stevens, although accepting an \"objective\"approach, rejected any across-the-board application of thediscriminatory impact standard, 446 U.S. at 85-86, 90. But fiveJustices — the plurality Justices, 446 U.S. at 63-65, andJustice White, 446 U.S. at 95, 101-03 — expressly held that theFifteenth Amendment requires proof of discriminatory purpose orintent. Thus, even if we were to recognize plaintiffs' claimshere under the Fifteenth Amendment, we would apply the samestandard — discriminatory purpose — as we do under theFourteenth Amendment, as discussed infra.\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003e71.

The concurring opinion of Justice Stevens inBolden, in which none of the other Justices joined, apparentlyespoused the position that only decisions which were \"totallyirrational or entirely motivated by a desire to curtail thepolitical strength of the minority\" would violate theFourteenth Amendment. 446 U.S. at 90, 100 S.Ct. at 1512.Concomitantly, Justice Stevens also noted that decisionsaffecting voting rights could still be valid even if motivatedin part by \"irrational or invidious factors.\" 446 U.S. at 91,100 S.Ct. at 1512.

A comparison of racial population percentages in formerlegislative districts (created in 1971) with percentages inthe districts as redrawn by the Commission is pertinentparticularly because the drafters of the Commission's Chicagoarea districts testified that they attempted to follow the1971 boundaries, readjusting lines where necessary to add orsubtract population as mandated by the 1980 census.\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003e77. Other evidence of discriminatory intent is abundanthere, thus distinguishing the instant case fromMcMillan. As described below, racial population shifts,purportedly designed to preserve white incumbencies, areevident in several other Chicago districts. Moreover, blackpopulation has been purposefully packed or fractured in certaindistricts, resulting in a dilution of black voting strength.\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003e78. The Commission's efforts designed to save the seats ofwhite incumbents in Chicago, such as Senator Dawson, can onlybe construed as exercises in purposeful discrimination. Unlikemost efforts to save the seats of incumbent legislators, whichcan be explained by partisan political concerns, partisanpolitics does not explain the Commission's actions in thiscase. It is undisputed that the vast majority, if not all, ofthe legislators likely to be elected from black areas inChicago will be Democrats, regardless whether the candidate iswhite or black. Thus, the Commission's preference for a whiteincumbent over a potentially black challenger seems clearly toreflect racial rather than partisan political concerns.\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003e79. Blacks comprise approximately 85% of the population inCommission Senate District 17.\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003e80. An intent to dilute is also evident from thegerrymandering that was necessary to create this district. Inthe course of creating this unusually-shaped district, theCommission dropped a \"finger\" from the Chicago portions of thedistrict to reach into part of the South Suburban Cook Countyarea where a substantial black population resides. While asmall portion of this black suburban area was fractured offfor inclusion in Senate District 17, the remaining portions ofthis black population center were further fractured betweentwo other suburban Senate districts.\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003e81. We recognize, of course, that under circumstances otherthan those presented in this case, the adjustment oflegislative districts to accommodate incumbencies would notnecessarily represent purposeful racial discrimination.See Burns v.

This shift of blacks out of former Senate District 18apparently amounted to the removal of most of the blackpopulation from the southern part of that Senate district.Thus, this shift of black population and its replacement bywhites amounted to dilution to the extent of about one Housedistrict (since the blacks were split between Commissiondistricts).\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003e83. Defendants attempted to explain the population shiftsin former Senate District 18 and Commission Senate District 8by asserting that these shifts were made to comply with therequest of the Village of Oak Park that it not be fracturedamong two or more districts (as in the past). In his dissent,Judge Grady apparently accepts defendants' explanation for theconfiguration of Senate District 18. Even if this explanationis to be accepted, we do not believe it is sufficient tojustify the serious dilution of black voting strength.

As noted previously, we find insufficient an apparentexplanation that the various population shifts in the Southand West Side districts were effected to preserve incumbents'seats in the General Assembly.

The history of this country has been marked by  racial tension. It is something that people who  are fair-minded, who believe in democracy, who  believe in integration, have to get around. There  was racial tension in the South when the  desegregation of the buses occurred,  desegregation of the lunch counters and of the  schools. There is still racial tension. There is  still racial tension in Chicago. But it seems to  me that is a very poor reason to segregate people  and to have an official imprimatur on the  creation of a legislative ghetto in Chicago, and  that is what this map, in my opinion, does.\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003eTr. at 2058, 2062.

Judge Grady, in finding the South Side district linesunconstitutional per se, prescribes as a \"remedy\" the drawingof a whole new Chicago map along \"color-blind\" lines. Since anyhuman redistricter is well aware of the racial concentrationsin the City, we can only suppose that a racially \"neutral\" mapwould have to be constructed by a computer. We have gravedoubts as to whether such a \"color- blind\" map would beaccepted as neutral by any of the parties to this lawsuit.\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003eMoreover, it seems to us that any form of \"neutral\"construction of compact districts will, as a matter ofmathematical probability, leave the black South Side in justas \"packed\" a condition as exists under the Commission Plan.For the electoral boundaries on the South Side did not\"create\" the heavy black voting concentrations; these linesmerely stand in the way of affirmative compensation for highlyconcentrated black populations through the inclusion ofneighboring white areas in the black-controlleddistricts.\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003e96. Justice Whittaker, in a concurring opinion, indicatedthat he would rest the Court's decision not on the FifteenthAmendment but on the Equal Protection Clause of the FourteenthAmendment.

Judge Grady's dissent fundamentally mischaracterizesthe thrust of our analysis. Our opinion does not sanctionstate-imposed segregation nor does it even remotely adopt some\"separate but better off\" theory noted by Justice Douglas indissent in Wright v. Rockefeller. The portions of our opinionthat Judge Grady quotes prominently merely point out theobvious tension (if not contradiction) between recognizingclaims based on the dilution of racial bloc voting, on the onehand, and proposing a \"color-blind\" redistricting process onthe other. Like the Supreme Court in Wright, we havespecifically held that the South Side voting districts are not\"the product of a state contrivance to segregate.\" 376 U.S. at58, 84 S.Ct. at 606. Given this holding, the post-Brownsegregation cases relied on by Judge Grady, all of whichinvolved the use of an explicit racial classification by thegovernment, are totally inapposite to the instant case. Weagree with Judge Grady that explicit racial classifications areinherently stigmatizing and need no evidentiary support.However, we also believe, and the Supreme Court has held, thatstate action which on its face relies on criteria other thanrace (such as neighborhood affiliation) requires a far moresophisticated analysis. Compare Brown v. Board of Education,349 U.S. 294, 75 S.Ct. 753, 99 L.Ed. 1083 (1955), withWashington v. Davis, 426 U.S. 229, 96 S.Ct. 2040, 48 L.Ed.2d597 (1976) and Village of Arlington Heights v.

Regester, the Supreme Court stated thatmulti-member districts were not per se unconstitutional, butnoted that it had entertained claims that multi-memberdistricts were being used invidiously to cancel out or minimizethe voting strength of racial groups. The Court stated that tosustain such claims, it was not enough that the racial groupallegedly discriminated against had not held legislative seatsin proportion to its voting potential. Instead the plaintiffs'burden was \"to produce evidence to support findings that thepolitical processes leading to nomination and election were notequally open to participation by the group in question — thatits members had less opportunity than did other residents inthe district to participate in the political processes and toelect legislators of their choice.\" 412 U.S. at 766, 93 S.Ct.at 2339.\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003e101.

The parties' final Stipulation of Settlement makesminor changes in these Court Exhibits in order to correct anerror appearing in the metes and bounds descriptions ofRepresentative Districts 9 and 10.

Any further adjustments will be reported promptly tothe court, which retains jurisdiction for this purpose.\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003eWe also note that although the Hispanic Settlement willincrease the total deviation for Commission Plan Housedistricts to approximately 2.4%, and to approximately 1.8% forCommission Senate districts, these deviations are well withinthe guidelines approved by the Supreme Court for both acourt-developed plan, see Connor v.

The Hispanic Settlement Agreement reads in part asfollows:   . . the Hispanic plaintiffs believe that Senate  Districts 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 11 and 18, and House  Districts 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 20, 21, 22  and 35, as constituted in the [Settlement  Agreement], fairly and reasonably provide  Hispanics in those districts with the right to  participate and vote in electing representatives  from those districts to the Illinois General  Assembly without fear of dilution of their vote  considering the 1980 Census data and the  geographic location of concentrations of Hispanic  population. . . .\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003eBecause no class was certified in this case, the partiesneeded only to secure the approval of the named plaintiffs forthis settlement. Attorneys for the DelValle plaintiffsdiligently secured such approval.\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003e105. We are providing specific remedies designed to curespecific unconstitutional features of the Commission Plan.Contrary to Judge Grady's apparent assertion, this is not\"affirmative action,\" and we do not believe affirmative actionis mandated in these circumstances. See Whitcomb v. Chavis,403 U.S. 124, 156-60, 91 S.Ct. 1858, 1875-77, 29 L.Ed.2d 363(1971). Nor have we adopted a theory of proportionalrepresentation, as Judge Grady initially suggests, but is laterforced to retreat from, in his dissent. Rather, our remedycomports with the mandate of the Supreme Court that oncepurposeful discrimination has been found, a federal court isauthorized, under its inherent equitable powers, to take raceinto account in fashioning an appropriate and effective remedy.See e.g., Milliken v. Bradley (Milliken II), 433 U.S. 267,280-88, 97 S.Ct. 2749, 2756- 61, 53 L.Ed.2d 745 (1977); Swannv.

We do not believe it appropriate to discard the entireCommission Plan because part of it is infected by anunconstitutional purpose to dilute. Such a broad remedy isappropriate when the unconstitutional element pervades theentire plan. Cf. Kirkpatrick v. Preisler, 394 U.S. 526, 89S.Ct. 1225, 22 L.Ed.2d 519 (1969) (congressional districtingstatute for Missouri invalidated in its entirety sincelegislature relied on inaccurate population data and createdlarge population deviations).\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003e107. Court Exhibit 1A corrected the substantial votedilution found in the Commission Plan by reconfiguring (amongothers) House Districts 33, 34, 35 and 36, resulting intwo Senate districts (District 17, with a 70% black population,and District 18, with a 66% black population) where blacks willhave a meaningful opportunity to elect candidates of theirchoice, in contrast to one Senate district under the originalCommission Plan. Court Exhibit 7B (which incorporates theHispanic Settlement Agreement integrated with Court Exhibit 5B)reconfigures numerous districts in the West and North Westareas of Chicago resulting in one Senate district (District 9,with a 74% black population) and four House districts(District 15 (66% black), District 17 (72% black), District 18(77% black) and District 19 (76% black) where blacks have ameaningful opportunity to elect representatives of their choicein contrast to only one Senate district and three Housedistricts under the original Commission Plan. Court Exhibit 2A,which has already been integrated with these adjustments to theCommission Plan, is also adopted in order, inter alia, toalleviate the ripple effect of adjustments in the CommissionPlan.\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003e108. Several plaintiff and amicus parties have urged us toadopt alternative plans that they have formulated during thecourse of litigation as remedies for various defects they orwe perceive in the Commission Plan. These parties have notcited any controlling authority that would require us to adoptsuch alternative plans. We also note that, in view of thespecific and relatively localized defects we have found,adopting such an \"outside\" plan in its entirety wouldinappropriately preempt the redistricting procedure authorizedby the people of Illinois and the agencies empowered byIllinois law. See White v. Weiser, 412 U.S. 783, 795, 93 S.Ct.2348, 2354, 37 L.Ed.2d 335 (1973); Whitcomb v. Chavis,403 U.S. 124, 160-61, 91 S.Ct. 1858, 1877-78, 29 L.Ed.2d 363 (1971);Reynolds v. Sims, 377 U.S. 533, 584-87, 84 S.Ct. 1362, 1393-94,12 L.Ed.2d 506 (1964). We think it would be foolish to \"drawour own map\" or have a third party draw a map for us when weare able, by addressing instructions to the Commission, toeliminate the unconstitutional (and therefore unacceptable)features of the Commission Plan. Moreover, we note that severalof these alternative plans, including the so-called CrosbyPlan which was filed with the court several weeks after trialas an offer of proof and the \"plan\" submitted by the amicusVillage of Oak Park shortly before this opinion was issued,would undoubtedly raise numerous problems if they were to beexplored in depth. We do not believe such broadening of theissues is tolerable given the time constraints of thislitigation and the lack of findings by the court requiring asweeping restructuring of the Commission Plan or its effectivereplacement.\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003e109. Metes and bounds descriptions for all final districtboundaries are contained in a document filed by the Commissionon January 4, 1982, as modified by the Commission in theHispanic Settlement Agreement (to correct various minorerrors).
