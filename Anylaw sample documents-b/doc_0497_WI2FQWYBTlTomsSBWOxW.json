    "body": "ORDER\n\nThe United States Constitution requires the governing officials of theState of South Carolina to enact new districting plans for the SouthCarolina Senate, the South Carolina House of Representatives, and theUnited States Congressional districts within the state on an equipopulousbasis every ten years, in accordance with population changes revealed bythe decennial census. Unfortunately, the governing officials of the Stateof South Carolina, following receipt of the 2000 census data, failed tosuccessfully fulfill this duty and have now reached an impasse. After alengthy period of mapping, the South Carolina General Assembly, in whichRepublicans constitute a majority of both houses, prepared redistrictingplans for all three bodies, but the plans were vetoed by Governor JamesH. Hodges, a Democrat. The General Assembly failed in its attempt tooverride the veto, prompting the filing of these consolidated lawsuits.In each case now before the court, the plaintiffs seek a declaration thatthe existing districting plans for each elective district areunconstitutional and the implementation of interim court-ordered plans intime for impending 2002 elections. Thus, this court has once again beenplaced into the center of partisan politics in South Carolina, assignedthe \"unwelcome obligation\" of devising and approving redistricting plansfor each legislative body. Connor v. Finch, 431 U.S. 407, 415 (1977).\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e1\u003c/span\u003e\n\nI. Background\n\nSouth Carolina's General Assembly is composed of two bodies: a Senatewith forty-six single-member district seats, see S.C. Const. art. III,§§ 1 \u0026 6, and a House of Representatives with 124 single-memberdistrict seats, see S.C. Const. art. III, § 3. South Carolina is alsoentitled to six representatives in the United States House ofRepresentatives. Within quite limited variances, federal law requiresthat the South Carolina General Assembly redraw each seat in itsbicameral state legislature, see Reynolds v. Sims, 377 U.S. 533, 577-80(1964), as well as each of its six congressional seats in the UnitedStates House of Representatives, see U.S. Const. art. 1, § 2, cl. 3;Karcher v. Daggett, 462 U.S. 725, 730-31 (1983), on an equipopulous basisin accordance with the results of the decennial census.\n\nIn anticipation of receiving the results of the 2000 census, and theinevitable malapportionment of existing districts it would reveal, theSouth Carolina General Assembly set upon a course to adopt newredistricting plans for its two governing bodies, as well as for its sixUnited StatesCongressional districts. The process began in January2001, with the introduction of skeleton bills H.3003 (for the SouthCarolina House of Representatives) and H.4182 (for the United StatesHouse of Representatives). The bills were given first reading andreferred by the House Speaker to the House Judiciary Committee for use asredistricting vehicles in the General Assembly.\n\nThe House Judiciary Committee received the year 2000 census data fromthe United States Census Bureau on March 15, 2001. During the month ofJune 2001. the House Election Laws Subcommittee held public hearings inseveral locations throughout the state, taking testimony from citizensand public officials regarding the proposed House, Senate, andCongressional plans. The full House of Representatives beganconsideration of House and Congressional redistricting plans passed bythe House Judiciary Committee on August 13, 2001. Plans for the House(H.3003) and Congressional seats (H.4182) were subsequently passed by theHouse and then submitted to the Senate for consideration on August 17,2001.\n\nThe Senate, through a similar Redistricting Subcommittee of itsJudiciary Committee, had also been working on a redistricting plan forthe South Carolina Senate. Upon receipt of the passed House Plan and theHouse version of the Congressional Plan, the Senate combined its SenatePlan with the House Plan into H.3003, attached an amended CongressionalPlan, and returned H.3003 to the House on August 22, 2001. The House,after concurring in the Senate amendments, ratified H.3003 and sent thebill to Governor Hodges on August 27, 2001.\n\nThree days later, Governor Hodges returned a veto message for H.3003 tothe General Assembly. The Governor's stated reason for vetoing thelegislatively passed redistricting plan centered on the claim that theHouse and Senate plans should have created more so-called minority\"influence districts,\" defined by the Governor as districts with a blackvoting age population (\"BVAP\") of between 25% and 50%, and a claim thatthe Congressional Plan unnecessarily split several counties within thestate. On September 4, 2001, the House attempted to override theGovernor's veto, but failed by a vote of 73 to 46. Consequently, H.3003was never enacted as law. See S.C. Const. art. IV, § 21 (requiringthat all laws be passed by the General Assembly and signed by theGovernor to be effective, unless two-thirds of both the House and theSenate vote to override a gubernatorial veto).\n\nOur involvement in this uniquely state matter resulted from the filingof three separate lawsuits, all of which allege that the existingelection districts for the South Carolina General Assembly and the UnitedStates Congressional seats in South Carolina violate the \"one-person,one-vote\" requirement of the United States Constitution. See Karcher, 462U.S. at 731; Reynolds, 377 U.S. at 568.\n\nOn September 4, 2001, citizens of Colleton County\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e2\u003c/span\u003e filed suitagainst Glenn F. McConnell, in his official capacity as the President ProTempore of the South Carolina Senate; David H. Wilkins, in hisofficial capacity as the Speaker of the South Carolina House ofRepresentatives, and James H. Hodges, in his official capacity as theGovernor of South Carolina. On September 6, 2001, an action againstMcConnell, Wilkins, and James F. Hendrix, in his official capacityas Executive Director of the State Election Commission, wasbrought by Hugh Leatherman, individually and as Senator fromthe existing 31st Senate District; Scott H. Richardson,individually and as Senator from the existing 46th SenateDistrict; and Robert W. Hayes, Jr., individually and as Senator from theexisting 15th Senate District. On October 1, 2001, plaintiffs KamauMarcharia, James Melvin Holloway, Ann Johnson, and Elder James Johnson,African-American registered voters who reside in South Carolina, broughtsuit against Hodges, McConnell, Wilkins, and Hendrix. And, on October30, 2001, the Chairman of the Georgetown County Council, Sel Hemingway,in his individual capacity, was allowed to intervene in the pending casesand to file a complaint against McConnell, Wilkins, and Hodges.\n\nAlthough each group of plaintiffs seeks to advance its own uniqueinterests, all seek essentially the same broad relief — adeclaration that, based on the population changes revealed by the 2000census, the existing districts for the South Carolina Senate and SouthCarolina House of Representatives are malapportioned in violation of theone-person, one-vote principle of the Fourteenth Amendment to the UnitedStates Constitution, a declaration that the existing districts for SouthCarolina's Congressional seats are malapportioned in violation of ArticleI, § 2 of the United States Constitution, and a declaration that thelegislative redistricting process in South Carolina has reached animpasse, necessitating judicial intervention. Additionally, the partiesseek implementation of interim districting plans by the court for allupcoming elections. All of the pending cases were consolidated anddesignated to be heard before this three-judge panel, appointed pursuantto 28 U.S.C.A. § 2284(a) (West 1994).\n\nDue to the unusual complexity surrounding this type of case, and theskills and expertise which it requires, the court provided early noticeof its intention to appoint a technical advisor to assist the court inunderstanding and utilizing the relevant technology needed to issue anorder in the requisite expedited time frame. See Reilly v. UnitedStates, 863 F.2d 149, 154-56 (1st Cir. 1988). Specifically, the courtnotified all counsel of its intent to appoint Mr. Bobby Bowers, Directorof the South Carolina Budget and Control Board Office of Research andStatistics, as its technical advisor.\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e3\u003c/span\u003e The parties were also asked toadvise the court of any objections to the proposed appointment. No suchobjections were interposed and on November 26, 2001, Mr. Bowers wasappointed in this capacity by order of this court.\n\nFollowing expedited discovery, trial in this matter commenced onJanuary 14, 2002. The trial was conducted in three phases, with the Housephase of the litigation commencing on January 14 and concluding on January18, 2002. Following a week-long recess, trial on the Congressional phaseran from January 29 to January 31, 2002, and trial on the Senate phaseran from February 1 to February 12, 2002. Having considered thevoluminous evidence and testimony presented in these cases, we agree thatthe requested relief is necessary. The existing plans for eachelective body are unconstitutional, necessitating the court'simplementation of court-ordered remedial plans in their place.\n\nII. Remedial Authority\n\nThe results of the 2000 census revealed that South Carolina'spopulation has increased from 3,486,703 persons to 4,012,012 persons overthe past decade, for an overall population growth of 15.1%. Thepercentage of the state's black population has remained relativelyconstant at just under 30% of the total population. The largestpopulation growth occurred in the coastal areas of South Carolina —Horry, Beaufort, Georgetown, and Jasper Counties. With the exception ofGreenville County, the urban counties of the state (Charleston,Greenville, Richland, and Spartanburg) did not keep pace with the 15.1%state-wide growth rate, but areas surrounding some existing urban centers— Lexington County, Kershaw County, and Calhoun County surroundingColumbia; York County and Cherokee County south of Charlotte, NorthCarolina; and Edgefield County and Aiken County near the NorthAugusta/Aiken metropolitan area — did experience substantialgrowth. The rural counties were the hardest hit in population losses.Four counties — Allendale, Bamberg, Marlboro, and Union —lost population, and nine others — Chester, Darlington, Dillon,Fairfield, Lee, Marion, Newberry, Orangeburg, and Williamsburg —did not keep pace with the 15.1% state growth rate.\n\nThese large population shifts from the rural areas to the urban andcoastal areas of the state have resulted in severe malapportionment ofboth houses of the state legislature and of the United StatesCongressional districts. The parties have all stipulated that theexisting plans for all three bodies are unconstitutionally malapportionedafter the 2000 census, see, e.g., Karcher, 462 U.S. at 730-31; Reynolds,377 U.S. at 568, and the court granted summary judgment as to themalapportionment issue in advance of each phase of the trial.\n\nThe primary responsibility for drafting and implementing aredistricting plan in South Carolina always rests with the South CarolinaGeneral Assembly, subject to the approval of the Governor. See U.S.Const. art. I, § 2; S.C. Const. art. III, § 3. \"[J]udicial reliefbecomes appropriate only when a legislature fails to reapportionaccording to federal constitutional requisites in a timely fashion afterhaving had an adequate opportunity to do so.\" White v. Weiser,412 U.S. 783, 794-95 (1973) (quoting Reynolds, 377 U.S. at 586).\n\n[L]egislative reapportionment is primarily a matter for legislative consideration and determination, for a state legislature is the institution that is by far the best situated to identify and then reconcile traditional state policies within the constitutionally mandated framework of substantial population equality. The federal courts by contrast possess no distinctive mandate to compromise sometimes conflicting state apportionment policies in the people's name. In the wake of a legislature's failure constitutionally to reconcile these conflicting state and federal goals, however, a federal court is left with the unwelcome obligation of performing in the legislature's stead, while lacking the political authoritativeness that the legislature can bring to the task. In such circumstances, the court's task is inevitably an exposed and sensitive one that must be accomplished circumspectly, and in a manner free from any taint of arbitrariness or discrimination.\n\nConnor, 431 U.S. at 414-15 (citations and internal quotation marksomitted).\n\nUnfortunately, the elected officials of South Carolina have failed toredistrict the General Assembly and South Carolina's Congressional seatsin accordance with their constitutional obligations. Primary electionsfor Congress and the South Carolina House of Representatives arecurrently scheduled for June 11, 2002, with the general election tofollow on November 5, 2002. All of the parties appearing before us havestipulated, and have presented persuasive evidence, that the GeneralAssembly is at an impasse with the Governor and that there is no chancethat the governing officials will reach a compromise in time for theimpending 2002 elections.\n\nWe too are satisfied that the governing officials cannot complete therequisite redistricting in time for the impending elections.Accordingly, the court is required to take steps \"to insure that nofurther elections are conducted under the invalid plan[s],\" Reynolds, 377U.S. at 585, and to implement remedial districting plans, see Connor, 431U.S. at 415.\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e4\u003c/span\u003e\n\nIII. Remedial Factors\n\nAlthough the court \"perform[s] in the legislature's stead\" when thelatter has failed to redistrict in accordance with the Constitution, seeid., in fact operate under more stringent requirements than those imposedupon the state legislature. Accordingly, we begin with a summary of thespecific redistricting standards under which we operate, each of which isdiscussed in more detail later.\n\nFirst, we look to the federal standards which guide us. Because theconstitutional wrong we remedy is the malapportionment of the existingdistricts, the one-person, one-vote requirement of the United StatesConstitution is always the paramount concern of a court-ordered remedialplan. The plan for redistricting of a state's bicameral legislature \"mustordinarily achieve the goal of population equality with little more thande minimis variation,\" Chapman v. Meier, 420 U.S. 1, 27 (1975), whereasin the congressional redistricting process, a \"good-faith effort toachieve precise mathematical equality\" is required. Karcher, 462 U.S. at730 (internal quotation marks omitted).\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e5\u003c/span\u003e And,in fashioning theseconstitutionally mandated equipopulous plans, the court must comply withthe racial-fairness mandates of § 2 of the Voting Rights Act, 42U.S.C.A. § 1973, and the purpose-or-effect standards of § 5 ofthe Voting Rights Act, 42 U.S.C.A. § 1973c. See Abrams v. Johnson,521 U.S. 74, 90, 96 (1997)\n\nSecond, in satisfying these federally mandated requisites, we look tothe historical redistricting policies of the state, but only insofar as\"those policies do not lead to violations of the Constitution or theVoting Rights Act.\" Abrams, 521 U.S. at 79; see also Upham v. Seamon,456 U.S. 37, 39 (1982) (noting that \"[a]lthough a court must defer tolegislative judgments on reapportionment as much as possible, it isforbidden to do so when the legislative plan would not meet the specialstandards of population equality and racial fairness that are applicableto court-ordered plans\"); White, 412 U.S. at 795 (noting that federalcourts, in the context of reapportionment, \"should follow the policiesand preferences of the State, as expressed in statutory andconstitutional provisions or in the reapportionment plans proposed by thestate legislature, whenever adherence to state policy does not detractfrom the requirements of the Federal Constitution\").\n\nFinally, we reiterate the Supreme Court's admonition that, inimplementing a court-ordered remedial plan for malapportioned legislativeand congressional districts, the court must always act \"circumspectly,and in a manner free from any taint of arbitrariness or discrimination.\"Connor, 431 U.S. at 415 (internal quotation marks omitted). Federalcourts, unlike state legislatures, are not in a position to reconcileconflicting state policies on the electorate's behalf, nor at liberty toengage in political policy-making decisions. See id. We are limited tocorrecting the unconstitutional aspects of the state's plan whilecomplying with the voting Rights Act requirements. To the extent we can,we will also follow traditional state districting principles, but we donot possess the latitude afforded a state legislature to advancepolitical agendas.\n\nTo assist us in our task of implementing a remedial districting planfor each elective body, the parties have presented proposed plans for thetwo bodies of the South Carolina General Assembly and for the sixcongressional districts, which they urge us to either adopt in toto or,at a minimum, to use as templates in formulating our own plans. Indeed,in all phases of the trial, the bulk of the evidence presented wasdevoted to the parties' various redistricting proposals and, inparticular, the issue of which of the proposed plans best complies withthe one-person, one-vote requirement of the United States Constitutionand with the mandates of §§ 2 and 5 of the Voting Rights Act.\n\nWe have carefully reviewed the various plans offered by the parties tothis litigation, and the evidence presented in support of each, and weare satisfied that none are acceptable for wholesale adoption as ajudicially approved redistricting plan. Among a myriad of individualdeficiencies, the evidence overwhelmingly demonstrates one fatal problemthat permeates them all. The General Assembly and the Governor, beingcontrolled by and a member of, respectively, two different politicalparties, have proposed plans that are primarily driven by policy choicesdesigned to effect their particular partisan goals. And, in many cases,the choices appear to be reflective of little more than an individuallegislator's desire to strengthen his or herability to be re-elected to the seat in question.\n\nSimply stated, the General Assembly, in which Republicans hold amajority in both bodies, passed plans that the majority of its membersbelieved were favorable to them, and the incumbent Governor, a Democrat,vetoed those plans in order to advocate the implementation of alterativeplans that are favorable to the views of his political party and itslegislative and congressional members. The Leatherman plaintiffs, all ofwhom are currently members of the Republican Party, have proposed plansthat both advance the Republican Party's agenda in general and strengthentheir individual seats in particular. And, the Marcharia plaintiffs,represented by the American Civil Liberties Union (\"ACLU\"), did notadvance plans of their own, but have either endorsed the plans offered bythe General Assembly, or suggested modifications of their own, which theyfeel best serve the interests of black voters in South Carolina.\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e6\u003c/span\u003e\n\nSuch is the political process. We find it interesting, but are mindfulthat none of the plans carry the imprimatur of the state and that,whatever merit exists for drawing a plan for political reasons or basedupon a particular political ideology,\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e7\u003c/span\u003e it does not exist for us. Whileall parties are entitled to advocate a legislative redistricting planthat furthers their partisan interests, it is inappropriate for the courtto engage in political gerrymandering.\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e8\u003c/span\u003e\n\nAccordingly, the court begins its remedial task of redistricting themalapportioned districts on a equipopulous basis and in the racially fairmanner mandated by the Voting Rights Act. To the extent we cansimultaneously observe districting principles demonstrated to have beenof traditional concern to South Carolina in past redistricting, withoutcompromising our obligations under federal law, we attempt to do so.\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e9\u003c/span\u003eWe are, however, confident in the knowledge that those who disagree withthe plans may seek alternative ones from those in the most appropriateposition to redraw them — the General Assembly and Governor of theState of South Carolina. And, because they are indeed in a betterposition to address the needs of South Carolina and her citizens, weencourage these elected officials, and those who follow in theirfootsteps, to renew and continue efforts to fulfill their constitutionalduties in this respect.\n\nA. Equality of Population and Acceptable Variances; the \"One Person, One-Vote\" Requirement of the United States Constitution.\n\n1. Congressional Reapportionment\n\nThe origin of the constitutional guarantee of \"one-person, one-vote\"for the election of congressional representatives is found in Article I,§ 2 of the United States Constitution. In relevant part, it providesthat \"[t]he House of Representatives shall be composed of Members chosenevery second Year by the People of the several States\" and that such\"Representatives . . . shall be apportioned among the several Stateswhich may be included within this Union, according to their respectiveNumbers.\" U.S. Const. art. I, § 2.\n\nThe provision sets \"a high standard of justice and common sense for theapportionment of congressional districts: equal representation for equalnumbers of people.\" Karcher, 462 U.S. at 730 (internal quotation marksomitted). \"[C]onstrued in its historical context,\" the Supreme Court hasheld, \"the command that Representatives be chosen `by the People of theseveral States' means that as nearly as is practicable one man's vote ina congressional election is to be worth as much as another's.\" Wesberryv. Sanders, 376 U.S. 1, 7-8 (1964) (emphasis added). This standard is ademanding one, \"requir[ing] that the State make a good-faith effort toachieve precise mathematical equality.\" Karcher, 462 U.S. at 730(internal quotation marks omitted); see also White, 412 U.S. at 790.\"[A]bsolute population equality [is] the paramount objective . . . in thecase of congressional districts, for which the command of Art. I, §2, as regards the National Legislature outweighs the local interests thata State may deem relevant in apportioning districts for representativesto state and local legislatures . . . .\" Karcher, 462 U.S. at 732-33.\"Unless population variances among congressional districts are shown tohave resulted despite [a good-faith] effort, the State must justify eachvariance, no matter how small.\" Kirkpatrick v. Preisler, 394 U.S. 526,531 (1969). \"[T]here are no de minimis population variations, which couldpracticably be avoided, but which nonetheless meet the standard of Art.I, § 2, without justification.\" Karcher, 462 U.S. at 734.\n\nSmall population deviations may be justified by legitimate statepolicies such as \"making districts compact, respecting municipalboundaries, preserving the cores of prior districts, and avoidingcontests between incumbent Representatives,\" if the state policies areconsistent with constitutional norms. Karcher, 462 U.S. at 740. \"As longas the criteria are nondiscriminatory, these are all legitimateobjectives that on a proper showing could justify minor populationdeviations.\" Id. (emphasis added) (internal citation omitted). However, astate must \"show with some specificity that a particular objectiverequired the specific deviations in its plan, rather than simply relyingon general assertions.\" Id. (noting that differences in the numbers ofeligible voters and projected population shifts mightjustify small variations in congressional district populations).\n\n2. Redistricting of the South Carolina General Assembly\n\nThe Equal Protection Clause of the United States Constitution requiresthat the seats in both houses of a bicameral legislature — here theSouth Carolina Senate and House of Representatives — also beapportioned on an equipopulous basis. See Reynolds, 377 U.S. at 568. Thisone-person, one-vote principle, established by the Court in Reynolds andgrounded in equal protection, ensures that each person's vote receivesequal weight. See id.\n\nIn all cases, \"the overriding objective [of redistricting] must besubstantial equality of population among the various [legislative]districts,\" Id. at 579. States, however, are permitted somewhat moreflexibility with respect to state legislative apportionment than incongressional districting in order to pursue other legitimate statepolicies, including \"maintain[ing] the integrity of various politicalsubdivisions,\" id. at 578, \"provid[ing] for compact districts ofcontiguous territory,\" id., and recognizing \"natural or historicalboundary lines,\" Swann v. Adams, 385 U.S. 440, 444 (1967). Generally, a\"safe harbor\" exists for legislatively implemented plans achieving lessthan a 10% deviation. See Voinovich v. Quilter, 507 U.S. 146, 161 (1993)(noting that a plan with a maximum deviation under 10% is generallyconsidered to fall within the category of minor deviations); see alsoConnor, 431 U.S. at 418; White v. Resister, 412 U.S. 755, 764 (1973).\n\nCourt-ordered remedial plans for bicameral state legislative bodies, incontrast, are held to a much more stringent standard of populationequality. See Chapman, 420 U.S. at 26. Although not required to attainthe mathematical preciseness required of courts and state legislaturesfor congressional redistricting, see id. at 27 n. 19, a court-orderedplan \"must ordinarily achieve the goal of population equality with littlemore than de minimis variation,\" id. at 27; see also Abrams, 521 U.S. at98; Connor, 431 U.S. at 414. \"[A]ny deviation from approximate populationequality must be supported by enunciation of historically significantstate policy or unique features.\" Chapman, 420 U.S. at 26.\n\nB. The Voting Rights Act\n\nIn exercising our equitable power to redistrict, we must also complywith the requirements imposed upon states by the racial-fairness mandatesof § 2 of the Voting Rights Act, 42 U.S.C.A. § 1973, and thepurpose-or-effect standards of § 5 of the Voting Rights Act, 42U.S.C.A. § 1973c. See Abrams, 521 U.S. at 90, 96 (1997). Indeed, thenumber and composition of majority-minority districts in each proposedplan accounted for the lion's share of the evidence in every phase of thiscase.\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e10\u003c/span\u003e\n\n1. Section 2: The Prohibition Against Minority Vote Dilution\n\nSection 2 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, 42 U.S.C.A. § 1973, wasenactedby Congress \"to help effectuate the Fifteenth Amendment'sguarantee that no citizen's right to vote shall `be denied or abridged. . . on account of race, color, or previous condition of servitude.'\"Voinovich, 507 U.S. at 152 (alteration in original) (quoting U.S. Const.amend. XV). Specifically, § 2 provides that \"[n]o votingqualification or prerequisite to voting or standard, practice, orprocedure shall be imposed or applied by any State or politicalsubdivision in a manner which results in a denial or abridgement of theright of any citizen of the United States to vote on account of race orcolor.\" 42 U.S.C.A. § 1973(a) (West 1994). A violation of § 2\"is established if, based on the totality of circumstances, it is shownthat the political processes leading to nomination or election in theState or political subdivision are not equally open to participation bymembers of [a protected class of citizens] in that its members have lessopportunity than other members of the electorate to participate in thepolitical process and to elect representatives of their choice.\" 42U.S.C.A. § 1973(b) (West 1994) (emphasis added).\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e11\u003c/span\u003e\n\nSimply stated, § 2 prohibits the implementation of an electoral lawthat \"interacts with social and historical conditions to cause aninequality in the opportunities enjoyed by black and white voters toelect their preferred representatives.\" Thornburg v. Gingles, 478 U.S. 30,47 (1986); see also Voinovich, 507 U.S. at 155 (explaining that § 2\"focuses exclusively on the consequences of apportionment. Only if theapportionment scheme has the effect of denying a protected class the equalopportunity to elect its candidate of choice does it violate § 2.\").\n\nIn Gingles, the Supreme Court set forth the specific framework forevaluating a § 2 vote dilution claim.\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e12\u003c/span\u003e Three preconditions mustfirst be established: (1) that the minority group \"is sufficiently largeand geographically compact to constitute a majority in a single-memberdistrict\"; (2) that the minority group is \"politically cohesive\"; and (3)that the majority \"votes sufficiently as a bloc to enable it . . .usually to defeat the minority's preferred candidate.\" Id. at 50-51. Ifthese factors are established, \"the court considers whether, \"on thetotality of circumstances,' minorities have been denied an \"equalopportunity' to `participate in the political process and to electrepresentatives of their choice.'\" Abrams, 521 U.S. at 91 (quoting 42U.S.C.A. § 1973(b)).\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e13\u003c/span\u003e\n\nThe voting strength of a politically cohesive minority group may bediluted by fragmenting the minority voters among districts:\n\nIn the context of single-member districts, the usual device for diluting minority voting power is the manipulation of district lines. A politically cohesive minority group that is large enough to constitute the majority in a single-member district has a good chance of electing its candidate of choice, if the group is placed in a district where it constitutes a majority. Dividing the minority group among various districts so that it is a majority in none may prevent the group from electing its candidate of choice: If the majority in each district votes as a bloc against the minority candidate, the fragmented minority group will be unable to muster sufficient votes in any district to carry its candidate to victory.\n\nVoinovich, 507 U.S. at 153 (emphasis added). Or, minority votingstrength may be diluted by concentrating minority voters within adistrict:\n\nHow such concentration or \"packing\" may dilute minority voting strength is not difficult to conceptualize. A minority group, for example, might have sufficient numbers to constitute a majority in three districts. So apportioned, the group inevitably will elect three candidates of its choice, assuming the group is sufficiently cohesive. But if the group is packed into two districts in which it constitutes a super-majority, it will be assured only two candidates. As a result, we have recognized that \"dilution of racial minority group voting strength may be caused\" either \"by the dispersal of blacks into districts in which they constitute an ineffective minority of voters or from the concentration of blacks into districts where they constitute an excessive majority.\n\nId. at 153-54 (internal alteration omitted) (quoting Gingles, 478U.S. at 46).\n\nAlthough \"[o]n its face, § 2 does not apply to a court-orderedremedial redistricting plan . . ., courts should comply with the sectionwhen exercising their equitable powers to redistrict.\" Abrams, 521 U.S.at 90. Thus, to prevail on a § 2 claim, a plaintiff must demonstratethat, under the totality of the circumstances, the election schemeenacted by a legislature dilutes the minority's voting strength by eitherunnecessarily fragmenting or packing a politically cohesive minoritypopulation. See Vinovich, 507 U.S. at 157; Gingles, 478 U.S. at 46. In thecontextof preparing a court-ordered redistricting plan, we interpret theSupreme Court's command as requiring us to consider the Gingles test aswe draw, paying particular attention to those areas of the state where a\"politically cohesive minority group . . . is large enough to constitutethe majority in a single-member district.\" Voinovich, 507 U.S. at 153. Inthis way, we operate much like the state legislature should, taking stepsto ensure that our plan will not have the effect, albeit unintended, ofdiluting the voting strength of that majority-minority population. SeeAbrams, 521 U.S. at 90-91.\n\n2. Section 5: Avoiding Retrogression\n\nSection 5 of the Voting Rights Act likewise requires us to considerrace in our draw. This provision requires certain covered jurisdictions— those with a history of discrimination against minorities— to obtain either administrative preclearance by the AttorneyGeneral or approval by the United States District Court for the Districtof Columbia for any change in a \"standard, practice, or procedure withrespect to voting.\" 42 U.S.C.A. § 1973c. To obtain preclearance, thecovered jurisdiction must demonstrate that the proposed change hasneither the purpose nor effect \"of denying or abridging the right to voteon account of race or color.\" 42 U.S.C.A. § 1973c; see McDaniel v.Sanchez, 452 U.S. 130, 149 (1981)\n\nEnacted as \"a response to a common practice in some jurisdictions ofstaying one step ahead of the federal courts by passing newdiscriminatory voting laws as soon as the old ones had been struck down,\"Beer v. United States, 425 U.S. 130, 140 (1976) (internal quotation marksomitted), § 5 \"shift[s] the advantage of time and inertia from theperpetrators of the evil to its victim, by freezing election procedures inthe covered areas unless the changes can be shown to benondiscriminatory,\" id. (emphasis added; internal quotation marksomitted). \"[T]he purpose of § 5 has always been to insure that novoting-procedure changes would be made that would lead to aretrogression in the Position of racial minorities with respect to theireffective exercise of the electoral franchise.\" Id. at 141 (emphasisadded).\n\nAlthough they share the goal of addressing the evils of racialdiscrimination, § 5 differs in important respects from § 2 of theVoting Rights Act. First, § 2 applies to all states, whereas § 5applies only to those states, such as South Carolina, which have the worstreputation for historical and ongoing discrimination against blacks.Second, by requiring the creation of majority-minority districts wherevote dilution under the Gingles test would occur, § 2 looks beyondthe status quo to ensure that a redistricting plan affords blacks anequal opportunity to elect the representatives of their choice as whitevoters enjoy. See 42 U.S.C.A. § 1973(b); Gingles, 478 U.S. at 47.Section 5, in contrast, maintains the status quo. It only prevents\"backsliding\" in those jurisdictions subject to its requirements byprohibiting the implementation of any proposed voting change that has beenenacted for a retrogressive purpose, see Reno v. Bossier Parish Sch.Bd., 528 U.S. 320, 335 (2000) (\"Bossier Parish II\"), or that has aretrogressive effect on minority voting strength, see Beer, 425 U.S. at141. Section 5 requires no separate inquiry into the Gingles factors todetermine whether an opportunity district must be created, but \"mandatesthat the minority's [existing] opportunity to elect representatives ofits choice not be diminished, directly or indirectly, by the State'sactions.\" Bush v. Vera,517 U.S. 952, 983 (1996)\n\nThe distinction between § 2 and § 5 was expounded upon by theSupreme Court in Reno v. Bossier Parish School Board, 520 U.S. 471 (1997)(\"Bossier Parish I\"). There, the Court struck down the Department ofJustice's denial of preclearance under § 5 on the basis that the planwas, in the opinion of the Department of Justice, violative of § 2.See id. at 477. This position, the Court held, would \"make compliancewith § 5 contingent upon compliance with § 2,\" and wouldeffectively \"replace the standards for § 5 with those for § 2.\"Id. The Court explained that such an interpretation would contradict its\"longstanding recognition that the two provisions were designed to combatdifferent evils, and, accordingly, to impose very different duties uponthe States.\" Id.\n\nThus, in the redistricting context, Section 5 has a quite limitedsubstantive goal — to insure that the state does not adopt aredistricting plan that, when compared to the existing or \"benchmark\"plan, \"would lead to a retrogression in the position of racial minoritieswith respect to their effective exercise of the electoral franchise.\"Beer, 425 U.S. at 141; see Holder v. Hall, 512 U.S. 874, 883 (pluralityopinion) (\"Under § 5, then, the proposed voting practice is measuredagainst the existing voting practice to determine whether retrogressionwould result from the proposed change.\"); Bossier Parish I, 520 U.S. at478 (explaining that \"the jurisdiction's existing plan is the benchmarkagainst which the `effect' of voting changes is measured\"). Thus,\n\n[i]n § 5 preclearance proceedings — which uniquely deal only and specifically with changes in voting procedures — the baseline is the status quo that is proposed to be changed: If the change \"abridges the right to vote\" relative to the status quo, preclearance is denied, and the status quo (however discriminatory it may be) remains in effect.\n\nBossier Parish II, 528 U.S. at 334.\n\n\"Section 2, on the other hand, was designed as a means of eradicatingvoting practices that minimize or cancel out the voting strength andpolitical effectiveness of minority groups.\" Bossier Parish I, 520 U.S. at479 (internal quotation marks omitted). It involves changes to the statusquo itself. See Bossier Parish II, 528 U.S. at 334. Because adetermination of vote dilution requires \"the existence of an `undiluted'practice against which the fact of dilution may be measured, a § 2plaintiff must also postulate a reasonable alternative voting practice toserve as the benchmark `undiluted' voting practice.\" Bossier Parish I,520 U.S. at 480. Thus, \"the comparison must be made with a hypotheticalalternative: If the status quo results in an abridgement of the right tovote or abridges the right to vote relative to what the right to voteought to be, the status quo itself must be changed.\" Bossier Parish II,528 U.S. at 334 (alterations and internal quotation marks omitted).\n\nBecause South Carolina is a covered jurisdiction under the VotingRights Act, any redistricting plan that it adopts is subject to thepreclearance requirements of § 5. See Allen v. State Bd. ofElections, 393 U.S. 544, 548-49 (1969). A legislative plan still reflects\"the exercise of legislative judgment\" and \"the policy choices of theelected representatives of the people\"; such plans, therefore, remainsubject to preclearance under § 5 even if later reviewedby a court. See McDaniel, 452 U.S. at 153.\n\nGenerally, \"a decree of the United States District Court is not withinreach of Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act such that it must beprecleared,\" Abrams, 521 U.S. at 95 (internal quotation marks andalterations omitted), but \"[t]he exception applies only to judicial plansdevised by the court itself,\" not to legislative plans which aresubmitted to the court by the parties for consideration, id.; see Lopezv. Monterey County, 525 U.S. 266, 286 (1999). Because we haveindependently devised plans for each elective body from scratch,however, none of the plans implemented by this court order are subject tothe preclearance requirements of § 5 and, accordingly, must beimmediately implemented for the upcoming elections.\n\nEven where the court elects to devise its own plan, such that it neednot be precleared. the court must still \"`follow the appropriate § 5standards, including the body of administrative and judicial precedentsdeveloped in Section 5 cases.'\" Abrams, 521 U.S. at 96 (quotingMcDaniel, 452 U.S. at 149). Thus, like state legislatures, we must ensurethat our redistricting plan does not \"lead to a retrogression in theposition of racial minorities with respect to their effective exercise ofthe electoral franchise\" in South Carolina. Beer, 425 U.S. at 141.\n\n3. Equal Protection Constraints Upon The Voting Rights Act Requirements; the Limits of Racial Gerrymandering.\n\nIn complying with the Voting Rights Act in the redistricting context,we must also remain cognizant of the limitations the Fourteenth Amendmentof the United States Constitution imposes upon the permissible use ofrace in the process. The Equal Protection Clause of the United StatesConstitution requires racial neutrality in governmental decision-making.See U.S. Const., amend. XIV, § 1 (providing that no State shall \"denyto any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of thelaws\"). And, the Supreme Court has repeatedly held that dividing votersaccording to their race in the redistricting context is subject to thestrictures of the Equal Protection Clause. See Shaw v. Hunt, 517 U.S. 899,904-05 (1996) (\"Shaw II\"); Miller v. Johnson, 515 U.S. 900, 905 (1995)Shaw v. Reno, 509 U.S. 630, 644 (1993) (\"Shaw I\")\n\nBy prohibiting election plans that have the effect of diluting minorityvoting strength or that lead to retrogression in the position of racialminorities with respect to their effective exercise of the electoralfranchise, however, the Voting Rights Act necessarily forces states toconsider race in the redistricting context, placing the Act in obvioustension with the Equal Protection Clause. The end result is that theVoting Rights Act must always be considered in tandem with the stricturesof the Equal Protection Clause, with the latter operating as a constantlimit upon the degree to which state legislatures — and this courtacting in its remedial capacity — can engage in race-baseddistricting to achieve the goals of the Voting Rights Act.\n\nRace-based classifications, of course, are generally subjected tostrict scrutiny and will pass constitutional muster only if the stateaction is narrowly tailored to achieve a compelling state interest. See,e.g., Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Pena, 515 U.S. 200, 224 (1995). Inthis case, however, we have no occasion to apply strict scrutiny, atleast not in the usual way. Strict scrutiny is aparticularly stringentlevel of judicial review applied to determine the constitutionality of alaw or other action already taken by the state. Because the GeneralAssembly failed to implement redistricting plans, we have no pre-existingplans to which strict scrutiny could be applied. Instead, we are drawingthe plans ourselves, not reviewing plans drawn by the General Assembly.Nonetheless, because our draw is guided by similar limitations as thoseimposed upon states in the redistricting context, the purposes of astrict scrutiny review are of importance in this case as well.\n\na. When does the consideration of race trigger strict scrutiny analysis?\n\nThe Equal Protection Clause, as interpreted by Adarand, would seem tocompel strict scrutiny of any governmental classification based on race.However, the Court has held that strict scrutiny in the redistrictingcontext only applies where \"race was the predominant factor motivatingthe legislature's decision to place a significant number of voters withinor without a particular district.\" Miller, 515 U.S. at 916. Because astate must observe the Voting Rights Act requirements when redistrictingits legislative and congressional districts, such redistricting decisionsnecessarily differ from other types of governmental decision-making:\n\n[T]he legislature is always aware of race when it draws district lines, just as it is aware of age, economic status, religious and political persuasion, and a variety of other demographic facts. That sort of race consciousness does not lead inevitably to impermissible race discrimination. . . . [W]hen members of a racial group live in one community, a reapportionment plan that concentrates members of the group in one district and excludes them from others may reflect wholly legitimate purposes. The district lines may be drawn, for example, to provide for compact districts of contiguous territory, or to maintain the integrity of political subdivisions.\n\nShaw I, 509 U.S. at 646. So long as race is only a consideration,and other traditional districting principles such as compactnessand contiguity are not subordinated to it, the challenged majority-minoritydistrict is not subject to strict scrutiny analysis.\n\nThe question of when race predominates over nonracial factors, therebytriggering strict scrutiny, can be difficult to answer. In cases arisingoutside the redistricting context, \"statutes are subject to strictscrutiny under the Equal Protection Clause not just when they containexpress racial classifications, but also when, though race neutral ontheir face, they are motivated by a racial purpose or object.\" Miller,515 U.S. at 913; see also Id. at 920 (\"[W]here the State assumes from agroup of voters' race that they think alike, share the same politicalinterests, and will prefer the same candidates at the polls, it engagesin racial stereotyping at odds with equal protection mandates.\" (internalquotation marks omitted)). These principles also apply in redistrictingcases. See id. at 914.\n\nStrict scrutiny of a districting plan may also be triggered by anallegation that the state \"adopted a reapportionment scheme so irrationalon its face that it can be understood only as an effort to segregatevoters into separate voting districts because of their race.\" Shaw I, 509U.S. at 658; Miller, 515 U.S. at 916. Thus, \"appearances do matter\" inthe area of redistricting. Shaw I, 509 U.S. at 647. \"Shape is relevantnot because bizarrenessis a necessary element of the constitutionalwrong or a threshold requirement of proof, but because it may bepersuasive circumstantial evidence that race for its own sake, and notother districting principles, was the legislature's dominant andcontrolling rationale in drawing its district lines.\" Miller, 515 U.S. at913.\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e14\u003c/span\u003e\n\nA plaintiff making an equal protection challenge to a redistrictingplan must \"show, either through circumstantial evidence of a district'sshape and demographics or more direct evidence going to legislativepurpose, that race was the predominant factor motivating the legislature'sdecision to place a significant number of voters within or without aparticular district.\" Miller, 515 U.S. at 916.\n\nTo make this showing, a plaintiff must prove that the legislature subordinated traditional race-neutral districting principles, including but not limited to compactness, contiguity, and respect for political subdivisions or communities defined by actual shared interests, to racial considerations. Where these or other race-neutral considerations are the basis for redistricting legislation, and are not subordinated to race, a State can \"defeat a claim that a district has been gerrymandered on racial lines.\"\n\nId. (quoting Shaw I, 509 U.S. at 647). In sum, \"compliance withtraditional districting principles such as compactness, contiguity, andrespect for political subdivisions may well suffice to refute a claim ofracial gerrymandering,\" but does not suffice where \"those factors [a]resubordinated to racial objectives.\" Id. at 919.\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e15\u003c/span\u003e\n\nb. When race predominates in the redistricting context.\n\nThe fact that race has predominated in the decision-making process,however, does not automatically render the district constitutionallyinfirm. Rather, \"[i]f race is the predominant motive in creatingdistricts, strict scrutiny applies and the districting plan must benarrowly tailored to serve a compelling governmental interest\" to passconstitutional muster. Abrams, 521 U.S. at 91; see also Miller, 515 U.S.at 920.\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e16\u003c/span\u003e And, because compliance with the Voting Rights Act is acompelling state interest, states are afforded a very narrow ability tofurther that interest through the consideration of race.\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e17\u003c/span\u003e If thereis \"a strong basis in evidence for concluding that creation of amajority-minority district is reasonably necessary to comply\" with theAct, and the race-based districting substantially addresses theviolation, the plan will not fail under the Equal Protection analysis.See Bush, 517 U.S. at 977 (citations and internal quotation marksomitted); see also Abrams, 521 U.S. at 91.\n\nOf course, to be narrowly tailored to achieve the compelling interestof § 2, there must be evidence that the Gingles test is met in thefirst instance. Section 2 \"does not require a state to create, onpredominately racial lines, a district that is not reasonably compact. Andthe § 2 compactness inquiry should take into account traditionaldistricting principles such as maintaining communities of interest andtraditional boundaries.\" Abrams, 521 U.S. at 91 (emphasis added; internalquotation marks and citations omitted); see also Bush, 517 U.S. at 977(\"A § 2 district that is reasonably compact and regular, taking intoaccount traditional districting principles such as maintainingcommunities of interest and traditional boundaries, may pass strictscrutiny without having to defeat rival compact districts designed byplaintiffs' experts in endless `beauty contests.'\").\n\nIn preparing a redistricting plan in its remedial authority, the courtmust also comply with §§ 2 and 5 of the Voting Rights Act and, wherenecessary, narrowly tailor the draw to do no more than is necessary toserve these compelling stateinterests. The task requires a balancing ofall the relevant inquiries. Avoiding minority vote dilution under § 2may require the creation or maintenance of particular majority-minoritydistricts, even on a predominately racial basis, if this can be done in areasonably compact manner, taking into account traditional districtingprinciples. Avoiding vote dilution does not, of course, require thecreation of a majority-minority district wherever it can be done;indeed, equal protection forbids such a course. See Miller, 515 U.S. at926-27 (rejecting the Department of Justice's position that § 2requires the \"maximization\" of minority voting strength). Bizarrelyshaped districts are not \"narrowly tailored to serve the State's interestin avoiding liability under § 2, because § 2 does not require aState to create, on predominately racial lines, a district that is notreasonably compact.\" Bush, 517 U.S. at 979 (internal quotation marksomitted).\n\nNor does § 5 compel the maximization of black voters in thedistrict. See Miller, 515 U.S. at 927 (\"[T]he Justice Department'simplicit command that States engage in presumptively race-baseddistricting brings the Act . . . into tension with the FourteenthAmendment. . . . There is no indication Congress intended such a farreaching application of § 5, so we reject the Justice Department'sinterpretation of the statute . . . .\" (emphasis added)). To achievenonretrogression in the position of racial minorities, we are permittedto use race as a consideration in the draw, but must narrowly tailor theremedy. \"A reapportionment plan would not be narrowly tailored to thegoal of avoiding retrogression if the State went beyond what wasreasonably necessary to avoid retrogression.\" Bush, 517 U.S. at 983(internal quotation marks omitted).\n\nIn sum, where the Voting Rights Act requires that a majority-minoritydistrict be drawn or maintained, there are points in the drawing of thedistrict where race must predominate, in the sense that we choose to drawthe line in one particular direction over another because of race, thougheither direction would be consistent with traditional districtingprinciples. In these limited situations, race might be said topredominate in the decision-making process at a particular moment, butnever operates to the exclusion of all other districting principles, andeven then we are careful to narrowly tailor our draw so that thispredominate use of race is limited to the accomplishment of the purposesof the Voting Rights Act and no more.\n\n4. Section 2 Considerations: Racially Polarized Voting in South Carolina and the Point of Equal Opportunity.\n\nIn conducting our § 2 inquiry, we must first evaluate the presenceof the Gingles factors. We may not assume that racial bloc voting andminority-group political cohesion exists in a particular area of thestate; rather, these factors must be proven in each case. See Shaw I, 209U.S. at 653.\n\nThe history of racially polarized voting in South Carolina is long andwell-documented — so much so that in 1992, the parties in Burtonstipulated that \"since 1984 there is evidence of racially polarizedvoting in South Carolina.\" Burton, 793 F. Supp. at 1357-58. Thethree-judge court in Smith made a similar finding:\n\nIn South Carolina, voting has been, and still is, polarized by race. This voting pattern is general throughout the state. . . . There is only one exception according to Defendants' expert, Dr. Ruoff, who has studied the voting history of South Carolina for a number of years. He testified, \"Whites almost always vote for whites and blacks almost always vote for blacks unless the candidate is a black Republican and then never.\"\n\nSmith, 946 F. Supp. at 1202-03. The court also noted the widesocio-economic gap between white and black voters, as evidenced by, amongother things, the disparity in unemployment rates, household income,education, and access to private transportation. See id. at 1203.\n\nIn this case, the parties have presented substantial evidence that thisdisturbing fact has seen little change in the last decade. Voting inSouth Carolina continues to be racially polarized to a very high degree,in all regions of the state and in both primary elections and generalelections. Statewide, black citizens generally are a highly politicallycohesive group and whites engage in significant white-bloc voting.Indeed, this fact is not seriously in dispute.\n\nDr. John Ruoff, who was retained by the Southern Poverty Law Center forthe purpose of conducting an extensive analysis of racially polarizedvoting patterns in South Carolina during the last ten years,\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e18\u003c/span\u003e hasappeared again to testify regarding his findings and conclusions about thecontinued racially polarized voting in South Carolina. Specifically, heoffered undisputed testimony that South Carolinians are still verydivided in terms of where they live and that elections throughout SouthCarolina continue to be marked by very high levels of racial polarizationin voting. Black voters are generally politically cohesive and whitevoters almost always vote in blocs to defeat the minority's candidate ofchoice. Racial polarization is highest in black-white elections —those involving a black candidate running against a white candidate.And, there is a well-documented hierarchy in the preference of blackvoters. With few exceptions, black voters demonstrate an overwhelmingpreference for black Democrats as their representatives, followed by whiteDemocrats, particularly in a general election, but black voters virtuallynever vote for a Republican candidate. The other experts retained by theparties in this case substantially concurred in this portion of Dr.Ruoff's opinion, which was likewise supported by the statistical andother evidence presented to the court by all of the parties.\n\nBy way of summary, the evidence revealed that in black-white, singleseat elections, the median level of black voters voting for blackcandidates was 98% in general elections and 86% in primary contests.Although white voters will cross over to vote for black candidates at arate of 21% in general elections, they will cross over to vote for ablack candidate in primary elections at a rate of only 8%. In addition,voter mobilization among blacks in general elections is lower than amongwhite residents, but greater in black-majority districts.\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e19\u003c/span\u003e\n\nIn addition, the ACLU provided extensive documentation of the historyof voting-related racial discrimination in South Carolina, which wassubmitted largely as astipulation among the parties. Evidence of thedepressed socio-economic and educational status of blacks in the statewhich hinders their ability to participate effectively in the politicalprocess and to elect representatives of their choice was alsopresented.\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e20\u003c/span\u003e\n\nThis evidence overwhelmingly demonstrates that the first two Ginglesfactors, necessary for the creation of majority-black legislative andcongressional districts in areas where minorities are sufficiently largeand geographically compact to constitute a majority in a single-memberdistrict, are present statewide. Minority voters are generallypolitically cohesive to a very high degree and, as a rule, the majorityusually votes sufficiently as a bloc to defeat the minority's preferredcandidate. See Gingles, 478 U.S. at 51. Thus, we can and should considerrace in each of our redistricting plans to ensure that they do not havethe unintended effect of diluting the voting strength of a reasonablycompact, majority-minority population.\n\nThe measure that must be used to ensure that the compact,majority-minority population actually has an \"equal opportunity\" to electthe candidate of its choice in a particular district, on the other hand,is often in sharp dispute. We measure equal opportunity by the percentageof minority voting age population necessary for the minority voters toelect the candidate of their choice, see Johnson v. Miller,922 F. Supp. 1556, 1568 nn.18 \u0026 19 (S.D. Ga. 1995) (noting that minorityvoting age population is the appropriate measure for analyzing votedilution and that the alternative use of black registered voterpercentages condones voter apathy), aff'd sub nom. Abrams v. Johnson,521 U.S. 74 (1997), which seems to create little controversy. The actualpercentage required in a particular district, and how that percentage isreached, are much different matters.\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e21\u003c/span\u003e\n\nDr. Ruoff testified on behalf of the General Assembly defendants onthis subject as well. He testified that state-wide black voters are onlyable to elect candidates of their choice in majority-black or very nearmajority-black districts. In addition to the high levels of voterpolarization, this is in part because black political mobilization islower than white political mobilization overall, but higher in districtswhere black candidates have a strong opportunity to be elected. In otherwords, blacks in a majority-black district are aware of their opportunityand tend to register and turn out to vote in districts that aremajority-black or very near majority-black. Dr. James W. Loewen, whotestified on behalf of theSenate in the Senate phase of thislitigation, generally concurs in this view as well.\n\nDavid Epstein, an expert favoring the Governor's proposed House andSenate plans, does not share this view. Using a new technique called\"probit analysis\" (which he professes to have pioneered), Dr. Epsteintestified that the point of equal opportunity for the state as a wholeoccurs at just over 47.11% BVAP. By region, Dr. Epstein opined that theUpstate's point of equal opportunity is 44.61%, the Midlands' is 47.45%,the Pee Dee's is 48.19%, and the Low Country's is 45.58%. Dr. Epsteinalso testified that once a district exceeds approximately 40% BVAP, theaddition of more black votes does not alter the particularrepresentative's voting patterns; Democrats of both races support theminority-favored position in General Assembly votes. This is because,according to Dr. Epstein, blacks now turn out in numbers roughlyequivalent to whites, there is white cross-over voting at about 20%, anda black's tendency to vote against a minority candidate is only about2%. For these reasons, Epstein testified, redistricting plans drawn tolower BVAP levels, by allowing for the draw of influence districts, willbetter advance the substantive representation of the black community inSouth Carolina.\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e22\u003c/span\u003e\n\nHaving carefully considered all of the expert testimony offered by theparties on these important issues, as well as the supporting documentationbehind their views, we find that in order to give minority voters anequal opportunity to elect a minority candidate of choice as well as anequal opportunity to elect a white candidate of choice in a primaryelection in South Carolina, a majority-minority or very nearmajority-minority black voting age population in each district remains aminimum requirement.\n\nSection 2 requires the court to consider whether, \"`on the totality ofcircumstances,'\" a plan will deny minority voters \"an `equal opportunity'to \"participate in the political process and to elect representatives oftheir choice.'\" Abrams, 521 U.S. at 91 (quoting 42 U.S.C.A. §1973(b)). The evidence presented overwhelmingly demonstrates that, with rareexceptions, blacks currently prefer to be represented first by blackDemocrats. In the absence of either the choice, such as in a primary, orthe opportunity, due to percentages too low to outvote a cohesivemajority bloc vote, blacks prefer to be represented by white Democrats.Equal opportunity does not equate to a guarantee of success, but it doesrequire an equal opportunity to elect the minority's candidate of choicewhich, in South Carolina, is almost always a minority candidate. In sum,the Voting Rights Act protects the minority voters' opportunity to electtheir candidate of choice, not just a minority incumbent and not just theminority's opportunity to elect an incumbent of any race. Rather, aminority's equal opportunity to elect acandidate of choice must includethe opportunity to elect a minority candidate of choice, and since aminority candidate cannot win the seat without having an equalopportunity to win the party primary, equal opportunity must be measuredat every step in the electoral process. The precise point of equalopportunity, however, must always be evaluated on a district by districtbasis.\n\n5. Section 5 Considerations in South Carolina; the Benchmark Plan and the Measure of Retrogression.\n\nIn order to ensure that our plan complies with § 5 of the VotingRights Act, we must first identify the \"benchmark\" plan from which tomeasure any retrogressive effect of our actions. See Bossier Parish I,520 U.S. at 478. As a general premise, the benchmark plan for purposes ofmeasuring retrogression is the last \"legally enforceable\" plan used inthe jurisdiction. 28 C.F.R. § 51.54 (b)(1) (providing that the last\"legally enforceable\" plan is the benchmark plan for purposes ofmeasuring retrogression); see Holder v. Hall, 512 U.S. 874, 883-884(1994). A potential problem arises, however, due to the well-documenteduse of racial gerrymandering during the 1990s round of redistricting tomaximize black representation. See, e.g., Abrams, 521 U.S. at 80; Smith,946 F. Supp. at 1185. The Governor asserts that this \"max-black\" policyhas resulted in an unnecessarily high black voting age percentage in mostmajority-minority districts. In Abrams, however, the Supreme Courtreiterated that the last legally enforceable plan used by thejurisdiction is to serve as the baseline for comparison in a § 5retrogression analysis. See Abrams, 521 U.S. at 96-97; see also BossierParish II, 528 U.S. at 334 (noting that \"[i]n § 5 preclearanceproceedings — which uniquely deal only and specifically withchanges in voting procedures the baseline is the status quo that isproposed to be changed: If the change abridges the right to vote relativeto the status quo, preclearance is denied, and the status quo (howeverdiscriminatory it may be) remains in effect\" (internal quotation marksomitted)); Holder, 512 U.S. at 883-84 (\"The baseline for comparison ispresent by definition; it is the existing status. While there may bedifficulty in determining whether a proposed change would causeretrogression, there is little difficulty in discerning the two votingpractices to compare to determine whether retrogression would occur.\");Smith, 946 F. Supp at 1209 (noting that \"any benchmark . . . should bethe last plan that was legally adopted by the General Assembly that hasnot been set aside by the court or superseded by action of the GeneralAssembly that has not been altered by the court\"). And, in January 2001,the Justice Department released its guidelines for redistricting, takingthe position that an actual \"finding of unconstitutionality under Shaw\"would be a prerequisite to rejecting the last legally enforceable plan asthe benchmark. Guidance Concerning Redistricting \u0026 Retrogression, 66Fed. Reg. 5412, 5412 (Jan. 18, 2001).\n\nWe hold that, so long as a current district or plan has not beenformally declared to be the product of an unconstitutional racialgerrymander under the principles of Shaw and its progeny, it will serveas the benchmark for measuring retrogression. The determination that aparticular district is the product of a racial gerrymander is afact-intensive inquiry and no Shaw challenge to any district has beenbrought in these proceedings. Furthermore, any such benchmark districtshave now been declared unconstitutional under the one-person, one-votestrictures of the Equal Protection Clause, and a Shawinquiry would unnecessarily embroil this court in extended mini-trials overthe moot issue of whether the district is constitutionally infirm for otherreasons as well.\n\nThis conclusion does not, however, equate to a requirement that we mustaccept the configuration of the existing districts. The benchmark has nodirect effect upon the constraints we now know to be imposed by the EqualProtection clause. The fact that a suspect district has not been formallydeclared unconstitutional does not affect our duty to draw districts inaccordance with the goals of the Voting Rights Act and the principlesenunciated by the Supreme Court in Shaw and its progeny. Those principlesoperate in tandem to require us to \"clean up\" cores of existingmajority-minority districts should the application of federal law andtraditional state districting principles now dictate a somewhat differentconfiguration. If, in fact, the prior district was gerrymandered toachieve an unnecessarily — and indeed unconstitutionally —high percentage of black voting age population, the constraints of ourcurrent remedial factors will necessarily bring that percentage down to amore acceptable and reasonable level.\n\nThe question of how retrogression should be measured and evaluated inthe 2000 redistricting process is a more difficult one. In January 2001,the Department of Justice issued its Guidance Concerning Redistrictingand Retrogression Under Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act. According tothe Department:\n\nA proposed plan is retrogressive under the Section 5 \"effect\" prong if its net effect would be to reduce minority voters' \"effective exercise of the electoral franchise\" when compared to the benchmark plan. The effective exercise of the electoral franchise usually is assessed in redistricting submissions in terms of the opportunity for minority voters to elect candidates of their choice. The presence of racially polarized voting is an important factor considered by the Department of Justice in assessing minority voting strength. A proposed redistricting plan ordinarily will occasion an objection by the Department of Justice if the plan reduces minority voting strength relative to the benchmark plan and a fairly-drawn alternative plan could ameliorate or prevent that retrogression.\n\n. . . [The state] bears the burden of demonstrating that a less-retrogressive plan cannot be reasonably drawn . . . .\n\n. . . If it is determined that a reasonable alternative plan exists that is non-retrogressive or less retrogressive than the submitted plan, the Department will interpose an objection.\n\n66 Fed. Reg. at 5413 (Jan. 18, 2001) (emphasis added; internal citationomitted). Although § 5 \"does not require jurisdictions to violate theone-person, one-vote principle\" or \"to violate Shaw v. Reno and relatedcases,\" the Department concludes that § 5 \"may require thejurisdiction to depart from strict adherence to certain of itsredistricting criteria.\" Id. By way of example, the Department advisesthat state criteria that \"require the jurisdiction to make the leastchange to existing district boundaries, follow county, city, or precinctboundaries, protect incumbents, preserve partisan balance, or in somecases, require a certain level of compactness of district boundaries mayneed to give way to some degree to avoid retrogression.\" Id.\n\nIn accordance with these precedents, the standard of nonretrogressionprohibits our implementation of a plan that will diminish the existingopportunity for minority voters to elect the candidate of their choice ina particular district if afairly-drawn alternative exists that would nothave that effect. However, \"[n]onretrogression is not a license for theState to do whatever it deems necessary to ensure continued electoralsuccess it merely mandates that the minority's opportunity to electrepresentatives of its choice not be diminished, directly or indirectly,by the State's actions.\" Bush, 217 U.S. at 983.\n\nAccordingly, for purposes of § 5, we must consider race inredistricting where necessary to avoid retrogression. To do so, wefirst examine the court plan to ensure that it does not unfairlyretrogress the overall position of minority voters by reducing thetotal number of majority-minority districts in the benchmark planand, secondly, to ensure that it does not unnecessarily reduce theopportunity of minority voters to elect their preferred candidatein a particular district, where meaningful comparisons can be made.See Abrams, 521 U.S. at 97.\n\nBecause we must narrowly tailor any race-based changes designed toprevent retrogression in the minority's voting strength, however, we donot arbitrarily strive to achieve any benchmark BVAP, which onlyrepresents the current BVAP in a malapportioned district. The history ofrace-based districting by state legislatures and courts in the early1990s to maximize the drawing of majority-minority districts withoutregard to whether there was in fact a geographically compact minoritypopulation in the area, believed to be both constitutional and required bythe Department of Justice policies, is well-documented. We have notexamined individual districts to determine whether we believe they wereracially gerrymandered because we do not think that inquiry isappropriate at this stage, nor have the parties proffered evidence whichwould be sufficient to establish any such finding. But, we do recognizethat this may explain, at least in part, why the court, operating underits currently known constraints, cannot constitutionally achieve theexisting BVAP in a fairly-drawn district. Additionally, unavoidablereductions in the BVAP percentages have resulted in some areas because ofincreased residential integration. While the 2000 census reveals that thepercentage of minorities remained constant, minorities have moved awayfrom historically black neighborhoods, resulting in substantialpopulation deviations in existing majority-minority districts. Nearly allof the existing majority-minority districts need population and, toremain a majority-minority district, need predominately blackpopulation. The residential integration of blacks and whites revealed bythe 2000 census results is an encouraging sign in South Carolina. But ifit has any downside, it is that it makes it more difficult for courts andstate legislatures to add the concentrations of black populationnecessary to replace the concentrations lost in predominately black areasto avoid retrogression without engaging in bizarre draws.\n\nCognizant of these constraints on our task, we consult the benchmarkBVAP in each of the proposed majority-minority districts, and weigh italong with the other factors that affect the ultimate goal of avoiding adraw that causes an unnecessary diminution of the effectiveness of amajority-minority district. In sum, the court plans avoid retrogressionby preserving the number of electable black majority districts in thecurrent plan, and preventing the unnecessary reduction of BVAP in thoseeffective majority-minority districts, within the parameters of the EqualProtection Clause, the Voting Rights Act, and traditional districtingprinciples.\n\nC. Traditional Districting Principles\n\nWe turn now to the \"traditional districting principles\" of the state.We mustconsider these principles along with the federal mandates imposedby the one-person, one-vote requirement of the Equal Protection Clauseand the racial fairness and nonretrogression principles of the VotingRights Act, but we apply them only to the extent that they do notconflict with the federal principles. See Abrams, 521 U.S. at 79; Upham,456 U.S. at 39.\n\nGenerally speaking, traditional redistricting principles in SouthCarolina have directed courts to maintain, where possible, recognizedcommunities of interest and the cores of existing districts, as well aspolitical and geographical boundaries delineated within the state. SeeSouth Carolina State Conference of Branches of the NAACP v. Riley,533 F. Supp. 1178, 1180 (D.S.C.), aff'd, 459 U.S. 1025 (1982). Thisincludes maintaining county and municipal boundaries where possible, andprotecting the cores of existing districts by altering old plans only asnecessary to achieve the requisite goals of the new plan. See id. at1180-81.\n\nMaintaining the residences of the incumbents who serve those coreconstituents within the district is also a districting principle thathistorically has been observed in South Carolina. See id. Although thisis usually referred to as \"incumbency-protection,\" we view the principleas more accurately protecting the core constituency's interest inreelecting, if they choose, an incumbent representative in whom they haveplaced their trust. Provided it does not conflict with other nonpoliticalconsiderations such as communities of interest and compactness, it is oneworthy of consideration by this court. See, e.g., Bush, 517 U.S. at 964(\"[W]e have recognized incumbency protection, at least in the form ofavoiding contests between incumbents, as a legitimate state goal.\")internal quotation marks and alteration omitted)); Johnson, 922 F. Supp.at 1565 (noting the protection of incumbents as a legitimateconsideration, albeit an inherently more political one).\n\nMetropolitan areas that overflow county boundaries, such asCharleston/Berkeley/Dorchester, Greenville/Spartanburg, andRichland/Lexington. previously have been recognized as sharing a specialcommunity of interest. See Riley, 533 F. Supp. at 1181. And, of course,South Carolina has traditionally adhered to the principle that \"districtsshould be as compact as reasonably possible\" and \"that districtboundaries are not gerrymandered to dilute the voting strength ofminorities,\" id.\n\nThe amount of deference owed to the historical districting principle ofmaintaining county boundaries, and the position it holds in the hierarchyof pertinent considerations, was the subject of a fair amount of disputeat trial. In the 1980s redistricting process, the three-judge court inRiley noted the State's \"substantial interest in the preservation ofcounty lines,\" primarily \"because the residents of a county have acommunity of interest.\" Id. at 1180. As noted then, county residents \"areaccustomed to voting together for county officials. There is muchadministrative convenience in drawing district lines along county lines,and it facilitates the process of organizing constituencies andcampaigning for the support of constituents.\" Id. The Riley court,however, did. not elevate the respect for county lines to the level ofexcluding all other factors. Rather, it likewise noted the state'shistorical concern for preserving the core of existing districts andprotecting the incumbents who serve them, the state's recognition of othernon-county-based communities of interest, the need for compactdistricts, and the principle of racial fairness. See id. at 1181.\n\nTen years later, the three-judge court in Burton seemed to elevate theimportance of maintaining county lines. There, the court stated that, \"inthe quarter century since Reynolds the General Assembly has consistentlystated, through its plans and specific statements of policy, that amongvarious state policies, preserving county lines should enjoy a preeminentrole in South Carolina's redistricting process. This preeminence ishighly rational.\" Burton, 793 F. Supp. at 1341. Although the Burton courtstated that the preservation of county lines was \"[t]he only cognizablestate policy [it] considered,\" id. at 1360, the court split 27 of thestate's 46 counties in its Senate plan. Ultimately, Burton was summarilyvacated by the Supreme Court and remanded for \"further consideration inlight of the position presented by the Solicitor General in his brief forthe United States filed May 7, 1993.\" Statewide Reapportionment AdvisoryComm. v. Theodore, 508 U.S. 968, 968 (1993). The Solicitor General hadmaintained that the three-judge court failed to apply a proper analysisunder § 2 of the Voting Rights Act and, as a part of that failure,placed undue emphasis upon preserving county and precinct lines.\n\nWe likewise recognize South Carolina's strong preference for minimizingthe splits of counties within her borders. Many governmental services,such as fire and police protection, are organized along politicalsubdivision lines, and counties and cities are often representative of anaturally existing community of interest. See Burton, 793 F. Supp. at1341 \u0026 n. 29; Riley, 533 F. Supp. at 1180. We also understand the desireexpressed by county representatives, particularly those in smallcounties, to remain \"whole\" in a district, or a substantial part of adistrict, in order to maximize their voice on a state level.\n\nNevertheless, we are also cognizant of the evidence that the trend ofpopulation movement continues to be from small rural counties tourban/suburban and coastal counties, and that often the cost of keepingsmall counties \"whole\" or their splits minimal is to increase the numberof splits in more populated counties. Furthermore, as demonstrated by thetestimony and other evidence presented to us in this proceeding, theprinciple of preserving county lines, while accorded much importance, hasnot been an inviolate policy or even a superior policy in all districts.Different parts of a county may also lack commonality of interest, mostnotably those counties located in coastal and metropolitan regions of thestate which are now divided rather starkly upon rural/resort orrural/urban lines.\n\nFinally, we note that it has long been recognized that \"[t]he policy ofmaintaining the inviolability of county lines . . ., if strictly adheredto, must inevitably collide with the basic equal protection standard ofone person, one vote.\" Connor, 431 U.S. at 419. These population shiftsand the stringent deviation to which we are held make maintaining countylines a more difficult goal for the court to achieve, particularly in thecontext of the smaller House districts, than for the state's electedofficials who possess more latitude in this regard.\n\nFor these reasons, we agree that we must honor South Carolina'simportant and longstanding state policy of maintaining countyboundaries, but only insofar \"as that can be done without violation ofthe [one-person, one-vote] principle of Wesberry v. Sanders andconsistently with other state interests.\" Riley, 533 F. Supp. at 1180.Like all traditional districting principles adhered to by the statelegislature, the principle of preserving county lines occupies asubordinate role to the federaldirectives embodied in the United StatesConstitution and the Voting Rights Act when the court is called upon toimplement remedial redistricting plans. We do not find that thepreservation of county lines continues to enjoy a preeminent role in thecourt's redistricting task. It is required to be considered as animportant, guiding principle in our decision and, where appropriate,accorded great, but not necessarily greater, weight.\n\nHaving considered the history of redistricting in South Carolina andthe evidence of traditional districting principles presented in thisproceeding, we find that the traditional districting principles andexisting redistricting policies observed in South Carolina direct usfirst and foremost to remedy the population deviations in existingdistricts by maintaining the core of those districts present in themalapportioned plan, while adding or subtracting population in a compactand contiguous manner to achieve the population equality required by theConstitution. In doing so, we consider all of the districting principleshistorically observed by the state. Generally speaking, however, we findthat the cores in existing districts are the clearest expression of thelegislature's intent to group persons on a \"community of interest\"basis, and because the cores are drawn with other traditional districtingprinciples in mind, they will necessarily incorporate the state's otherrecognized interests in maintaining political boundaries, such as countyand municipal lines, as well as other natural and historical communitiesof interest.\n\nIV. The South Carolina House of Representatives\n\nA. Background\n\nThe South Carolina House of Representatives consists of 124 memberselected from single-member districts, see S.C. Const., art. III, §3. to serve two-year terms, see S.C. Const., art. III, § 2. Prior tothe Supreme Court's one-person, one-vote mandate enunciated in Reynoldsv. Sims, 377 U.S. 533 (1964), the House was apportioned to counties basedon population, but each county received at least one representativeregardless of population. See Smith, 946 F. Supp. at 1177 (detailing thehistory of legislative reapportionment since Reynolds); see alsoO'Shields v. McNair, 254 F. Supp. 708, 709-11 (D.S.C. 1967) (invalidatingthe South Carolina Constitution's method of apportioning the GeneralAssembly as violative of the one-person, one-vote principle).\n\nIn the 1980s, the House successfully redistricted itself without courtintervention. However, in 1992, the legislature reached an impasse withthe Governor, who believed additional majority-minority districts wererequired by § 2 of the Voting Rights Act, resulting in acourt-ordered plan. See Burton, 793 F. Supp. at 1340. The Burton courtdetermined that the state would follow a predominate policy ofmaintaining county lines and held that, due to the exigency of the timepressures caused by a pending election schedule, it need not conduct afull § 2 Voting Rights Act inquiry. See id. at 1341, 1353. TheSupreme Court summarily vacated and remanded the case to the districtcourt \"for further consideration in light of the position presented bythe Solicitor General in his brief\" to the Court. See StatewideReapportionment Advisory Comm. v. Theodore, 508 U.S. 968 (1993). Aspreviously noted, the Solicitor General had argued that the district courtplaced undue emphasis upon the maintenance of county lines and gaveinadequate consideration to the requirements of § 2 of the VotingRights Act. More particularly, the Solicitor General argued that thedistrict court did notadequately address the question of whetheradditional compact and contiguous districts with black majorities shouldbe created to avoid dilution of black voting strength and that thedistrict court lacked an appropriate basis to conclude that a bare 50%majority-black voting age population should be automatically considered a\"black opportunity district\" for purposes of § 2 of the Voting RightsAct. See Smith, 946 F. Supp. at 1181. Two weeks later, the Supreme Courtissued its decision in Shaw v. Reno, 509 U.S. 630 (1990), which denouncedthe use of racial gerrymandering to create majority-minority districtsunder § 2.\n\nIn 1994, the legislature successfully passed and precleared aredistricting plan for the House. However, nine of those districts weresubsequently challenged as being racially gerrymandered in violation ofthe Shaw/Miller principles. Following a trial before a three-judgedistrict court panel, six of the nine districts were held to be theproduct of an unconstitutional gerrymander. See Smith, 946 F. Supp. at1210. In 1997, the General Assembly passed a House plan which correctedthe unconstitutional districts struck down by the court in Smith, whichthe parties agree is the most recent, legally enforceable House plan.\n\nAs noted previously, the parties agree that the current House districtsare malapportioned and, therefore, constitutionally infirm under theone-person, one-vote strictures of the Equal Protection Clause. Applyingthe 2000 census numbers, South Carolina's total population of 4,012,012persons, split between the existing 124 House districts, compels a targetpopulation for each House district of 32,355 persons. The existing Houseplan has a total population deviation of 95%, with District 118 at -38.21%below the ideal district population and District 79 at 56.79% over theideal district population.\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e23\u003c/span\u003e\n\nThe malapportionment is pervasive. By way of example, House District79, located in the suburban area of Columbia in northeastern RichlandCounty and southern Kershaw County, is the most populated house districtin the state, with a total population of 50,729, resulting in a deviationof 56.79%. Without regard to the deviations in adjoining or other nearbydistricts, District 79 requires the removal of more than 18,000 personsfrom the district to achieve population equality — over half thepopulation needed for a single district. Similar areas of large growthinclude the Greenville-Spartanburg area, Lexington County, and thesuburbs of Charleston, as well as the beach communities of Horry Countyand Beaufort County.\n\nHouse District 118, the former home of the now-closed Charleston NavalBase, demonstrates the opposite problem. Located in the heart ofCharleston, it, like many other urban-based house districts, has becomeextremely underpopulated, and it also experiences the additional problemof being surrounded by other underpopulated urban-based districts.Consequently, District 118 is now the least-populated house district,with a total population of 19,992, for a deviation of -38.21%. In orderto bring it into population compliance, District 118 would require theaddition of more than 12,000 persons — nearly half the populationneeded for a single district — from surrounding districts whichthemselves are severely underpopulated.\n\nB. The Proposed Plans\n\nDuring the House phase, four plans were proposed to the court: H.3003,which was passed by the state legislature, but vetoed by GovernorHodges; Governor Hodges' plan, which was submitted as an amendment to theHouse plan, but overturned on the floor; a plan submitted by ColletonCounty, which was also submitted to the House but overturned on thefloor; and a plan submitted to us by Georgetown County. The bulk of theevidence presented by the House and the Governor consisted ofexplanations of why this court should not adopt and implement the planssubmitted by the other. By way of summary, the House charged the Governorwith preparing a plan that racially gerrymandered districts to increasethe BVAP percentages in predominately white districts to between 25% and50%. These so-called \"influence districts,\" the House charges, aredesigned to promote the election of white Democratic candidates and theconcomitant ousting of white Republican incumbents, at the expense ofreducing BVAP percentages in existing majority-minority districts tomarginal levels.\n\nThe Governor charges the House with a converse racial gerrymanderingargument, asserting that H.3003's version of the House plan wasintentionally drafted to \"racially polarize\" the state. Specifically, theGovernor points to a handful of House representatives and charges thatthey intentionally gerrymandered their districts on a racial basis, oftenwith the assistance of racial \"dot-density\" maps, by moving one or twopredominately black precincts out of their Republican-controlled districtand into a majority-minority or otherwise Democrat-controlled district.The effect, the Governor charges, was the intentional \"bleaching\" ofRepublican districts at the expense of existing minority influencedistricts.\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e24\u003c/span\u003e The Governor also asserts that his proposed plan adheresmore closely to traditional districting principles in South Carolina andmaintains more closely the cores of existing districts than does thelegislatively passed House plan.\n\nThe ACLU initially proposed three alternative plans, but does not nowadvocate the plans for adoption by this court. Although they submittedthe plans as illustrative of plans that satisfy the Voting RightsAct,\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e25\u003c/span\u003e the ACLU asserts that they only seek to ensure that any planadopted by the court is in compliance with the racial-fairness standardsof § 2 and the nonretrogression standards of § 5. They furtherassert that all of the proposed plans satisfy the nonretrogressionstandard of § 5 and that the House plan, with minor modifications ina few majority-minority districts (particularly Districts 12, 102 and116), is acceptable from a § 2 standpoint. Finally, the ACLUspecifically denounced the Governor's advocation of \"influence districts\"both as a policy matter and, given its partisan-based origin, as a validconsideration for this court in the draw.\n\nColleton County and Georgetown County advance more local concerns.Under the present 1997 plan, Colleton County is divided among five Housedistricts, comprising a majority in none. The House and Governor bothpropose to now splitColleton County into four House districts, whichColleton County also opposes. Colleton County asks to be split into nomore than three House districts. Additionally, Colleton Countyspecifically opposes the House plan's proposal to separate the 742 personson Edisto Beach from their neighbors on Edisto Island in District 119,and move them to the predominately Charleston-based District 116, whichis contiguous only by water. Colleton County asserts that the split isunconstitutionally race-based, whereas the House asserts that the splitwas motivated by a coastal community of interest.\n\nGeorgetown County contests the decision of the House and Governor tosplit the City of Georgetown between House Districts 103 and 108.Georgetown contends that the City of Georgetown shares a strong communityof interest with the coastal portion of Georgetown County and shouldtherefore remain wholly within District 108. The decision to dootherwise, Georgetown charges, represents an unconstitutional, race-basedgerrymander, performed with the exclusive intent to maintain HouseDistrict 103 as a majority-minority district in derogation of all othertraditional districting principles.\n\nHaving reviewed the evidence and testimony received, the courtconcludes that none of the proposed plans comply with the criteriarequired of a judicially drawn plan. First, the House and the Governorhave submitted plans which exceed the range of de minimis populationdeviation and, therefore, could not be adopted by this court even if theywere to survive the preclearance process under the Voting Rights Act.Neither disputes this fact. The House plan has a total deviation of 4.86%and the Governor's plan has a total deviation of 3.13%. The other planssubmitted are likewise beyond an acceptable range of deviation for acourt-ordered plan.\n\nSecond, the plans are of limited utility as a template to guide us. Forthe most part, the House and Governor have opted to attack each other'splan as being race-based and politically motivated. The evidence bearsboth sides out; both plans plainly represent the culmination of veryspecific political and, in some cases, individual agendas. It iswell-documented in the evidence, and indeed not in dispute by theparties, that black citizens in South Carolina vote almost unanimously forDemocratic candidates against Republican candidates and, in a primary,for black Democrats against white Democrats. Given this high level ofracial polarization and high correlation between black voters and theDemocratic Party which currently exists, it is hardly remarkable thatwhen one places a pen in the hands of incumbents to draw their owndistricts, a Republican might draw fewer blacks in the district tomaximize \"its Republican base; a white Democrat might draw more blacks inthe district to increase its Democratic majority, but not so many as tobe threatened with defeat by a black challenger; and a black Democratmight draw enough blacks in the district as necessary to ensurere-election. In view of the mandate that race must be of at least someconsideration given the high levels of racial polarization in the state,we find it most difficult to determine whether and when the incumbents'proper motives gave way to improper ones.\n\nFortunately, we need not do so. In some areas of the state, we wereable to consult the submitted plans for common, and thereforenoncontroversial ground, although this assistance is limited in thoseparts of the state that experienced substantial population disparity. Inthis limited manner, unenacted legislative andgubernatorial plans wereconsidered as evidence of state policy, but always with a healthy regardfor each party's highlighting of the opponent's political motivations. Ineach case, we consulted both, but we ultimately found it necessary todraw the districts largely from scratch, in accordance with our owninterpretation of the remedial factors that govern us in our draw.\n\nC. The Court's Plan\n\n1. Population Equality\n\nBecause our primary charge is to remedy the malapportionment present inthe existing plan, we were guided in our remedy by traditionaldistricting principles, seeking to preserve the core of each existingdistrict where possible, and adding or subtracting population surroundingthe core in a compact and contiguous manner. In doing so, we remainedmindful of the existing majority-minority districts which §§ 2 and 5of the Voting Rights Act compel us to respect, as well as any additionalareas that the § 2 inquiry would direct us to protect frominadvertent vote dilution.\n\nBecause the substantial shifts in population alone would inevitablycause major change to the district cores in some areas, we began ourcharge with the question of whether we should collapse any existing Housedistricts that have experienced extreme population loss and relocate themas new districts in areas of extreme population growth. In this regard,at least, we found the proposed plans to be of substantial benefit.\n\nBoth the House and the Governor agreed that the population shifts inSouth Carolina require the relocation of two House districts. Bothproposed to collapse two existing districts in or near the areas of thestate with the greatest population loss. They also agreed that theexplosive population growth in the coastal counties of Horry and Beaufortcalled for the creation of one new House district in each. Horry Countygrew by 52,576 persons, a 36.5% increase in population, and BeaufortCounty grew by 34,512 persons, a 39.9% increase in population.\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e26\u003c/span\u003e\n\nWe agreed that two house districts must be collapsed and relocatedelsewhere. Unless we collapsed and moved districts to account for thesubstantial population losses in the Pee Dee and downtown Charleston areaand the substantial population growth in Horry County and BeaufortCounty, gross disruption of the cores of all existing districts wouldhave \"rippled\" throughout the Pee Dee and Low Country regions of thestate. See e.g., Johnson, 922 F. Supp. at 1563 (noting that theappropriate place to locate Georgia's new congressional district was thehigh population growth area near Atlanta). By collapsing districts inthose areas of greatest population loss, population is freed up to berelocated to adjoining districts, which were also low in population.Similarly, by relocating these districts to the areas of greatestpopulation gain, we minimized the \"ripple\" effect of the population gainsin the other area districts.\n\nOf course, this determination led us to the difficult question ofexactly which two districts in the existing plan should be collapsed, andwhere those districts should be relocated. Like the House and Governor,we found that the most logical places to locate new districts were in theareas where the most population growthoccurred — Horry County andBeaufort County. And, when we moved to these areas to locate the newdistricts, the cores of each new district naturally landed in the areasof those counties that, in fact, experienced the most growth.\n\nAlthough the parties agreed that two districts should be collapsed andmoved, they disagreed as to which two specific districts should becollapsed. The parties did agree that an existing district must becollapsed in the Charleston area (which grew only 5.0%) and moved to theBeaufort area as described above, but disagreed as to which district inCharleston should be collapsed. The House, which is currently controlledby the Republican Party, proposed the collapse of District 113 inCharleston County, whereas the Governor, a Democrat, proposed thecollapse of District 119 in Charleston County. The parties whollydisagreed as to the specific area of the state where the second districtshould be collapsed. The House proposed the collapse of District 80 inRichland County, an area which grew at 12.0%, whereas the Governorproposed the collapse of District 67 in Sumter County, an area which grewat only 3.3%. Unsurprisingly, the House proposed the collapse of twoDemocratic districts and the Governor proposed the collapse of twoRepublican districts.\n\nIn order to maintain as much as possible the cores of the remainingdistricts in the area, the court found that a district must be collapsedin the Charleston area, which experienced the second greatest overallpopulation loss, in large part due to the closure of the Charleston NavalBase in the 1990s. The court rejected, however, both parties' proposeddistrict for collapse. Instead, the court found that the most logicaldistrict to collapse in Charleston County was District 118, the districtthat experienced the greatest negative population deviation in theCharleston area (38.21%) and, indeed, statewide.\n\nWith regard to the second district to be collapsed, the court rejectedthe House proposal to collapse District 80 in Richland County, which wasonly 7.29% low in population, as opposed to the Governor's proposal tocollapse a district in Sumter County. Collapsing a district in RichlandCounty would result in the unnecessary shift of districts in the Midlandsarea of the state, which has not experienced a population loss as awhole, whereas the Pee Dee area experienced the largest overall negativepopulation deviation in the state. However, the court rejected theGovernor's proposal to collapse District 67 in the Pee Dee, whichexperienced a population deviation of -13.14%. Instead, we found thatDistrict 68 was the most logical district to collapse because it, likethe district we collapsed in Charleston, experienced the highest negativepopulation deviation in its area (-17.94%).\n\nHaving made these difficult threshold decisions, we then turned to ourtask of drawing equipopulous districts. There, we began to draw thedistricts in a compact and contiguous manner, identifying at the outsetthe core of each existing district and moving about its borders to add orsubtract compact and contiguous areas of population as the individualdistrict dictated. This approach not only served the goal of minimalchange and constituency consistency in the individual district, itcreated the least amount of \"ripple\" effect in other districts. Wherepossible, and where the decision was not outweighed by other competinginterests, we attempted not only to avoid new county splits, but to alsoeliminate existing county splits to the extent possible. Our plan doesnot create any county or city splits that were not already present in thebenchmark plan, although it does eliminate several splits that didexist.Beyond this, we were motivated by an attempt to follow natural andother easily identifiable boundaries, such as major roads, to create asmooth district border that election officials could easily pinpoint.\n\nIn the end, the court's plan achieves the requisite populationequality, with a total de minimis deviation of plus or minus one percentvariation, see, e.g., Chapman, 420 U.S. at 26-27, and results in theleast change in terms of constituency movement. The plan contains threeless total county splits than the 1997 benchmark plan and, as compared tothe proposed plans of the House and Governor, the court plan containsseven less total county splits and nine less total county splits,respectively. With the exception of Districts 67 and 113, which adjoinedthe two collapsed districts, the court plan also does not pit anyincumbents against one another. Finally, we note that the split ofColleton County has been reduced from five to three splits, and theconstituents of Edisto Beach remain with their Edisto Island neighbors inDistrict 121. And, being in agreement with the position that the City ofGeorgetown shares a strong community of interest with the coastal portionof Georgetown County, the court does not split the City of Georgetown,which remains wholly within District 108.\n\n2. The Voting Rights Act\n\nAs noted previously, in carrying out our remedial task of devising andimplementing a redistricting plan, the court is also directed to considerthe requirements imposed upon South Carolina by the Voting Rights Act.For purposes of § 5, the House and Governor agree that the\"benchmark\" plan is the current 1997 plan with the 2000 census numbersapplied to it. Although the ACLU urges us to also consult the 1997 planwith the 1990 census numbers applied to it for comparison, they agreethat both parties have drawn reasonable districts for purposes of theVoting Rights Act. The 1997 plan with the 1990 census numbers contains 32majority-minority districts. As a result of the population losses andshifts revealed by the 2000 census results, the benchmark plan nowcontains only 25 majority-minority districts.\n\nPrior to trial, the parties agreed that no § 5 issues werepresented by the plans proposed by the Governor or House because eachproposed majority-minority districts in excess of the 25 districts in thecurrent benchmark plan. The Governor's plan proposed 28 majority-minoritydistricts, whereas the House plan proposed 27 majority-minoritydistricts. The ACLU's illustrative plan contained 32 majority-minoritydistricts, but was not drawn in accordance with traditional districtingprinciples, and the ACLU agrees that the numbers presented by the Governorand House are sufficient to avoid retrogression. Although we did notelect to adopt a submitted plan, the court-drawn plan, which also exceedsthe 25-district benchmark, raises no retrogression issues under § 5.\n\nThe court plan also complies with § 2 of the Voting Rights Act. Inpreparing the new districting plan, we considered every existingmajority-minority district present in the benchmark plan, as well asother areas pointed out to us by the parties as ones that § 2 mightrequire. First, in keeping with our paramount goal for every existingdistrict — save District 118 in which population deviationcompelled a collapse — we attempted to maintain the core of eachexisting majority-minority district. With few exceptions, these districtsrequired the addition of population to achieve the one-person, one-voterequirement. And, in every case, we examined the geographic territorysurrounding theexisting minority district to determine whetheradditional concentrations of minority voters were present in a compactand contiguous area such that we could achieve the concurrent goals ofequalizing population, avoiding retrogression, and preserving traditionaldistricting principles. Where we believed it necessary to honor theprinciples established in the Shaw/Miller line of cases, we eliminatedlines that, although never challenged, appeared to us to possibly be theresult of the 1990s racial gerrymandering or that otherwise did notcomport with the identified traditional districting principles.\n\nSecond, we considered those districts that were not majority-minorityunder the benchmark plan, but that one or more parties urged us toconsider under § 2. If the minority population existed in areasonably compact area, otherwise met the Gingles test,\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e27\u003c/span\u003e and couldbe drawn utilizing traditional districting principles, it was drawn as amajority-minority district. House Districts 12 and 82, for example, felleasily into this category. The minority population in each area issufficiently compact and has a sufficiently strong community of interestto require its draw as a § 2 district. District 103, in contrast,could have been drawn as a majority-minority district if we had split theCity of Georgetown. The Governor and the House did so, placing its BVAPabove the 50% mark. We declined to do so. The proposed split violated thestrong community of interest between the residents of the City ofGeorgetown and its coastal neighbors. The court did not split municipalboundaries elsewhere in the plan, unless they were already split or weresplit on a county line or where municipal population size mandated asplit. And, the loss of the district as a majority-black one did not causea net retrogressive effect.\n\nAlthough in drawing a majority-minority district applying traditionaldistricting principles, the court might have produced a district wherethe BVAP exceeds the percentage necessary to be considered an \"equalopportunity\" district under § 2, the court did not allow race topredominate so as to remove the excess black voters to create an\"influence\" district elsewhere. We protected the status of an equalopportunity district and prevent retrogression where we must, as we arecompelled to do by the mandates of the voting Rights Act. Beyond thatmandate, however, the lines were drawn wherever traditional districtingprinciples led us without the consideration of race. Although demographicchanges did not always allow for a constitutionally appropriate draw thatreached the benchmark BVAP in every district, there is no net loss ofmajority-minority districts in the state-wide plan and the black votingage population in every district closely approximates that percentagewhich the parties agreed was sufficient to be both a minority opportunitydistrict under § 2 and nonretrogressive under § 5.\n\n3. The Specific Majority-Minority House Districts\n\nWe turn now to the specific majority-minority districts present in thecourt plan. As noted previously, the Governor's plan proposes 27majority-minority districts, whereas the House plan proposes 28majority-minority districts. The court-drawn plan contains 29majority-minority districts. As to each, we make the following additionalfindings.\n\nFirst, the parties agreed that twenty-one districts — Districts23, 25, 31, 49, 50, 51, 57, 59, 62, 66, 70, 73, 74, 76, 77, 82, 91,95, 101, 109, and 121 — all satisfied the Gingles test and thatthe proposed plans had all been drawn to a level sufficient to provideblack voters an equal opportunity to elect the candidates of their choice.This was confirmed by Dr. Ruoff in his testimony. In addition, Dr. Ruofftestified that Districts 111 and 122, while in danger of losing theiropportunity status due to anticipated development, also met the Ginglestest and were drawn to provide the requisite equal opportunity. We agreethat the cores of these districts are located in areas that satisfy theGingles test and, while not adopting either plan's iteration in full, thecourt's draw of these districts accomplishes similar levels ofopportunity.\n\nThe draws of two districts — Districts 41 and 64 — in theproposed plans are, according to Dr. Ruof if, at questionable levels to becalled \"equal opportunity\" districts, but cannot be drawn at a higherBVAP level without racially gerrymandering. Having determined that theareas do meet the Gingles factors, the court's plan maintains thesedistricts as majority-minority and at a level similar to that proposed bythe parties and which the court believes will be sufficient to providethe black voters an equal opportunity.\n\nAccording to Dr. Ruoff, three districts — Districts 102, 103,and 116 — are drawn to a marginal level of equal opportunity bythe proposed plans, but should be maintained as majority-minoritydistricts. Having considered the areas in conjunction with otherdistricting principles, the court agrees that Districts 102 and 116meet the Gingles factors. Under the court plan, they contain BVAPlevels that approximate those proposed by the parties and that thecourt believes is sufficient to provide an equal opportunity. Asnoted previously, District 103 could not be drawn to the proposedlevel of equal opportunity without violating the existing communityof interest between the residents of the City of Georgetown and theGeorgetown County coastal community; therefore, it falls just shyof a majority-minority district.\n\nFinally, Dr. Ruof if testified that District 118 was in seriousjeopardy and that District 12 was a questionable equal opportunitydistrict. As previously noted, the court found that District 12 could andshould be maintained as an equal opportunity district, and the court hasdrawn that district accordingly. However, for the reasons previouslydiscussed, the court weighed all of the relevant considerations andconcluded that the severe population variance in District 118 and itssurrounding districts dictated that it be collapsed and relocated to anarea of substantial population growth in Beaufort County. As a result ofthat collapse, however, District 113 recouped much of its populationshortfall from the constituents of the collapsed District 118, causingits BVAP to increase from 32.15% to 50.11%, which we also believeprovides the minority constituents in that area an equal opportunity toelect the candidate of their choice. Consequently, the number ofmajority-minority districts in this area suffered no loss.\n\nV. The South Carolina Senate\n\nA. Background\n\nThe South Carolina Senate consists of 46 members elected fromsingle-member districts. See S.C. Const., art. III, § 1; State exrel. McLeod v. West, 153 S.E.2d 892, 894 (S.C. 1967). Prior to Reynolds'one-person, one-vote mandate, each of South Carolina's 46 counties wasentitled to elect one senator to serve a four-year term. See S.C.Const., art. III, § 6; see also Smith, 946 F. Supp. at 1177;O'Shields, 254 F. Supp. at 711. In Burton, the three-judge panelimplemented a court-drawn plan for the Senate, see Burton, 793 F. Supp.at 1358-63, a plan thatwas subsequently vacated by the Supreme Court.See Statewide Reapportionment Advisory Comm., 508 U.S. at 968. TheBurton court plan had created eleven black-majority districts, ten ofwhich had a majority-black voting age population. See Burton, 793 F.Supp. at 1362. On remand, the General Assembly passed a new redistrictingplan for the Senate, which received approval from the Department ofJustice and became law. See Smith, 946 F. Supp. at 1181, 1201-02. Thislegislatively drawn plan created 12 black-majority districts. See id. at1203.\n\nHowever, in Smith, three of those districts — Districts 29, 34and 37 — were subsequently declared to be the product of anunconstitutional gerrymander. See Smith, 946 F. Supp. at 1210. In 1997,the General Assembly passed a Senate plan to remedy the unconstitutionalSenate districts. It is the plan currently in use and, therefore, is thelast legally enforceable Senate plan. The current plan, applying either1990 or 2000 census numbers, contains 10 majority-minority districts.\n\nAs with the House districts, it is undisputed that the existing Senatedistricting plan is now malapportioned. Based on the state's totalpopulation of 4,012,012, the ideal Senate district would have a populationof 87,218 people. The total deviation of the existing Senate districts is48.16%, with District 46 overpopulated by 21.15% and District 43underpopulated by 27.01%. Nine of the ten majority-minority districts inthe Senate benchmark plan, measured by total black population, aresubstantially low in population.\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e28\u003c/span\u003e\n\nB. The Proposed Plans\n\nDuring the Senate phase, six plans were proposed to the court: H.3003'sversion of the Senate plan, which was passed by the legislature, butvetoed by Governor Hodges; two plans prepared by Governor Hodges,designated Plan A and Plan B; one plan proposed by Leatherman; one planproposed by Colleton County; and one plan proposed by Georgetown County.The ACLU proposed an illustrative plan as well, but now place their fullsupport behind the Senate version of the Senate plan, asserting that itfully complies with the one-person, one-vote requirements of theConstitution and the Voting Rights Act. As in the House case, the bulk ofthe evidence presented was designed to encourage this court to adopt theplan of the advocate and to point out the improprieties of the otherplans.\n\nThe Senate asserts that its plan better serves the goals of leastchange, compactness, preserving communities of interest and countylines, and accommodating incumbents where practical. The Senate alsocharges that the Governor's plan cannot be adopted because it faciallyviolates § 5 of the voting Rights Act by reducing the overall numberof effective majority-minority districts under the existing plan and byreducing the effectiveness of individual majority-minority districts bydeliberately removing black population from majority-black districts andmoving theminto adjacent districts. The effect, as alleged by theSenate, is the deliberate reduction of the BVAP in majority-minoritydistricts below the point of equal opportunity in order to createso-called \"influence districts\" — majority white districts whereblacks cannot elect their candidate of choice, but will substantially aidin the election of a white Democratic candidate over a Republicancandidate. While the Senate asserts that such influence districts mayhave merit from a purely political standpoint, i.e., to increase theprobability that the Democratic party will be able to oust incumbentRepublicans and regain control of the South Carolina Senate, it assertsthat political goal cannot be achieved at the expense of retrogressingother districts and that this court cannot engage in such a politicaldesign. Simply stated, the court cannot draw a plan that intentionallyaids one political party at the expense of another.\n\nThe Governor, for his part, charges that the Senate plan is raciallyand politically gerrymandered for the purpose of \"bleaching\"Republican-held districts and rendering them \"safe\" Republicandistricts. As before, this generally amounts to the converse of theSenate's argument that the Governor has racially gerrymandered districtsto achieve the opposite result. By increasing the BVAP percentage inRepublican-held districts, the Governor increases the probability of awhite Democrat ousting the Republican incumbent in the general election,but at the expense of lowering the BVAP in an adjoining majority-minoritydistrict and the concomitant ability for blacks to elect a black Democratin that district over a white Democrat. By increasing the BVAP in currentmajority-minority districts, the Senate Republicans avoid that result andmake the adjoining \"superwhite\" districts Republican strongholds.Leatherman has also proposed a Senate plan that generally advances theRepublican point of view, basing communities of interest upon votes castfor a particular candidate. Again, these are political arguments that wecannot and do not endorse, and involve issues that are not appropriatefor our consideration in the draw.\n\nColleton County asserts, as before, the importance of county lines toour inquiry. The Senate Plan splits Colleton County into threedistricts, District 38, 39 and 45. Noting that the approximately 38,000people in Colleton County could fit within one senate district (and eventhen not hold the majority), they ask us to consider their plan forsplitting Colleton County into only two districts, Districts 38 and 45.\n\nGeorgetown County is divided between Senate District 32, located westof the City of Georgetown in a more rural part of the County, andDistrict 34, located on the coastal side of the County. Essentially,Georgetown's plan advocates a proposal that maintains the core ofDistrict 34 along the coast of Georgetown, with Georgetown as the hub orcore. As part of its proposal, Georgetown also advocates the retention ofthe City of Georgetown in District 34, based upon the assertion that itshares the coastal-based community of interest (fishing, beach andenvironmental concerns in particular) with the other parts of thatdistrict.\n\nAgain, we have carefully considered the plans proposed by all of theparties, but conclude that none comply fully with the criteria that governa court-drawn plan. As was the case in the House phase of thislitigation, the evidence presented demonstrated that political policiesand goals were the driving force in determining the draws of the planssubmitted by the Senate, Leatherman, and the Governor. In particular, wenote that while we may consider race to the extent authorized by theVoting Rights Act — to avoid minority vote dilution andretrogression — we are aware of no authority, and have been pointedto none, that would permit us to draw district lines based upon whatamounts to political policy decisions as to who best can represent thewishes of minority voters. Accordingly, this court has drawn its own planin accordance with the criteria that guide us, consulting the proposedplans for common ground where possible.\n\nC. The Court's Plan\n\n1. Population Equality\n\nFirst, the court plan satisfies the one-person, one-vote standardrequired by the Equal Protection clause. As we did in the House case, thecourt generally sought to maintain the cores of the existing districts,adding or subtracting compact and contiguous population as individualdistrict requirements dictated to correct the population deviations. Thedistrict-wide plan has a total de minimis variation of plus 0.96% andminus 0.85%. And, the plan does not pit any incumbents against each otherin the same districts.\n\n2. The Voting Rights Act\n\nThe parties agree that none of the proposed plans run afoul ofthe requirements of § 2 of the Voting Rights Act. Neither does thecourt plan. Rather, the application of § 5 of the Voting RightsAct to the Senate districts is the source of the dispute.\n\nAll proposed plans, save those of the Governor, maintain the currentbenchmark of nine majority-minority districts, plus District 7, at levelssufficient to provide the minority voters an equal opportunity to electtheir preferred candidate. The Governor's proposed plan maintains onlyeight majority-minority districts, plus District 7, at a level of equalopportunity, which the others contend is retrogressive.\n\nMore specifically, all of the proposed plans maintain Districts 19,21, 30, 32, 36, 39, 42, and 45 as majority-minority districts —that is, each district has a BVAP that exceeds the 50% mark — andat levels that each plan's advocate believes to be sufficient to providethe minority voters an equal opportunity to elect the candidate of theirchoice.\n\nTwo other districts — District 7 in Greenville and District 17 inthe Chester/Fairfield area — have historically beenmajority-minority opportunity districts under the existing plan, butcannot be maintained as such. Under the benchmark plan, just over 50% ofthe total population of District 7 is black, but the current BVAP fallsjust below the 50% mark. Additionally, the district has lost so muchpopulation (-15.06% deviation) that the parties agree it can no longer bedrawn with at least 50% total black population or black voting agepopulation, without improper racial gerrymandering. However, all partiesagree that the BVAP in District 7 is still high enough for it to be anequal opportunity district and the district is currently represented by ablack incumbent. District 17 has a total population and BVAP in excess of50% under the benchmark plan, but also suffers from a substantialpopulation shortage (-12.77%). However, it is obvious that it can nolonger be drawn with a BVAP over 50% or as one of equal opportunitywithout unconstitutionally gerrymandering the district.\n\nThe Senate plan, however, would add black voting age population toDistrict 40, located in the Orangeburg area, to make it amajority-minority district where blacks have an equal opportunity toelect the candidates of their choice. Although the Governor's planproduces a district with only 46.96% BVAP, Senator Brad Hutto, theDemocratic Senator who currentlyrepresents District 40, encouraged thecourt to increase District 40's BVAP to over 50%.\n\nMinority Districts 30, 32 and 36 generated the greatest amount ofdiscussion. All located in the Pee Dee area and currently low inpopulation, they surround the Republican-held District 31 in Florence.While most of the submitted plans keep these districts at a BVAP level of58% to 59%, the Governor's plan reduces the BVAP in District 30(currently represented by a minority candidate) from 58.69% to 52.00%;reduces the BVAP in District 32 (which has never elected a minoritycandidate) from 58.27% to 50.93; and reduces the BVAP in District 36(which also has never elected a minority candidate) from 58.37% to52.46%. As a result, it appears, the Governor's plan can maintain, andeven slightly increase, the BVAP percentage in District 31 from 29.58% to31.91%, compared to the Senate's BVAP percentage of 22.34%.\n\n3. The Specific Senate Majority-Minority Districts\n\nThe court-drawn plan contains nine majority-minority districtsdeveloped from the cores of the existing districts, plus District 7, atsufficient levels to afford the minority voters an equal opportunity toelect their preferred candidate. All of these districts were drawn usingthe state's traditional districting principles along with considerationof the compact and contiguous black population in and adjoining the coresof those districts.\n\nEight of the nine majority-minority districts in the court plan aredrawn as majority-minority districts in both the Senate and Governor'splans; they are Districts 19, 21, 30, 32, 36, 39, 42, and 45. Also, likethe Senate and Governor, the court plan does not attempt to maintainDistrict 17 as a majority-minority district given the overwhelmingevidence that it cannot be done in a manner to ensure equal opportunitywithout racially gerrymandering the district. Thus, the only substantialdifference in this respect lies in the court's draw of District 40 as amajority-minority district, as the Senate plan did, in order to bothprevent retrogression in the state-wide voting strength of blacks and toprotect the naturally compact voters within the area from the dilution oftheir voting strength.\n\nThe BVAP of each preexisting majority-minority district in the courtplan was reduced somewhat from the benchmark plan, this being causedprimarily by the existence of abnormally high levels of black populationestablished by the previous gerrymandering of the district lines and bythe subsequent loss in population within the districts. However, we aresatisfied that the BVAP for each district in the court's plan is the bestthat could be reached consistent with our responsibilities under theVoting Rights Act and other districting principles. And, we are confidentthat the BVAP levels are sufficient in each district to provide theminority voters of each an equal opportunity to elect the candidate oftheir choice. In reaching these conclusions, we have carefully consideredthe voluminous expert testimony and statistical evidence presented tous, and note that, with one exception, the BVAPs in the court planclosely approximate or exceed the points of equal opportunity arrived atby each expert.\n\nThe one exception is District 36, located in the Pee Dee area of thestate. Both the Senate and the House draw the district as amajority-minority district, but differ substantially on the BVAP levelnecessary to render it an equal opportunity district. The Governor'sexpert, Dr. Epstein, opined that a district in the Pee Dee regiongenerally requires a BVAP of only48.19% to give black voters an equalopportunity, and the Governor draws the district at 52.46% BVAP. Dr. Ruoffand Dr. Loewen, on the other hand, both testified that the districtneeded a BVAP in excess of 57% to give minority voters an equalopportunity to elect a minority candidate of their choice, but base thisconclusion on a demonstrated lack of cohesion among the black voters inthat district in the last several elections. Everyone acknowledges,however, that District 36 is currently represented by a popular andlong-serving white Democratic senator.\n\nWe agree with the parties that District 36 should be maintained as amajority-minority district. However, the experts' analyses of theelection data clearly reveals that District 36 is atypical for SouthCarolina and, in particular, for the Pee Dee region of South Carolina inthat blacks are crossing over in sufficient numbers to vote with a highlypolarized white community to elect a white incumbent over a blackchallenger. Nevertheless, the district is currently a majority-minoritydistrict in the benchmark plan, and the racial composition of thepopulation residing there and traditional districting principles naturallyled to District 36 remaining a majority-minority district. Additionally,we view the lack of cohesion in the black community as induced by theyears of faithful constituent service by the long-serving whiteDemocratic senator, and we question the testimony that an extraordinarilyhigh BVAP is necessary to make District 36 one in which minorities havean equal opportunity to elect the candidate of their choice for purposesof the Voting Rights Act. We must remember that the question is not whatBVAP would be necessary to defeat a popular incumbent; the question iswhat BVAP is required to insure that the minority population has an equalopportunity to elect a minority candidate of choice in an open election.We are convinced by the testimony that the bloc voting by black citizensthat has been demonstrated to exist in South Carolina generally and inother parts of the Pee Dee area in particular would also occur inDistrict 36 during an open election and, therefore, that a BVAPconsistent with that required in other parts of the Pee Dee is proper.Accordingly, we believe the BVAP that exists under the court's plan,55.15%, also will be sufficient to make this an opportunity district forminorities in an open election.\n\nThe court plan also draws District 40 as a majority-minority district.District 40 previously had a BVAP of 48.73%, almost enough to make it amajority-minority district. The black population in this highly polarizedarea is sufficiently large and geographically compact to satisfy theGingles test, and this population coupled with traditional districtingprinciples quite naturally led to its being drawn as an opportunitydistrict. We are also satisfied that the BVAP we establish (51.02%)will, based upon the expert testimony of Dr. Loewen, make this districtone of equal opportunity. And, by drawing District 40 as an opportunitydistrict, we avoid the retrogression in the total number of suchdistricts state-wide that the loss of District 17 would otherwise cause.\n\nIn sum, there is no impermissible retrogression in the court's Senateplan. The number of majority-minority seats, measured by black voting agepopulation, remains the same as in the benchmark plan. And, the changes invoting strength reflected in the BVAP for each district, caused by ourcorrection of the likely racial gerrymandering of the 1990s and thesubsequent drops in population, are minor and do not represent adiminution of the effective voting strength of the minority population inthose areas. Consequently, in our judgment, § 5 of the Voting RightsAct has been satisfied. Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act has also beensatisfied. The only new district required by § 2 has been created.Additionally, we have weighed the testimony and verified that the BVAPsin all of the majority-minority districts and in District 7 aresufficient for minorities to have an equal opportunity to elect thecandidate of their choice.\n\nVI. The United States House of Representatives\n\nA. Background\n\nBased upon the results of the 2000 census, South Carolina is entitledto keep its six seats in the United States Congress. With a totalpopulation of 4,012,012, the ideal congressional district should contain668,669 persons. Four of South Carolina's six existing districts areoverpopulated: the First District is overpopulated by 16,096; the SecondDistrict is overpopulated by 62,353; the Third District is overpopulatedby 1,470 persons; and the Fourth District is overpopulated by 1,666persons. The Fifth District is underpopulated by 13,144 persons. The SixthDistrict, which is South Carolina's only existing majority-minoritydistrict, is severely underpopulated by 68,443 persons. The partiesconcede that all of the existing congressional districts aremalapportioned based upon the 2000 census, and therefore in violation ofArticle I, § 2 of the Constitution, and that the General Assembly andGovernor are at an impasse in the redistricting process.\n\nB. The Proposed Plans\n\nA number of plans have been submitted for consideration by the court.First, the House and Senate have a joint legislatively passed plan (the\"General Assembly plan\"), which was vetoed by the Governor; the Governorhas offered two proposed plans; Leatherman has offered two proposedplans; and Colleton County has offered a proposed plan. The GeneralAssembly plan and the plans proposed by Leatherman all have a totaldeviation of plus or minus one person. The Governor's plan deviates fromplus nine to minus eleven persons.\n\nWith regard to the Voting Rights Act requirements, the parties agreethat there remains a single possibility for a majority-minoritycongressional district in South Carolina — the existingmajority-minority Sixth Congressional District, which has as its core thesubstantial and predominately black populations in the Pee Dee area andin portions of adjoining Richland and Charleston Counties. The SixthDistrict, which is currently represented by the Honorable James Clyburn(the only African-American congressional incumbent in South Carolina),has a current BVAP, based upon the 2000 census population, of 57.78%. Allparties agree that the Voting Rights Act requires the maintenance of thissingle district as a majority-minority district in South Carolina, andall proposed plans incorporate the core areas of the current district.The dispute among the parties arises over the specific lines that shouldencompass constituents of the Sixth Congressional District.\n\nThe General Assembly plan achieves a BVAP in the Sixth District of54.12%. To resolve the severe population loss in the district, theGeneral Assembly plan proposes to eliminate the current split in ColletonCounty between the Second and Sixth Districts and to place the countyentirely in the Sixth District. The splits of Orangeburg and CalhounCounty between the Second and Sixth Districts are maintained. The splitsof Lee County and Darlington County between the Fifth and Sixth Districtsare removed, but Sumter County, in the Pee Dee, and Richland Countyremain split, as do Dorchester, Berkeley, and Charleston Counties.Georgetown County is also split in the General Assembly plan.\n\nThe Governor has proposed two congressional redistricting plans:Governor's Plan A and Plan B. The two plans are nearly identical,achieving BVAP percentages of 53.05% and 53.01%, respectively. Both plansreflect the Governor's desire to eliminate the existing splits ofOrangeburg County and Calhoun County between the Second and SixthDistricts and to place those counties entirely within the SixthDistrict, as well as the Governor's desire to avoid a split of GeorgetownCounty. To accomplish these goals, the Governor eliminates the split ofColleton County, but places it whole within the Second District. Like theGeneral Assembly plan, the Governor eliminates the splits of Lee Countyand Darlington County, but maintains the splits in Sumter County,Richland County, Dorchester County, Berkeley County, and CharlestonCounty. However, the Governor's plans also move the Savannah River Sitein Aiken County from its home in the Third District to the SecondDistrict. And, Governor's Plan B, at the apparent request of CongressmanClyburn, proposes the relocation of Fort Jackson, the largest militaryinstallation in South Carolina, from its present home in the SecondDistrict, which is currently represented by Congressman Joe Wilson, tothe Sixth District, which is currently represented by CongressmanClyburn.\n\nBoth of Leatherman's plans make dramatic changes to the Second, Fifth,and Sixth Congressional Districts. Designated the \"Court E Plan\" and \"NoRetrogression Plan,\" the plans achieve a BVAP percentage of 56.57% and58.37%, respectively. They are admittedly partisan-based draws, designedto maximize the election of Republican candidates. For the same reasons,they are inconsistent with this court's goal of achieving populationequality with the minimal effect upon the status quo. While we haveconsidered these plans, we find them to be of quite limited utility to usin our draw.\n\nFinally, Colleton County has appeared for the sole purpose ofadvocating that the County, which is currently split between the SecondDistrict and the Sixth District, be kept wholly within one congressionaldistrict in the court-imposed plan. Prior to the court-drawn plan ofBurton, Colleton County was placed wholly within the First District.However, Colleton County takes no position as to which district it wouldprefer to be placed within, so long as it is placed within it whole.\n\nC. The Court's Plan\n\n1. Population Equality\n\nIn keeping with our overriding concern, the court plan complies withthe \"`as nearly as practicable'\" population equality requirement ofArticle 1, § 2 of the Constitution, Karcher, 462 U.S. at 730, with adeviation of plus or minus one person. In drawing the court plan, thecourt consulted both the existing 1994 plan, originally drawn by thecourt in the Burton litigation and later enacted by the GeneralAssembly, as well as the predecessor Congressional plan from the 1980s.As we did in the House and Senate cases, we generally sought to maintainthe cores of the existing congressional districts, adding or subtractingcompact and contiguous population as individual district requirementsdictated to correct the population deviations.\n\n2. The Voting Rights Act\n\nThe parties agree that the 1994 plan enacted by the General Assembly isthe benchmark plan for purposes of the Voting Rights Act. This existingcongressional plan was substantially drawn by the three-judge court inBurton in 1992, and latercodified with slight modifications by theGeneral Assembly. See S.C. Code Ann. § 7-19-40 (Law. Co-op. Supp.2001). In 1996, the Sixth District was challenged under Shaw/Millerprinciples as an unconstitutional racial gerrymander, see Leonard, et.al. v. Beasley, et. al., 3:96 CV 3640 (D.S.C. filed Dec. 6, 1996), butthe parties settled the matter without resolving the constitutionality ofthe Sixth District. Instead, the state defendants agreed to concede thatracial considerations predominated over traditional districtingprinciples in the draw of the Sixth District should the Leonard plaintiffsbring another such challenge after the 2000 census and redistrictingprocess was completed.\n\nIn this case, no § 2 concerns have been raised by the parties.Indeed, the parties agree that § 2 legally requires maintenance ofthe Sixth District as a majority-minority district and that its corepopulation is the substantial and predominately black population locatedin the Pee Dee and adjoining counties of Richland and Charleston.Furthermore, the creation of the district in 1994 by the GeneralAssembly, and the proposed plans of the current General Assembly andGovernor, are persuasive evidence that the preservation of the districtis now a nonpartisan districting policy of the state.\n\nHowever, the district is presently over 68,000 persons low inpopulation and! therefore, could only maintain its status as a § 2district if there is sufficiently compact majority or near majority-blackpopulation in areas contiguous to the core of the existing district whichshares a community of interest with the existing constituents and in anumber sufficient to make up the existing deficit without losingmajority-minority status overall. We agree that there is and, therefore,that § 2 and § 5 of the Voting Rights Act require the maintenanceof the Sixth District as a majority-minority district, we believe theminority population in the core areas of the Sixth District, as drawn bythe court, is sufficiently compact and shares a sufficiently strongcommunity of interest to warrant being a majority-minority district.\n\nApplication of the 2000 census figures to the 1994 benchmark planproduces the current BVAP of the Sixth District at 57.78%. Apparentlyacknowledging the impossibility of drawing a congressional district thatmaintains this BVAP level, the General Assembly and Governor do notchallenge each other's proposed plans on the basis of § 5 of theVoting Rights Act. As noted previously, both plans contain a BVAP ofbetween 53% and 54%. Rather, only Leatherman raises § 5 as an issuein the Congressional case, asserting that we should strive to achieve thecurrent benchmark BVAP in the Sixth District, and proposing twoalternative draws that achieve a BVAP of 56.57% and 58.87%,respectively.\n\nIn drawing the borders of the Sixth District, we generally followed theexisting lines of the 1994 plan. In doing so, we also remedied thoseaspects of the 1994 plan that appeared to reflect the unnecessarysubordination of traditional districting principles to race. The resultwas our elimination of some of the rougher lines and \"fingers\" thatplague the existing plan and that were apparently the subject of priorchallenge in the Leonard proceeding. Having done so, we found that therewas still a sufficiently numerous, geographically compact, andpolitically cohesive minority population in the area to require thepreservation of a minority district there.\n\nIn drawing the district, however, we discovered that the magnitude ofthe population shortage in the Sixth District revealed by the 2000census, coupled with our correction of some of the questionable aspectsof the existing plan, only allowed for aconstitutionally proper drawthat has a 53.75% BVAP in the district. We are satisfied that we havenarrowly drawn the district and achieved a BVAP that does not result in adilution of the effective voting rights of the district's minorities.Indeed, Congressman James Clyburn testified that a BVAP of 53% or abovewould be sufficient to allow the minority constituency a fair opportunityto elect a non-incumbent black candidate of choice in the district. Insum, the court's draw of the Sixth District does not run afoul of thestandards imposed by § 5 of the Voting Rights Act. Although theoverall voting strength of the minority voters in the Sixth District islowered, the result cannot be avoided without running afoul of thestrictures imposed upon us by the Equal Protection Clause and is not onewhich causes \"a retrogression in the position of racial minorities withrespect to their effective exercise of the electoral franchise.\" Beer,425 U.S. at 141 (emphasis added); see also Abrams, 521 U.S. at 95.\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e29\u003c/span\u003e\n\n3. Other Considerations in the Draw of District Six\n\nWe also considered the areas of dispute among the parties as to theprecise lines of the Sixth District. Although our draw of the SixthDistrict incorporates the same cores of those in the existing plan andthe proposed plans, our ultimate plan varies somewhat from all of theothers.\n\nUnder the current plan, the Second District contains all or portions of11 counties and the Sixth District contains all or portions of 16counties. The House plan places the Second District in all or part of 10counties and places the Sixth District in all or portions of 14counties. The Governor's plan places the Second District in all or partof 9 counties and places the Sixth District in all or portions of 12counties. The court's plan places the Second District in all or part of10 counties and places the Sixth District in all or part of 14 counties.Therefore, the court's plan, like those of the General Assembly and theGovernor, improves upon the current plan in at least this limitedrespect.\n\nThe major differences between the General Assembly and the Governorstem from the proffered splits of Orangeburg, Calhoun, and GeorgetownCounties. The General Assembly proposed to maintain the existing splitsof Orangeburg and Calhoun Counties between the Second and SixthDistricts, eliminate the split of Colleton County and place it whollywithin the Sixth District, and split Georgetown County between the Sixthand First Districts. The Governor, on the other hand, proposed toeliminate the existing splits of Orangeburg and Calhoun Counties andplace those counties wholly within the Sixth District; eliminate theexisting split of Colleton County, but place it wholly within the SecondDistrict; and keep Georgetown County wholly within the First District.\n\nIn the court's plan, Darlington County is removed from the SixthDistrict and placed wholly within the Fifth District. Beaufort County isplaced wholly within the Second District, eliminating that split as well.The split of Colleton County is eliminated by placing Colleton Countywholly within the Sixth District, but a splitis created in GeorgetownCounty between the Sixth District and the First District.\n\nWith regard to Orangeburg County and Calhoun County, the courtconsidered eliminating the existing splits, but elected to maintain thestatus quo in those areas by maintaining the splits (albeit in a slightlycleaner fashion), and to provide needed population to the Sixth Districtinstead from the remainder of Colleton County residents. According to theevidence, the western portions of Orangeburg County and Calhoun Countyare an important part of the existing core of the Second District.Indeed, in the 1980s, and for most of the twentieth century, CalhounCounty and Orangeburg County were located wholly within theMidlands-based Second District. It was the creation of themajority-minority district compelled by § 2, and first drawn by theBurton court in 1992, that removed the eastern portions of those countiesfrom the Second District, adding the predominately black population inthat area to the compact and contiguous majority-black population of thePee Dee to create the Sixth District. As a result, the Second Districtwas forced to partially migrate away from its Midlands base, picking upAllendale, Hampton, Jasper, and Beaufort counties.\n\nThe legislature's draw after Burton also necessitated removal of aportion of Colleton County from its home in the First District (apredominately coastal district) and placement of it within the SecondDistrict. Thus, unlike the western portions of Orangeburg County andCalhoun County, which have always been in the Second District, theColleton County constituents in the Second District are relativenewcomers, placed there as a result of compliance with the Voting RightsAct in the 1990s.\n\nThis court, therefore, was faced with a number of competingconsiderations in this area. Viewing the Sixth District in isolation fromits surrounding districts, we considered adding the needed populationfrom the contiguous majority-black area of Colleton County, as well asthe contiguous majority-black counties of Allendale, Hampton, andJasper, currently in the Second District. But, this decision would haveisolated Beaufort County from the Second District, necessitating itsinclusion in the First District and resultant large changes to the coresof all three districts. Accordingly, we elected to maintain the split ofOrangeburg and Calhoun Counties, which preserved these core areas of theSecond District and caused the fewest changes elsewhere.\n\nOur decisions in these areas did, however, impact Georgetown County.Under the current plan, Georgetown County is located wholly within theFirst District. Under the General Assembly plan, Georgetown County issplit between the First and Sixth districts. The Governor proposed thatGeorgetown County be contained wholly within the Sixth District.\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e30\u003c/span\u003eThe court plan splits Georgetown County (albeit in a different fashionthan that proposed by the General Assembly plan), dividing its residentsbetween the Sixth District and First District.\n\nWeighing all the competing considerations, we believe the county splitsin our plan, however unfortunate they may seem in isolation, best servethe concurrent goals of achieving population equality, preserving thecores of the existing congressional districts, and maintaining the SixthDistrict as a majority-minority districtunder the Voting Rights Act while recognizing state redistrictingprinciples.\n\n4. Fort Jackson and the Savannah River Site\n\nWe also considered, but rejected, Governor Hodges' proposed relocationof Fort Jackson from the Second District to the Sixth District in hisPlan B. Congressman Clyburn testified that he requested the relocation ofFort Jackson from the Second District to the Sixth District upon thedeath in the fall of 2000 of Congressman Floyd Spence, who representedthe Second District. Prior to his death, Congressman Spence served asChairman of the House Armed Services Committee. The Second District isnow represented by Congressman Joe Wilson, who was elected in a specialelection after Congressman Spence's death.\n\nAccording to Congressman Clyburn, who testified at trial, as a seniormember of Congress and a member of the House Appropriations Committee, heis now in a better position than the recently elected Congressman Wilsonto serve the interests of Fort Jackson. Not surprisingly, CongressmanWilson expressed a contrary opinion. He testified that Fort Jacksonshould remain in its historical place in the Second District and that, inany event, he has now been elected a member of the House Armed ServicesCommittee and can serve the Fort's interests as well or better thanCongressman Clyburn.\n\nWe express no opinion on the issue of whether Congressman Clyburn orCongressman Wilson is best suited to serve the interests of FortJackson. We are confident that both men will attempt to serve thisimportant South Carolina interest regardless of its district home.However, even were we to agree that the move had some political benefit,such an important change to the core of an existing district in aredistricting plan, based upon nothing more than our determination thatone elected official will do a better job than another, is clearly beyondthe scope of our remedial authority. The Governor's attorney hasimplicitly conceded the same, admitting that the requested relocation ofFort Jackson has no relevance to the task of remedying themalapportionment of the existing congressional districts in a mannerconsistent with the mandates of the Voting Rights Act. We think thatobvious truth, and admirable concession, ends the matter. For largely thesame reasons, we also rejected the Governor's proposal to move theSavannah River Site entirely from the Third District to the SecondDistrict.\n\nVII. Conclusion\n\nIn drawing the plans to remedy South Carolina's unconstitutionaldistricting plans, we have approached our task with great concern,attempting to apply federal redistricting principles in such a way as topreserve, where possible, the status quo in South Carolina and to minimizethe damage to existing districts where large population changes haveoccurred. We have also attempted to adhere to the requirements that theVoting Rights Act would impose upon the South Carolina legislature in theredistricting context, in order to avoid the imposition of a plan thatmight have the unintended effect of diluting the voting strength of SouthCarolina's minority population or a plan that unnecessarily retrogressesthe fragile gains minority voters have achieved over the past two decadesin this state. Like our predecessors faced with the task in the 1990s, weencourage the General Assembly and the Governor to work together to adoptany plan that could improve upon what we have done. They are, of course,in the best position to do so. We have done our best in the interim.\n\nACCORDINGLY, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the State of South Carolina ishereby enjoined from conducting any further elections under the existingelectoral districts for the South Carolina House of Representatives, theSouth Carolina Senate, and the United States Congress.\n\nIT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the redistricting plans for the SouthCarolina House of Representatives (set forth at Exhibit A), for the SouthCarolina Senate (set forth at Exhibit B), and for the South CarolinaCongressional Delegation (set forth at Exhibit C)\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e31\u003c/span\u003e shall be thelawful election districts for each of those bodies for the electionsscheduled in 2002 and for all subsequent elections until the SouthCarolina General Assembly, with the approval of the Governor and inaccordance with § 5 of the Voting Rights Act, ends its currentimpasse and enacts a redistricting plan for any or all of them.\n\nORDER OF CLARIFICATION\n\nBy order dated March 20, 2002, this three-judge panel issued an orderdeclaring the existing electoral districts for the South CarolinaCongressional Delegation to the United States Congress, the SouthCarolina House of Representatives, and the South Carolina Senateunconstitutionally malapportioned and enjoining the State of SouthCarolina from conducting any further elections under the existingelectoral schemes. Such action, the court held, was necessary because theelected officials of South Carolina had failed to redistrict the state'sGeneral Assembly and its six Congressional Seats and were at an impasseon the issue, and, there was no chance that the governing officials wouldbe able to reach a compromise in time for the regularly-scheduled primaryand general elections scheduled for June 11, 2002, and November 5, 2002,respectively.\n\nOn April 4, 2002, the South Carolina Attorney General advised the courtthat two special elections were currently scheduled to fill two existingvacancies in the South Carolina General Assembly — one in the SouthCarolina House :)f Representatives and one in the South Carolina Senate.While advocating no position on the issue, the Attorney General expressedsome question as to whether the two special elections could proceed underthe existing electoral districts as planned without running afoul of thiscourt's March 20, 2002 redistricting plan and order.\n\nAlthough the State of South Carolina is not technically a party to thislitigation, the court is sensitive to the unusual circumstances of thiscase and to the State's request that we clarify our intentions under theMarch 20th ruling in order to ensure that the upcoming special electionsand any future special elections not be unnecessarily subjected tochallenge under our decision. Accordingly, we agree that a clarificationof our ruling is appropriate.\n\nFirst, although not raised as an issue by any of the parties beforeit, the court specifically asked all parties during the trial whether thespecial election for the South Carolina Senate seat — which had beenvacated by Congressman Joe Wilson and of which the court had become aware— would be impacted by this litigation. The Governor's counselaffirmativelyrepresented that it was not so impacted, and no other parties raised acontrary position.\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e1\u003c/span\u003e\n\nSecond, to the extent our March 20, 2002 order can be read to requirethe pending special elections to be conducted under the 2002court-ordered redistricting plans, or that any other special electionsheld prior to the next round of regularly-scheduled elections beconducted under the 2002 court-ordered redistricting plans, we disavowthat intent. Such an interpretation would be neither prudent norpractical. In every case, the new district lines omit some persons and/oradd others and, in the case of two state House districts, the districtshave been completely collapsed and moved to high-growth areas of thestate, If special elections held prior to the next round ofregularly-scheduled elections were to be held under the new districtlines, the effect would be to leave some persons with no representationand others with double representation.\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e2\u003c/span\u003e Such a situation is obviouslynot one that the United States Constitution would allow, much lessrequire. Cf. Gaona v. Anderson, 989 F.2d 299 (9th Cir. 1993) (per curiam)(rejecting Voting Rights Act challenge to use of old version of statesenate district for an interim special election); Political ActionConference of Illinois v. Daley, 976 F.2d 335 (7th Cir. 1992) (holdingthat city need not alter its redistricting scheme even though four-yearterms of aldermen elected in 1991 resulted in a four-year delay in usingnew 1990 census data); French v. Boner, 963 F.2d 890 (6th Cir. 1992)(holding that city had no constitutional duty to re-conduct electionsheld after the new decennial census data became available in 1991, butbefore a new apportionment plan could be put into effect).\n\nUnder our March 20, 2002 order, the State of South Carolina is onlyenjoined from conducting the regularly-scheduled 2002 primary and generalelections under the existing electoral districts for the United StatesCongress and for the South Carolina House of Representatives, and afterthe November 2002 General Election, from conducting any further electionsunder the existing electoral districts for the United States Congress andthe South Carolina House off Representatives. All suchregularly-scheduled elections, and all special elections held after theNovember 2002 General Election, must be conducted in accordance with theredistricting plans forthe South Carolina Congressional Delegation andSouth Carolina House of Representatives adopted by this court in itsMarch 20, 2002 order, unless and until the South Carolina GeneralAssembly, with the approval of the Governor and in accordance with §5 of the Voting Rights Act, ends its current impasse and enacts analternative redistricting plan for the legislative body at issue.\n\nThe State of South Carolina is likewise enjoined from conducting theregularly-scheduled 2004 primary and general elections under the existingelectoral districts for the South Carolina Senate and, after the November2004 General Election, from conducting any further elections under theexisting electoral districts for the South Carolina Senate. All suchregularly-scheduled elections, and all special elections held after theNovember 2004 General Election, must be conducted in accordance with theredistricting plans for the South Carolina Senate adopted by this courtin its March 20, 2002 order, unless and until the South Carolina GeneralAssembly, with the approval of the Governor and in accordance with §5 of the Voting Rights Act, ends its current impasse and enacts aredistricting plan for the South Carolina Senate.\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003e1.

We believe the ACLU isbarred from raising a contrary position at this late date. However, ourdecision to clarify the order pursuant to our authority under Fed. R.Civ. P. 60(a) should suffice to address their position.\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003e2. For example, under the March 20, 2002, redistricting plan for theSouth Carolina House of Representatives, House District 68, located inthe severely under-populated Pee Dee area, was collapsed and moved to asubstantially over-populated coastal area in Horry County. If the currentrepresentative of House District 68 were to leave office and a specialelection conducted, the new representative would be elected from HorryCounty, leaving Horry County residents in the \"new\" District 68 with tworepresentatives in the House and \"old\" District 69 residents in the PeeDee with none.\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003e1. The redistricting process in South Carolina has historically been atroubled one. Much of that history is discussed in detail in Burton v.Sheheen, 793 F. Supp. 1329, 1337-40 (D.S.C. 1992), vacated sub non.Statewide Reapportionment Advisory Comm. v. Theodore, 508 U.S. 968(1993), in which a three-judge court was called upon to address anear-identical impasse for all three elective bodies following therelease of the 1990 decennial census, and in Smith v. Beasley,946 F. Supp. 1174, 1177-79 (D.S.C. 1996), in which a three-judge courtwas called upon to address the constitutionality of nine House ofRepresentative election districts and three Senate election districtsdrawn by the South Carolina General Assembly after the Burton court planswere vacated by the Supreme Court.\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003e2. The original complaint was brought by the Colleton County Council,Steven Murdaugh, individually and in his official capacity as Chairman ofColleton County Council, Dr. Joseph Flowers, individually and in hisofficial capacity as a member of Colleton County Council, and by fourteenadditional residents of Colleton County. Colleton County, as well asSteven Murdaugh and Dr. Joseph Flowers in their official capacities, weresubsequently dismissed by order of this court.\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003e3.

Because regular elections for the South Carolina Senate seats willnot be held until 2004, we considered sua sponte the propriety ofimplementing a remedial plan for the Senate at this time, due to thepossibility that the impasse could be broken after the Gubernatorial andHouse elections in November 2002. However, we concluded that the matteris ripe. The existing Senate plan was challenged as unconstitutionalunder the one-person, one-vote mandate, the parties agreed that theexisting plan is unconstitutionally malapportioned (and offered noopposition to the entry of summary judgment as to this issue), and theparties stipulated that the Governor and General Assembly are indeed at animpasse. Principles of judicial economy also counseled us to act upon thematter. The parties and the court have expended time and other resourcespreparing to address the matter without objection and, in any event, thecourt-imposed plan is only an interim remedy; the plan is onlyenforceable unless and until the South Carolina General Assembly, withthe approval of the Governor and in accordance with § 5 of the VotingRights Act, ends its current impasse and adopts its own redistrictingplan.\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003e5. The Supreme Court has also held that courts must utilizesingle-member districts \"[u]nless the . . .

The citizens of Colleton County and of Georgetown County haveoffered plans that substantially incorporate the state-wide deficienciesof the other proffered plans, making unique modifications in their areaswhich address their particular localized concerns. On the whole, theseproffered modifications do not appear to be politically motivated, butrather driven by county-based desires. Accordingly, we address theirunique requests in isolation and, where appropriate, incorporate theirrequests into our plans.\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003e9. Because the parties have raised the issue of constructing theirplans by Voting Tabulation Districts (VTDs) and precincts, we note that inmany cases there is a difference between the two. VTDs are geographicalboundaries established by the United States Census Bureau prior tocollecting data for the decennial census. Ideally, the VTDs would supplydata from the census which coincide with precinct boundaries. However,precinct boundaries in many instances do not follow either natural ormanmade features. While VTD boundaries are established prior to thecensus and remain in place for the decade, precincts are units created bythe General Assembly for use in elections and for the collection ofelection data on a county-by-county basis. The latter may be changed atthe will of the legislature and, in fact, there have already been anumber of precinct changes since the creation of the VTD boundaries thatwere used in the 2000 decennial census. The end result, of course, isthat VTDs and precincts are not synonymous in all instances, but anyprecinct splits that exist in the court plans can be remedied in anylegislative session.\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003e10. A majority-minority district is one in which the minoritypopulation comprises greater than 50% of the total population in thedistrict. It is undisputed that the black population in South Carolina isthe only minority present in significant concentrations in any area towarrant protection under the Voting Rights Act. Accordingly, we use theterms \"minority\" and \"black\" interchangeably.\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003e11. In City of Mobile v. Bolden, 446 U.S. 55 (1980), the Supreme Courtheld that a vote dilution claim under § 2 was only actionable it thechallenged practice was adopted or maintained for the purpose ofdiscriminating against minorities.

Although Gingles actually set forth the requirements forestablishing a § 2 challenge to a multi-member districting plan, seeGingles, 478 U.S. at 50-51, the Supreme Court has subsequently held thatthe same three prerequisites are necessary to establish a § 2 claimwith respect to single-member districts.

The three-judge panel in Smith provided a helpful summaryof the factors that have been identified by the Supreme Court asevidencing race-based line drawing:\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003eThey are: using land bridges in a deliberate attempt to bring black population into a district (Miller); use of sophisticated computers with block-by-block racial data (Bush); evidence of demographer's. purpose in drawing the challenged lines (Shaw and Miller) creation of new, non-compact and oddly shaped districts beyond those necessary to avoid retrogression (Miller and Shaw); creation of districts that exhibit disregard for city limits, local election precincts, and voting tabulation districts (Bush); districts that wind \"in snakelike fashion\" until enough black neighborhoods are included to create a black-majority district (Shaw I); establishment of a fixed percentage of minority population with[in] a district . . . to establish a safe black district (Bush); evidence that race or percentage of race could not be compromised (Shaw II) statements by legislators indicating that race was the predominant factor in creating the challenged districts (Miller); and statements made in submission for preclearance to the Department of Justice that its purpose was to comply with the dictates of the Department's rejection letter (Shaw II)\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003eSmith, 946 F.

Justice O'Connor reconciled the competing considerations involvedin the review of equal protection challenges made in the context of aVoting Rights case as follows:\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003eToday's decisions, in conjunction with the recognition of the compelling state interest in compliance with the reasonably perceived requirements of § 2, present a workable framework for the achievement of the[] twin goals [of \"combating the symptoms of racial polarization in politics and eliminating unnecessary race-based state action\"]. I would summarize that framework, and the rules governing the States' consideration of race in the districting process as follows. [S]o long as they do not subordinate traditional districting criteria to the use of race for its own sake or as a proxy. States may intentionally create majority-minority districts and may otherwise take race into consideration, without coming under strict scrutiny. Only if traditional districting criteria are neglected and that neglect is predominately due to the misuse of race does strict scrutiny apply.\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003eBush, 517 U.S. at 993 (O'Connor, J., concurring) (emphasis added;citations omitted). Under Justice O'Connor's view, states may take raceinto consideration and intentionally create majority-minority districtswithout triggering strict scrutiny, so long as the state does not allowthe use of race to predominate over the use of traditional districtingconsiderations. However, \"districts that are bizarrely shaped andnoncompact, and that otherwise neglect traditional districting principles. . . for predominately racial reasons are unconstitutional.\" Id. at994.\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003e16. Districts drawn by a state legislature which deviate fromtraditional districting principles for the purpose of serving partisanpolitics do not trigger the strict scrutiny analysis. See Easley v.Cromartie, 532 U.S. 234, 257 (2001). But as noted previously, this courtmay not draw its plans to serve partisan purposes.\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003e17. In Bush, five members of the Court \"assumed without deciding\" thatcompliance with § 2 of the Voting Rights Act is a compelling stateinterest. 517 U.S. at 977 (plurality opinion); id. at 1003 (concurringopinion of Thomas, J., joined by Scalia, J.). Justice O'Connor, however,who authored the plurality opinion, also wrote a separate concurringopinion in which she expressed her opinion that compliance with the Act isa compelling state interest, see id. at 992 (concurring opinion ofO'Connor, J.), a view that seems to be shared by the four dissentingjustices as well, see id. at 1004 (dissenting opinion of Stevens, J.,joined by Ginsberg and Breyer, JJ.); id. at 1065 (dissenting opinion ofSouter, J., joined by Ginsberg and Breyer, JJ.).\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003e18. Dr. Ruoff examined 401 elections in the period from 1992 to 2000,including 234 black-white elections, 142 white-white elections, 24black-black elections and 1 Hispanic-white election, using correlationanalysis, double-equation ecological regression analysis, and extreme orhomogenous precinct analysis, which are the generally accepted techniquesfor analyzing racial polarization. See, e.g., Gingles, 478 U.S. at52-53.\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003e19. Dr. Loewen testified that, based upon his study of black-whitecontests, 85% of the whites voted white and 84% of the blacks voted black(compared to 90% and 85%, respectively, in the 1970s and 1980s).\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003e20. In analyzing this same data, which remains the most recent, theSmith court noted that \"there is a socio-economic gap between the averagewhite citizen and the average black citizen. There is a larger percentageof blacks than whites below the poverty level; the household income ofblacks is generally less than that of whites; unemployment is greateramong blacks; and the level of formal education among blacks is less. . . .More blacks than whites are without private means of transportation,more whites than blacks own their own homes. Infant mortality is greateramong blacks.\" Smith, 946 F. Supp. at 1203.\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003e21. The 2000 census data, unlike that of prior decades, reports theblack population in several racial categories, including \"black only,\"which would report the least numerous count, \"all or any part black\"(AP-Blk), which would report the most numerous count, and \"non-Hispanicblack,\" which would fall somewhere between the two. The parties differedin their choice of category for purposes of analyzing the blackpopulation in this case; however, the use of the differing blackpopulation categories has an insignificant impact on the analysis beforethis court. Like the House and the Governor, we use the \"black only\"category in our order.\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003e22. Because of the high level of racial polarization in the votingprocess in South Carolina, \"influence districts\" allow the DemocraticParty the opportunity to gain control of the General Assembly. It is,therefore, an inherently politically based policy. With the aid of asubstantial (but not majority) black population that votes nearlyexclusively for a Democratic candidate, a white Democrat can usuallydefeat a black Democrat in the primary election and then use the blackvote to defeat any Republican challenger in the general election. SeeSmith, 946 F. Supp. at 1183. Although the Governor asserts that a drawbased on \"traditional districting principles\" will naturally lead to thecreation of such districts, he does not advance a claim that this courtcan or should consider race to intentionally draw such \"influencedistricts.\"\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003e23. An individual district's deviation is the difference in totalpopulation from the ideal district size. A plan's total populationdeviation is derived by adding the largest positive deviation in the planand the largest negative deviation in the plan.\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003e24. As previously noted, the Governor specifically denied that he wasclaiming a right to influence districts under § 2 of the VotingRights Act, but rather argued that the House plan could not be adopted byus because it was the product of \"white gerrymandering\" in violation ofthe Equal Protection Clause.\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003e25. The ACLU admitted that their plans did not consider any communityof interest factors or any political factors other than incumbencyprotection.\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003e26. Other areas of substantial growth included Lexington County, whichgrew 28.9%, and York County, which grew 25.2%. Conversely, many areas inthe Pee Dee and Low Country lost population: Allendale County lost 4.4%,Bamberg County lost 1.4%, Marlboro County lost 3.0%. and Union Countylost 1.5%.\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003e27. As noted previously, there is no real dispute that the remainingGingles prerequisites — racially polarized and white bloc voting— exist statewide.\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003e28. As noted in more detail infra, District 7 is a majority-minoritydistrict in terms of total black population only. Thus, the benchmarkplan contains ten majority-minority districts, if defined as districtswith a total black population that exceeds the 50% mark, but only ninemajority-minority districts that exceed the 50% mark in terms of BVAP.Unless otherwise noted, our reference to majority-minority districtshereafter refers to those districts that contain a BVAP greater than50%. An opportunity district, in contrast, is one in which it isdemonstrated (usually by election data and expert testimony interpretingit) that the BVAP percentage in a district is sufficient to actuallyafford the minority population an equal opportunity to elect thecandidate of its choice.\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003e29. We note that the court attempted several alternative draws of theSixth District that would maintain it as a Pee Dee and Low Countrydistrict and eliminate the splits of either Richland County or CharlestonCounty, or both. . . . However, we found that it was not possible tocreate a majority-minority district that achieved a greater than 53% BVAPwithout splitting nearly every adjoining county along racial lines andcausing major changes in every other congressional district in thestate.\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003e30.
