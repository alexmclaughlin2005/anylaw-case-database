    "body": "CORRECTED OPINION\n\nPer Curiam.\n\nPursuant to rule 2.130(e) of the Florida Rules of Judicial Administration, the Worker's Compensation Rules Committee filed a petition with this Court submitting proposed amendments to the Florida Rules of Workers' Compensation Procedure.\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e1\u003c/span\u003e{/Cite} Rule 2.130(e) permits the committee, with the approval of the board of governors of The Florida Bar, to submit proposals of an emergency nature to this Court. The committee and the board of governors both concluded that the proposed changes were needed immediately in light of the 1989 and 1990 legislative changes to the Workers' Compensation Act.\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e2\u003c/span\u003e{/Cite} We agreed and accepted jurisdiction to consider the proposed amendments.\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e3\u003c/span\u003e{/Cite}\n\nThe following is a brief summary of the material changes as set forth in the proposed amendments:\n\n(1) The workers' compensation trial rules (part A) have been amended to reflect the legislature's redesignation of the title deputy commissioner to judge of compensation claims and to allow for the use of facsimile machines to effectuate service;\n\n(2) The workers' compensation appellate rules (part B) were rewritten to clarify the language of the rules and to reorganize the contents of the rules to conform more closely with the format used in the Florida Rules of Appellate Procedure and a new procedure was created regarding the discretionary review of nonfinal orders;\n\n(3) A new part (part C) was proposed to provide a set of rules to implement 1989 and 1990 legislation authorizing mediation as an alternative resolution process for workers' compensation disputes;\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e4\u003c/span\u003e{/Cite} and\n\n(4) A substantial number of the forms set forth in the rules (part D) were amended in response to either new legislation or criticism from practitioners, and the notice of appeal form was revised to set forth the specific benefits that are the subject matter of an appeal.\n\nA draft of the rule changes was unanimously approved by the board of governors of The Florida Bar, and no comments on the proposed amendments were received in response to their publication in the Florida Bar News on December 1, 1991. After a review of the committee's proposals, we adopt the amendments to the Florida Rules of Workers' Compensation Procedure as they are set out following this opinion. The amended rules are effective immediately upon the filing of this opinion.\n\nIt is so ordered.\n\nSHAW, C.J. and OVERTON, McDONALD, BARKETT, GRIMES, KOGAN and HARDING, JJ., concur.\n\nTHE FILING OF A MOTION FOR REHEARING SHALL NOT ALTER THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF THESE RULES.\n\nFLORIDA RULES OF WORKERS' COMPENSATION PROCEDURE\n\nPART A.

The rules are amended throughout to reflect the change in the title \"deputy commissioner\" to \"judge of compensation claims.\"\n\nRULE 4.020.

This replaces rule 2, 1977 W.C.R.P.\n\n1988 Amendment : . This rule is revised to include definitions of \"carrier\" (to include self-insureds and servicing agents) and \"claimant\" (to include any party with standing to bring a claim under C c hapter 440, Florida Statutes).\n\nRULE 4.022. FORMS OF PLEADING\n\nPleadings in proceedings before the Deputy Commissioner judge of compensation claims under these rules shall substantially conform to these rules unless otherwise ordered by the Deputy Commissioner judge of compensation claims.

All pleadings shall contain the mailing address and telephone number of the party or attorney filing the pleading. Pleadings shall be typewritten or printed on 8 1/2\" by 11\" bond paper. Proposed orders, except as otherwise provided in these rules, shall be accompanied by an original and one copy for the use of the Deputy Commissioner judge of compensation claims together with enough copies and pre-addressed envelopes to permit service on all parties and counsel of record.\n\nCommittee Notes\n\n1988 Adoption : . This rule is intended to standardize the form of pleadings and the preparation of documents by counsel for the use of the D d eputy C c ommissioner.\n\nRULE 4.030. FILING AND SERVICE\n\n(a) Filing. Unless otherwise ordered or otherwise provided by these rules or C c hapter 440, Florida Statutes, any pleading or other papers filed in the proceedings shall be served on each party.\n\n(b) Method and Proof of Service.\n\n(1) Same; How Made.

When service is effectuated by mail, five 5 days shall be added to the time allowed for the performance of any act required to be done, or allowed to be done, within a certain time after service. (This subsection subdivision does not apply to the filing requirements for institution of appellate proceedings or notices of hearing.) .\n\n(d) Subpoenas. Issuance, service, and proof of service of subpoenas of the Deputy Commissioner judge of compensation claims shall be in the form and manner provided by the Florida Statutes and the Florida Rules of Civil Procedure.\n\nCommittee Notes\n\n1979 Adoption : . This replaces R r ule 2(h), 1977 W.C.R.P., which merely provided \"'Service' shall be as provided in the Florida Rules of Civil Procedure.\"\n\nSub section division (c) replaces R rule 3(b), W.C.R.P. 1977. The caveat to the filing of appellate proceedings is to warn of the jurisdictional nature of § section 440.25(4)(f), Florida . Stat . utes ( 1979), which provides:\n\nBeginning on October 1, 1979, procedures with respect to appeals from orders of deputy commissioners shall be governed by rules adopted by the Supreme Court. Such an order shall become final 30 days after mailing of copies of such order to the parties, unless appealed pursuant to such rules. The provisions of paragraphs (a)-(e) shall apply only until September 30, 1979.\n\n1984 Revision: Amendment. Clarifies R r ules 3(c) and 8(a) by specifically excluding fifteen ( 15 ) - day hearing notice from operation of R r ule 3(c).\n\n1988 Amendment : . This rule is not intended to confer standing to sue on any person not accorded such standing by Florida Statutes.\n\nRULE 4.040. COMPUTATION OF TIME\n\nIn computing any period of time prescribed or allowed by these rules, by order, or by applicable statute, the day of the act or event from which the designated period of time begins to run shall not be included. The last day of the period so computed shall be included. If any act required to be done, or allowed to be done, falls up on a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday, performance of said that act shall be required up on the next regular working day.\n\nCommittee Notes\n\n1979 Adoption : . This replaces R r ule 3(a), 1977 W.C.R.P.\n\nRULE 4.050. CLAIMS\n\nClaims and notices to controvert shall be filed with the D d ivision at its office in the City of Tallahassee. Claims shall be subject to adjudication or dismissal only by order of the Deputy Commissioner judge of compensation claims or reviewing court.\n\nCommittee Notes\n\n1979 Adoption : . This replaces R r ule 4, 1977 W.C.R.P.\n\nIt appears to be the view of the Division of Workers' Compensation (hereafter \"Division\") that the filing of a claim . . . , the form of that claim . . . , and all massaging of that claim prior to the same being assigned to a deputy commissioner [for judicial function] pursuant to an application for hearing, is solely and totally within the purview of the division and ought not be addressed by these Workers' Compensation Rules of Procedure, or any other rules except those of the division. § Section 440.19(2)(d), Florida . ... Stat . utes , (1979) , provides that:\n\nSuch claim shall be filed with the division at its office in Tallahassee and shall contain the name and address of the employee, the name and address of the employer, and a statement of the time, place, nature, and cause of the injury, of such fairly equivalent information as will put the division and the employer on notice with respect to the identity of the parties and the specific compensation benefit which is due but has not been paid or is not being provided. Any claim, or portion thereof, not in compliance with this subsection shall be subject to dismissal upon motion of any interested party, the division, or the deputy commissioners.\n\nCf. § 440.25(1) Fla.Stat. (1979); § 440.20(10)(b), Fla.Stat. (1979).\n\nThis differs -- radically -- from the traditional source of creating and disciplining the pleading by which civil actions are initiated.\n\n1984 Revision: Amendment. Derived from section 440.271, Florida Statutes, and R r ule 20, Florida Workers' Compensation Rules of Procedure. Providing for exclusive adjudicatory powers in workers' compensation matters with the D d eputy C c ommissioner or reviewing court rather than the Division of Workers' Compensation.\n\nRULE 4.051. CONSOLIDATION OF CLAIMS\n\nThe Deputy Commissioner Judges of compensation claims may, on his their own motion or on the motion of any party, consolidate claims for the purpose of hearings or for any other purpose.\n\nCommittee Notes\n\n1988 Adoption : . This rule formalizes existing procedure for consolidation of claims.\n\nRULE 4.056. RIPENESS\n\nAt any time during any proceeding, on the motion of any party or on the Deputy Commissioner's judge's own motion, the Deputy Commissioner judge of compensation claims may make a determination of the ripeness for adjudication of any pending claim or defense or element thereof. The Deputy Commissioner judge of compensation claims may, in his their discretion, take such testimony, hear such argument, and enter such orders as may be necessary to determine the ripeness of an issue. The Deputy Commissioner may, in order t T o protect the interests of any party and to advance the proceedings, the judge of compensation claims may\n\n(a) sever any issue , or ;\n\n(b) continue a scheduled hearing as to any or all issues , or ;\n\n(c) reserve jurisdiction of any issue , ; or\n\n(d) dismiss any issue without prejudice.\n\nIn determining the ripeness of any issue, the Deputy Commissioner judge of compensation claims shall consider whether the opposing party has had adequate time within which to prepare to litigate the issue, taking into account the due diligence of the parties.\n\nCommittee Notes\n\n1988 Adoption : . This rule recognizes the serial nature of claims and defenses as they arise under C c hapter 440, Florida Statutes. It codifies existing procedure to permit the D d eputy C c ommissioner to adjudicate issues as they become ripe.\n\nRULE 4.058. PETITION FOR MODIFICATION; CLAIM PETITION FOR REIMBURSEMENT FROM SPECIAL DISABILITY TRUST FUND\n\nPetitions for modification pursuant to S s ection 440.28, Florida Statutes, and petitions for reimbursement from the Special Disability Trust Fund pursuant to S s ection 440.49(2), Florida Statutes, shall be made substantially in the form of a claim. Adjudication of a petition under this rule shall be in the manner provided in these rules for the disposition of claims and defenses.\n\nRULE 4.060. REPRESENTATION AND APPEARANCE OF COUNSEL; SUBSTITUTION OF COUNSEL; WITHDRAWAL OF COUNSEL\n\n(a) Appearance of Counsel. An attorney undertaking the representation of a party to a proceeding under these rules shall promptly file with the division a notice of appearance, not to exceed one page in length, with the Division prior to the filing of an application for hearing, or with the office of the Deputy Commissioner judge of compensation claims having jurisdiction of the industrial accident after the filing of an application for hearing. The notice shall bear the style and caption provided in F f orm 4.901 and include the address and telephone number of counsel. A claim or application for hearing signed by counsel and containing the address and telephone number of counsel shall suffice as a notice of appearance. Notice of appearance shall be filed by any successor, or associated attorney, prior to or concurrently with the filing of any pleading or presentation of oral argument to or before a Deputy Commissioner judge of compensation claims or the district court.\n\n(b) Substitution of Counsel. Substitution of counsel may be effected by the filing and service of a stipulation, for which no approval of the Deputy Commissioner judge of compensation claims is required, or by motion.\n\n(c) Withdrawal of Counsel. An attorney who has filed a claim or has otherwise become an attorney of record for any party to a workers' compensation cause shall remain attorney of record in said cause and shall not be permitted to withdraw from the cause unless he the attorney shall first files with the Deputy Commissioner judge of compensation claims a written motion for withdrawal setting forth the reasons therefor, serving a copy of said motion up on the movant's client and counsel for the adverse party, and shall then shall obtain from the Deputy Commissioner judge of compensation claims an order granting such motion for withdrawal. If appellate proceedings have been instituted in the cause, the motion shall be filed with the appropriate court. Upon the filing of a motion to withdraw as counsel, the Deputy Commissioner judge of compensation claims having jurisdiction of the industrial accident may conduct such hearings as may be requested by any party or on his the judge's own motion to protect the rights of all parties; or the Deputy Commissioner judge of compensation claims may enter an order substantially in the form provided in F f orm 4.907.\n\nCommittee Notes\n\n1979 Adoption : . This replaces R r ule 6, 1977 W.C.R.P.\n\n1988 Amendment : . This rule clarifies existing procedure as to the appearance and substitution of counsel and provides for an alternate procedure to approve the withdrawal of counsel without a hearing in the absence of a timely objection.\n\nRULE 4.061. CONTRACTS OF REPRESENTATION; ATTORNEY FEES\n\n(a) Contracts of Representation. The employee (or claimant) and the attorney for the employee (or claimant) may jointly apply to the Deputy Commissioner judge of compensation claims having jurisdiction of the industrial accident to approve their contract of representation and enforce the provisions thereof. The Deputy Commissioner judge of compensation claims may approve the contract of representation without a formal hearing if it appears to be in substantial compliance with these rules and the provisions of C c hapter 440, Florida Statutes. Upon approval of the contract of representation without a hearing, the Deputy Commissioner judge of compensation claims shall enter an order and serve a copy of the order on the attorney for the employee. The attorney for the employee shall promptly serve a copy of the Deputy Commissioner's order on all parties and counsel of record using the certificate of service provided in F f orm 4.902. Any party, for good cause shown, may object to and move to modify or vacate any order approving a contract of representation at any time. The Deputy Commissioner judge of compensation claims shall promptly hear any such motion. The filing and service of a motion to modify or vacate an order approving a contract of representation shall suspend the operation and effect of the order until the motion is heard and decided. Nothing in this rule shall preclude the Deputy Commissioner judge of compensation claims from modifying or disapproving any contract of representation for good cause or to avoid undue hardship on any party.\n\n(b) Payment of Undisputed Attorney Fees. The employee and the attorney for the employee may jointly move for the Deputy Commissioner judge of compensation claims to approve the payment of an attorney fee and reimbursement of costs pursuant to a contract of representation by a stipulated motion substantially in the form provided by these rules. The employee and the employer and its carrier (or servicing agent) and/or their counsel may stipulate to the payment of an attorney fee and costs and submit their stipulation to the Deputy Commissioner judge of compensation claims for approval.\n\n(c) Disputed Attorney Fees or Costs. A claim for attorney fees or costs brought by an attorney or party shall be in the form provided for a claim for compensation and shall be treated as a claim for compensation for all purposes. Any claim for attorney fees shall allege ultimate facts which, if proven, would give rise to entitlement to the award of an attorney fee. Prior to hearing any issue as to the amount of disputed attorney fees or costs, the attorney shall file a verified petition setting forth with specificity the amount of time expended, costs advanced or incurred, and the benefits obtained together with all other allegations of fact pursuant to S s ection 440.34, Florida Statutes. At the request of any party, or on the Deputy Commissioner's judge's own motion, the Deputy Commissioner judge of compensation claims shall determine the procedure for the hearing and adjudication of any issues as to a disputed attorney fee and taxation of costs.\n\nCommittee Notes\n\n1988 Adoption : . This rule formalizes and makes substantially uniform existing practice as to attorney-client contracts and attorney fees as these proceedings have evolved since the 1979 legislative reforms. Approval of any attorney-client agreement by the D d eputy C c ommissioner is discretionary and not mandatory.\n\nRULE 4.062. PAYMENT OF ATTORNEY FEES BY EMPLOYEE\n\nThe Deputy Commissioner judge of compensation claims shall hear any motion for attorney fees in the manner provided for a hearing on a claim for compensation. With respect to proceedings in which the fee is to be paid by the employee, the employee may waive a formal hearing before the Deputy Commissioner judge of compensation claims and the Deputy Commissioner judge of compensation claims may consider the motion ex parte, based up on verified pleadings. No motion for attorney fees shall be granted by the deputy commissioner judge of compensation claims unless it appears affirmatively that the provisions of these rules and of C c hapter 440, Florida Statutes, have been substantially complied with and that the employee has been advised as to those provisions.\n\nCommittee Notes\n\n1988 Adoption : . It is intended that all motions under this rule be sworn to by the employee and contain a notarial jurat.\n\nRULE 4.070. APPLICATION FOR HEARING\n\nAn application for hearing concerning a claim, made pursuant to C c hapter 440, Florida Statutes, shall state concisely in separate numbered paragraphs the reasons for requesting hearing, and the questions at issue or in dispute which the applicant expects the Deputy judge to hear and determine, with sufficient particularity that the responding or opposing parties may be notified of the purpose of the hearing, including the issues to be heard and determined and specific benefit due and not paid. Application for the first hearing or trial in a cause shall be filed with the D d ivision at Tallahassee. Upo O n receipt of an application for hearing, all materials filed with or received by the D d ivision shall be incorporated in the file for forwarding to the appropriate Deputy Commissioner judge of compensation claims who will conduct the hearing. All subsequent materials received or filed also shall be immediately forwarded to the Deputy Commissioner judge of compensation claims. Applications for any subsequent hearings in that cause shall be filed with the Deputy judge to whom the case has been assigned. A copy of the application shall be served on counsel for each party and a copy up on any party not represented by counsel. Failure to serve a copy of the application as required shall be grounds for a continuance or cancellation of the hearing.\n\nCommittee Notes\n\n1979 Adoption : . This replaces R r ule 7, 1977 W.C.R.P. It is derived substantially from § section 440.25(3)(a), Florid a . Stat . utes ( 1979), which again emphasizes \"the specific benefit due and not paid.\" This clearly points up one of the many differences between civil proceedings generally, and workers' compensation . . . : [that] from the 'Notice of Injury' a file is begun and maintained by the division in Tallahassee. As a deputy commissioner assumes supervision for the purpose of providing judicial-type services, that administrative file [in the division] provides, in part, the foundation for the file pertinent to the litigation. Even as the litigation proceeds, the administrative functions must be continued, hence a continuing relationship between the dual nature [of that file as ] . . . administrative/judicial.\n\n1980 Amendment : . This change would keep the D d ivision, the agency which is involved in various stages of the management of workers' compensation cases, apprised of the status of the case, and informed of the reason for the D d eputy's continued possession of the file.\n\n1984 Revision: Amendment. Implements section 440.25(3)(a), Florida Statutes.\n\nRULE 4.080. NOTICE OF HEARING; ORDER OF DEPUTY COMMISSIONER JUDGE OF COMPENSATION CLAIMS\n\n(a) Notice of Hearing. The Deputy Commissioner judge of compensation claims shall hold a hearing within 90 days after the filing of an application for hearing, and shall serve the parties and counsel of record at their last known addresses, with at least 15 days' notice by regular mail. The notice shall state with particularity the questions at issue or in dispute that the judge will hear and determine. Service of a notice of hearing shall be complete upon mailing. Unless otherwise specified in the notice of hearing, the Deputy Commissioner judge may consider and determine all issues pending as of the date of the hearing.\n\n(b) Setting of Hearing. The Deputy Commissioner Judges of compensation claims, may, in his their discretion, may set hearings singly at a time certain, or may set hearings in the aggregate using dockets in the form provided in Rule forms 4.908 and 4.909.\n\n(c) Order. The order of the Deputy Commissioner judge of compensation claims shall set forth findings of fact, conclusions of law, and the Deputy Commissioner's judge's determination of the claim or other ruling. The order shall be signed by the Deputy Commissioner judge of compensation claims and shall include a certificate of service to all parties and counsel of record.\n\nCommittee Notes\n\n1979 Adoption : . This replaces R r ule 8, 1977 W.C.R.P.\n\nIt, too, is derived substantially from § section 440.25(3)(a), Florid a . Stat ., utes ( 1979) Note that the deputy shall give the notice.\n\n1980 Amendment : . 8. (a) Suggestions have been made to remove the requirement that notice to the parties of a hearing be sent by certified mail. The Rules Committee of the Workers' Compensation section is of the opinion that the requirement that the hearing notice be sent by certified mail should be retained for two reasons. In the first instance, the S s tatute, § section 440.25(3)(a), Florid a . Stat . utes, requires notice by certified mail, and, secondly, this provision is viewed as one which provides at least a minimum level of procedural due process.\n\n8. (b) The portion of this rule which the rules committee of the section recommends be removed was in conflict with the wording of R r ule 14, which has been transplanted, in toto, to R r ule 8(b).\n\n1984 Revision: Amendment. Conforms hearing notice requirements to section 440.25(3)(a), Florida Statutes, as amended to delete requirement of certified mail service, and provides clarification of time periods involved to the effect that minimum fifteen ( 15 ) days' notice is measured from the date notice is mailed.\n\n1988 Amendments : . This rule and accompanying forms provide a standard form for the notice of hearing. In the alternative, a hearing docket system is provided for in recognition of the adoption of that procedure in some districts. The provisions of paragraph subdivision (b) are new. The balance of the rule reflects the 1984 revision with minor changes in wording for clarity.\n\nRULE 4.090. DISCOVERY\n\n(a) Depositions. Depositions of witnesses or parties, residing within or without the S s tate, may be taken and may be used in connection with proceedings under C c hapter 440, Florida Statutes, either up on the order of the Deputy Commissioner judge of compensation claims or at the instance of any party or prospective party to such proceeding. For good cause shown, the Deputy Commissioner judge of compensation claims may require the taking of a deposition by telephone.\n\n(b) Production of Documents and Entry on Land. The parties shall be subject to discovery procedures dealing with the production of records and other tangible things, and entry up on land or other property for inspection or other purposes within the scope of discovery, including but not limited to all hospital and medical reports pertaining to the industrial accident, all rehabilitation reports, all records pertaining to the claimant's average weekly wage at the time of the industrial accident or earnings made subsequent to the industrial accident, and a transcript of any recorded statement of a party. The parties shall have 30 days to serve a written response after service of any request under this rule. The Deputy Commissioner judge of compensation claims, for good cause shown, may enlarge or shorten the time allowed for compliance with this rule.\n\n(c) Production of Documents from Non-Parties. The parties may also may seek the production of documents and other tangible things, within the scope of discovery, for inspection and copying from a person who is not a party pursuant to applicable Florida Rules of Civil Procedure.\n\n(d) Jurisdiction. The Deputy Commissioner judge of compensation claims shall have jurisdiction to take appropriate action to compel discovery, including the imposition of sanctions, and, may, as circumstances warrant, may enlarge or shorten the applicable time for complying with discovery.\n\n(e) When Discovery May b B e Had. Discovery under this rule may be had prior to the institution of a claim, if the claimant is represented by an attorney, or after the filing of a claim, in the same manner and for the same purposes as provided in the Florida Rules of Civil Procedure.\n\n(f) Other Discovery. Interrogatories, requests for admission, and other forms of discovery not authorized by this rule shall not be used or permitted in workers' compensation proceedings.\n\n(g) Surveillance. The evidence of any investigator, adjustor, or other witness in the nature of surveillance shall be subject to discovery when such evidence will be used at trial, provided the party intending to use such evidence is first given a reasonable opportunity to depose the party or witness who is the subject of the surveillance.\n\nCommittee Notes\n\n1979 Adoption : . This replaces R r ule 9, 1977 W.C.R.P.\n\nIt is derived substantially from § section 440.30, Florid a . Stat ., utes ( 1979).\n\n1984 Revision: Amendment. Sub sections divisions (b) through (f) are new and formalize additional forms of discovery already widely used in workers' compensation proceedings. This rule specifically declines to adopt interrogatories or requests for admission as unduly cumbersome and contrary to the overriding policy consideration for the expeditious resolution of an injured worker's rights. Although discovery is generally intended to be self-administrating, it is subject to the supervision of the D d eputy C c ommissioner. Stephens v. Southern Furniture Transports, Inc., 420 So.2d 904 (Fla. 1st DCA 1982). This rule does not modify and is consistent with the powers and authority conferred upon the D d eputy C c ommissioner pursuant to section 440.33, Florida Statutes.\n\n1988 Amendment : . Sub section division (g) of this rule is intended to conform to Dodson v. Persell, 390 So.2d 704 (Fla. 1980).\n\nRULE 4.100 . PRETRIAL PROCEDURE\n\n(a) Generally.

The parties shall consider and determine a limitation on the number of expert witnesses . ;\n\n(7) E e stimate trial time . ; and\n\n(8) C c onsider and determine such other matters as may aid in the disposition of the cause.\n\n(b) Notice. The Deputy Commissioner judge of compensation claims shall give the parties at least 15 days' notice of the pretrial conference. If a party or his the party's attorney fails to attend the conference without good cause, the Deputy Commissioner judge of compensation claims may dismiss the claim or strike the defenses, or take such other action as may be authorized by law or these rules. The Deputy Commissioner judge of compensation claims may cancel the pretrial conference up on submission of a written pretrial stipulation. The Deputy Commissioner judge of compensation claims may conduct the pretrial conference by telephone at the request of any party, or on his the judge's own motion, provided all parties are represented by counsel.\n\n(c) Record. The Deputy Commissioner judge of compensation claims shall record the pretrial conference by stenographic or electronic means at the request of any party, or by a written stipulation signed by the parties.\n\n(d) Pretrial Order. At the request of any party, the Deputy Commissioner judge of compensation claims shall promptly enter an order reciting the action taken at the pretrial conference, the amendments allowed to the claims and defenses, and the agreements made by the parties about any of the matters considered, and limiting the issues for trial to those not disposed of by admissions or stipulations of the parties. The Deputy Commissioner judge of compensation claims shall serve the order up on the attorneys for the parties and up on any party not represented by counsel. The order shall control the subsequent course of the action unless the Deputy Commissioner judge of compensation claims modifies it to prevent injustice. The order on the pretrial conference may be in letter form unless a formal order is requested by any party.\n\nCommittee Notes\n\n1979 Adoption ./ . This replaces R r ule 10, 1977 W.C.R.P., but is substantially the same.\n\n1984 Revision: Amendment. Provides that a party has the right to a pretrial conference upon request. Deletes requirement of notice of pretrial by order.\n\nRULE 4.110. PROSECUTION OF CLAIM BEFORE DEPUTY COMMISSIONER JUDGE OF COMPENSATION CLAIMS\n\n(a) Prosecution of Claim. When a trial has been set by a Deputy Commissioner judge of compensation claims, all parties shall diligently prosecute and defend the claim. The Deputy Commissioner Judges of compensation claims may cancel or continue a trial on his their own motion or on the motion of a party if he they find s that the cancellation or continuance is for good cause which has not resulted from lack of diligence in the prosecution or defense of the claim. A notice of voluntary dismissal is without prejudice, except that a second notice of voluntary dismissal by the C c laimant operates as an adjudication of denial of any claim for the same benefit or benefits previously the subject of a voluntary dismissal.\n\n(b) Dismissal of Claim or Petition. Any claim, or any petition to modify, in which it affirmatively appears that no action has been taken by request for hearing, filing of pleadings, order of Deputy Commissioner judge of compensation claims, payment of compensation, provision of medical care, or otherwise for a period of one year, is subject to dismissal for lack of prosecution. Upo O n motion to dismiss filed by any interested party, or up on request of the Deputy Commissioner judge of compensation claims before whom the action is pending, the file shall be forwarded to the appropriate Deputy Commissioner judge of compensation claims who shall dismiss the claim or petition, after service of notice to the parties by regular mail , at their last known addresses , and opportunity for hearing, dismiss the claim or petition, unless a party shows good cause why the claim or petition should remain pending.\n\nCommittee Notes\n\n1979 Adoption : . This replaces R r ule 11, 1977 W.C.R.P.\n\nThe 1977 rule was the result of extensive debate and revision, and the committee did not see need for substantial revision.\n\n1980 Amendment - . Deletion of the words \"after filing\" in R r ule 11(b) allows the dismissal of a state claim after any two year period of inactivity. The change will make this rule consistent with R r ule 1.420(e) of the Florida Rules of Civil Procedure.\n\n1984 Revision: Amendment.\n\n(a) Conforms workers' compensation procedure with Florida Rule of Civil Procedure 1.420(a)(1). Voluntary dismissal of the same claim or claim for the same benefits is with prejudice and operates as a denial of the claim for those benefits.\n\n(b) Conforms nonprosecution time period to civil practice period of one year.\n\nRULE 4.111. PROCEEDINGS BY TELEPHONE\n\nThe Deputy Commissioner judge of compensation claims may conduct any proceeding permitted under these rules or under C c hapter 440, Florida Statutes, by telephone conference provided no live testimony, other than that of an expert witness as defined by the applicable statutes, be is taken without the agreement of all parties and provided a means of recording the proceedings is available if requested by any party.\n\nCommittee Notes\n\n1988 Adoption : . This rule is adapted from R r ule 2.071, Florida Rules of Judicial Administration, to which reference may be made for purposes of construction.\n\nRULE 4.112. EMERGENCY CONFERENCES\n\nThe Deputy Commissioner judge of compensation claims may require the appearance of the parties and counsel before him on less than 15 days' written notice as otherwise required by these rules and by C c hapter 440, Florida Statutes, only to consider the reasonableness and medical necessity of proposed medical treatment where when there is a bona fide emergency involving the health or safety of an employee. The parties may agree to consider other issues at an emergency conference. An emergency conference under this rule shall be advisory in nature, shall not constitute a hearing for any purpose, and shall not result in the entry of an order or the rendering of an adjudication by the Deputy Commissioner judge of compensation claims. No other emergency conference or hearing is permitted by these rules.\n\nCommittee Notes\n\n1988 Adoption : . This rule is intended to allow for a compulsory, advisory conference with the deputy commissioner only as to issues relating to the reasonableness and medical necessity of proposed emergency medical treatment.\n\nRULE 4.113. EFFECT OF CONTINUANCES\n\nAn agreement by the parties to post-trial proceedings, including the post-trial presentation or submission of evidence, or to a continuance of the trial or the pretrial conference shall constitute a waiver by the parties of the requirements of S s ection 440.24(3)(a), and Section 440.24(3)(b) 440.25, Florida Statutes, as to the timeliness of hearings and the entry of orders.\n\nRULE 4.120. ADMISSIBILITY OF EVIDENCE; PROFFERS; EXHIBITS\n\n(a) Admissibility. Whenever a question of the admissibility of evidence is presented for consideration of the Deputy Commissioner judge of compensation claims, he the judge shall promptly rule on it. If an objection is made and not ruled up on by the Deputy Commissioner judge of compensation claims, the ruling shall be presumed to be adverse to the party making the objection.\n\n(b) Proffers. Evidence which has been offered but ruled inadmissible may be proffered but shall be clearly identified as such by the Deputy Commissioner judge of compensation claims.\n\n(c) Exhibits. Voluminous or cumbersome exhibits shall not be received in evidence unless their use is unavoidable. The contents of the D d ivision file with respect to a claim shall not be admissible evidence as such, absent the stipulation of all parties, but individual portions of the file may be admitted if admissible under the rules of evidence. Legible copies may be substituted for original documents when reasonably necessary.\n\nCommittee Notes\n\n1979 Adoption : . This replaces R r ule 12, 1977 W.C.R.P.\n\nRULE 4.130. AGREEMENTS\n\nNo agreement or stipulation shall be valid unless: (1) in writing and signed by the parties or their attorneys, or (2) dictated on the record. Any agreement or stipulation under this rule may be expressly relied on by the Deputy Commissioner judge of compensation claims in any proceeding, unless a party seeks to be relieved of the agreement or stipulation for good cause shown. The Deputy Commissioner judge of compensation claims may abrogate any stipulation which appears to be manifestly contrary to the evidence up on due notice to the parties; however, the Deputy Commissioner judge of compensation claims need not inquire beyond the stipulation or agreement.\n\nCommittee Notes\n\n1979 Adoption : . This replaces R r ule 1 \u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e2\u003c/span\u003e 3, 1977 W.C.R.P.\n\nRULE 4.131. SETTLEMENT OF PROSPECTIVE BENEFITS\n\nIn any proceeding in which the parties undertake to compromise or release the prospective entitlement of the employee to any class of benefits pursuant to S s ection 440.20(12), Florida Statutes:\n\n(a) The parties shall submit their agreement in writing executed by all attorneys of record and by the employee.\n\n(b) The employee shall acknowledge the agreement and its material provisions under oath in writing or before the Deputy Commissioner judge of compensation claims.\n\n(c) An agreement under this rule shall set forth the terms, conditions, and consideration for the settlement together with all material facts necessary for approval of the settlement pursuant to S s ection 440.20(12), Florida Statutes.\n\n(d) Prior to the approval of any agreement under this rule, the parties and their attorneys shall submit to the Deputy Commissioner judge of compensation claims for inclusion in the D d ivision file all evidence in their possession which is material to the consideration and disposition of the settlement agreement.\n\n(e) The order of the Deputy Commissioner judge of compensation claims approving or disapproving the proposed settlement shall set forth findings of fact and conclusions of law to support the approval or disapproval of the proposed settlement and may be in substantially the form provided in these rules.\n\nCommittee Notes\n\n1988 Adoption : . The rule intends to codify and standardize existing practice as to washout settlements. The accompanying forms are substantially those presently in general use.\n\nRULE 4.140. MOTION PRACTICE\n\n(a) Procedural Motions. Any matter relating to procedure or discovery may be raised by motion before the Deputy Commissioner judge of compensation claims. The motion shall be filed with the Deputy Commissioner judge of compensation claims having jurisdiction of the industrial accident, who will promptly hear and decide the issues raised by the motion after giving not less than five 5 days' written notice to all parties. Motions may be heard at any pretrial conference, provided the motion was filed and served not less than five 5 days prior to the date of the pretrial conference.\n\n(b) Motions Seeking Affirmative Relief. The Deputy Commissioner may, Judges of compensation claims, in his their discretion, may treat any motion seeking affirmative relief or the adjudication of entitlement to any benefit in the manner provided for a claim for benefits under these rules.\n\nCommittee Notes\n\n1988 Adoption : . Sub section division (a) of this rule is intended to create an expedited procedure for the disposition of motions relating to discovery and other preliminary matters not involving the adjudication of issues properly raised by claim or notice of defenses. Sub section division (b) is intended to control the adjudication of substantive motions, such as motions for change of physicians, to suspend the payment or provision of benefits, and the like.\n\nRULE 4.141. MOTION FOR REHEARING , ; VACATING , OR AMENDING Order OF DEPUTY COMMISSIONER JUDGE OF COMPENSATION CLAIMS ; RULE NISI\n\n(a) Rehearing. Any party may file with the Deputy Commissioner judge of compensation claims a motion for rehearing directed to an order not yet final by operation of S s ection 440.25, Florida Statutes. Such a motion shall state with specificity the grounds on which it is based. The filing of such motion does not toll either the time within which an order becomes final or the time within which an appeal may be filed.\n\n(b) Amending, Vacating Orders. At the Deputy Commissioner's judge of compensation claims' discretion, an order not yet final by operation of S s ection 440.25, Florida Statutes, may be either vacated or amended at either the Deputy Commissioner's judge of compensation claims' own initiative or pursuant to a motion for rehearing. Grounds for vacating an order may include circumstances in which it appears to the Deputy Commissioner judge of compensation claims that due consideration of a motion for rehearing may not be practicable within the time remaining under S s ection 440.25, Florida Statutes.\n\n(c) Effect of Appeal. Nothing in this rule shall be construed to interfere with the Deputy Commissioner's judge of compensation claims' jurisdiction to either approve of settlements or correct clerical errors, as specified under R r ules 4.160(a) of these rules 4.160(h)(3) and 4.165(g).\n\n(d) Rule Nisi. The Deputy Commissioner p P ursuant to an order of a court having jurisdiction of a proceeding to enforce an order of the Deputy Commissioner judge of compensation claims, the judge may conduct such hearings, consider such evidence, and enter such orders as may be necessary to determine any specific sums due pursuant to the order which is the subject matter of the rule nisi proceeding.\n\nCommittee Notes\n\n1984 Adoption : . This new rule affords parties a rehearing process in response to such First District Court of Appeal pronouncements as are found in Acosta Roofing Company v. Gillyard, 402 So.2d 1321 (Fla. 1st DCA 1981), and Dade American Hospital Supply v. Perez, 417 So.2d 296 (Fla. 1st DCA 1982). Though time for filing appeal is not tolled by the filing of a motion for rehearing, sub section division (b) specifically invites use of a deputy's power to vacate as a means of affording the part y's ies additional time for processing a motion for rehearing where circumstances warrant. This flexible process was deemed preferable to the tolling of the appellate filing period in every case of motion for rehearing.\n\nSub section division (b) codifies the long established practice in workers' compensation litigation . : A D d eputy C c ommissioner retains jurisdiction over an order that has not yet become final. The rule implicitly adopts the majority view in Drexel Properties, Inc. v. Brown, 443 So.2d 150 (Fla. 1st DCA 1983), giving the D d eputy C c ommissioner wide latitude in determining whether to amend or vacate an order.\n\nRULE 4.150. SANCTIONS\n\nFailure to comply with the provisions of these rules or any order of the Deputy Commissioner judge of compensation claims may subject a party to reprimand, striking of briefs or pleadings, denial of oral argument, dismissal of proceedings, imposition of costs, attorney 's fees , or such other sanctions as the Deputy Commissioner judge of compensation claims shall deem appropriate.\n\nCommittee Notes\n\n1979 Adoption : . This is new in W.C.R.P. It is derived from Florid a . Rule . of App . ellate P . rocedure 9.410, 1979.\n\nPART B. APPELLATE PROCEEDINGS\n\nRULE 4.160.

Before the record on appeal is transmitted to the district court, the judge and the district court have concurrent jurisdiction to enter orders on procedural matters.\n\nCommittee Notes\n\n1979 Adoption : . This replaces R r ule 14, 1977 W.C.R.P. It derives, in part, from § section 440.25(4)(f), Florid a . Stat ., utes ( 1979) ; and R r ules 9.040(g), 9.110(b), and 9.900, Florida Rules of Appellate Procedure , ( 1979). The appeal period is extended from 20 days to 30 days, and assignment of errors is eliminated.\n\n1980 Amendment : . The Rules Committee of the Workers' Compensation Section of the Bar is in agreement with conforming workers' compensation appellate procedures with appellate procedures involving other litigation, whenever possible. In all instances in which a conformed procedure is possible no special rules should exist. However, in some regards workers' compensation cases are unique, and this uniqueness generates special needs for workers' compensation appeals not present in appeals involving other litigation. One of these is a need for the parties and the C c ourts to know precisely what is on appeal in a workers' compensation case so that those issues not on appeal may be determined in separate proceedings, those pursuant to R r ule 20 (relating to proceedings before the D d eputy in regard to matters over which jurisdiction has not been divested by the filing of an appeal). The information concerning what is on appeal is necessary to avoid delay in the delivery of uncontested (on appeal) benefits to the claimant.\n\nWorkers' compensation cases, of necessity, are taken up piecemeal. A workers' compensation case requires this treatment because the various entitlements of the claimant (which generate potential issues to be heard by the D d eputy C c ommissioner) mature at different times as the course of the claimant's physical recovery progresses. A workers' compensation case, unlike other personal injury litigation, can engender successive issues as to medical treatment, the entitlement to temporary disability benefits, the entitlement to permanent disability benefits, as well as ancillary issues of penalties, costs, attorney fees and some other rather exotic issues. These can result in successive hearings and successive orders which are all equally final, and all equally appealable. This is not only necessitated by the nature of a workers' compensation case but also is required by the S s tatute and the existing rules which allow claims and trials of only the matured issues. (See in this regard F.S. section 440.25, Florida Statutes, and existing Workers' Compensation Rule of Procedure 7.) This of course is different from other sorts of personal injury litigation in which the matter is tried at one time, and all issues are presented. For other sorts of litigation, the notice of appeal currently found in R r ule 16 is sufficient. The parties know what is being appealed, and even if they don't, it makes little difference since no additional trials are contemplated.\n\nThe special need of the parties and the C c ourts involved in a workers' compensation case to know what is on appeal, and what jurisdiction the D d eputy C c commissioner retains, was formerly met by the A a pplication for R r eview requirements for appeals to the Industrial Relations Commission. This requirement was done away with by the current R r ule 16, after the Industrial Relations Commission was abolished by S s tatute.\n\nThe Rules Committee of the Workers' Compensation Section does not recommend reinstituting the A a pplication for R r eview procedure to delineate the issues on appeal. However, it is suggested that certain changes be made in the existing R r ule 16 in recognition of the special need in workers' compensation cases of an expeditious means of determination of just where it is that jurisdiction lies. As the rule now stands, between the date of the filing of the notice of appeal and the date of the filing of the record on appeal, the F f irst D d istrict has nothing which would allow it to make such a determination. For this reason, it is suggested that a certified copy of the order appealed should be attached to and transmitted with the notice of appeal, and that the notice itself advise the C c ourt of the date of accident in question. The S s ection further suggests a certificate of the appellant setting out which benefits will be affected by the issues on appeal, so that the D d eputy can determine whether he has jurisdiction to proceed in regard to other benefits. The certificate does not require a pleading of the issues on appeal, but rather only requires a certification of which benefits will be affected. It is felt that such an amendment to the rule will do much to avoid confusion and delay in determining the threshold question of the D d eputy's jurisdiction.\n\n1984 Revision: Amendment. Provides that both the D d istrict C c ourt of A a ppeal and the D d eputy may accept notices of appeal.\n\nJurisdiction before the filing of the record on appeal is retained by the D d eputy in regard to certain administrative tasks and no remand of jurisdiction from the D d istrict C c ourt is necessary.\n\nThe final sentence of sub -section division (a) complements the new R r ule 4.161, and is intended to avoid possible confusion over jurisdiction to determine whether there has been an \"abandonment\" in what are presumed by the committee to be those rare circumstances in which \"abandonment\" is not plainly apparent.\n\n1992 Amendment. This rule combines prior rules 4.160, 4.200, and 4.210 to follow the form of the Florida Rules of Appellate Procedure.\n\nSubdivision (b) is derived from Florida Rule of Appellate Procedure 9.130.\n\nSubdivision (e) duplicates rule 4.220(b) and is similar to Florida Rule of Appellate Procedure 9.130(e).\n\nSubdivision (f) is from former rule 4.210(a).\n\nSubdivision (g) is from former rule 4.200(b)(3).\n\nSubdivision (h) is from former rule 4.210(a).\n\nSubdivision (i) is from former rule 4.200(b)(2).\n\nSubdivision (j) is from former rule 4.210(b), (c), and (d).\n\nSubdivision (k) is similar to former rule 4.200(a).\n\nRULE 4.161. EFFECT OF APPEAL ON BENEFITS AWARDED\n\n(a) Benefits Unaffected By Appeal. Benefits ordered paid and not certified by appellant (or cross-appellant) to be affected by appeal under Rule 4.160(a) of these rules are governed by Section 440.20, Florida Statutes.\n\n(b) Benefits Affected By Appeal. Benefits ordered paid which are certified under Rule 4.160(a) of these rules by appellant (or cross-appellant) as being affected by the appeal may be withheld pending outcome of the appeal under the authority of Section 440.20, Florida Statutes, unless the appellant's (or cross-appellant's) challenge to the award of any such benefits so certified is deemed abandoned as provided by subsection (c) of this rule.\n\n(c) Abandonment. Any challenge to benefits certified as affected by appeal under Rule 4.160(a) of these rules, but not raised, argued or encompassed in appellant's (or cross-appellant's) initial brief, shall be deemed abandoned by the appellant (or cross-appellant).\n\n(d) Payment of Benefits Where Challenge Is Abandoned. Where any certification affecting benefits challenged on appeal under Rule 4.160(a) of these rules is deemed abandoned under subsection (c) of this rule, benefits no longer affected by the appeal are payable and due within 30 days of service of the initial brief deemed to have abandoned the challenge to benefits previously certified as affected by appeal, together with interest, as provided under Section 440.20 Florida Statutes, from the date of entry of the Deputy's order making the award.\n\n(e) Payment of Benefits After Unsuccessful Appeal. Benefits ordered paid which have been certified as being affected by appeal pursuant to Rule 4.160(a) of these rules and withheld pending outcome of appeal become due and payable if appeal is unsuccessful with respect to any such withheld benefits, within 30 days of the issuance of the district court's mandate unless stay is obtained, pursuant to review sought with the Florida Supreme Court, in which case benefits become due, if such review is unsuccessful, within 30 days of the Supreme Court's final disposition of the cause, together with interest as provided under Section 440.20, Florida Statutes, from the date of entry of the Deputy's order making the award.\n\n(a) Benefits Affected. Those benefits specifically referenced under rule 4.165(c) shall be withheld pending the outcome of the appeal. Otherwise, benefits awarded shall be paid as required by law.\n\n(b) Abandonment. If the appellant or cross-appellant fails to argue entitlement to benefits set forth in the notice of appeal in the appellant's or cross-appellant's initial brief, the challenge to such benefits shall be deemed abandoned.\n\n(c) Payments of Benefits when Challenged Benefits are Abandoned. When benefits challenged on appeal have been abandoned under subdivision (b) above, benefits no longer affected by the appeal are payable within 30 days of the service of the brief together with interest as required under section 440.20, Florida Statutes, from the date of the order of the judge of compensation claims making the award.\n\n(d) Payment of Benefits after Appeal. If benefits are ordered paid by the district court on completion of the appeal, they shall be paid, together with interest as required under section 440.20, Florida Statutes, within 30 days after the court's mandate. If the order of the district court is appealed to the supreme court, benefits determined due by the district court may be stayed in accordance with the applicable Florida Rules of Appellate Procedure. Benefits ordered paid by the supreme court shall be paid within 30 days of the court's mandate.\n\nCommittee Notes\n\n1984 Adoption : . This comprehensive new rule is intended by the rules committee to clarify within the context of existing authority the status of benefits ordered paid where an appeal is taken, which may or may not have an impact on all benefits awarded, from inception through final disposition of appeal.\n\nThe rule codifies authority to the effect benefits certified as being challenged on appeal may be withheld pending disposition on appeal, provided, however, the appellant may either relinquish or forfeit this privilege by abandoning a contemplated challenge to benefits awarded. There are two consequences of an abandonment during the pendency of an appeal with respect to any benefit previously certified as affected by appeal. First, payment of the previously challenged award becomes due under the time table specified under sub section division (d) of this rule. The second consequence is jurisdiction reverts back to the D d eputy C c ommissioner under R r ule 4.200(b)(3) (formerly Rule 20) over any matter no longer encompassed by an appeal where jurisdiction would otherwise have been suspended by operation of the certification previously in force.\n\nSub section division (c) defines abandonment. Counsel are encouraged to utilize this procedure [which complements the \"certification\" process of R r ule 4.160(a) (formerly R r ule 16)] as a means of withdrawing an issue from contention and of expediting payment of benefits during the pendency of an appeal where further reflection (often aided by study of the record on appeal) suggests that an award originally thought to be erroneous may not be reversible as a practical matter.\n\nThe language \"not raised, argued or encompassed\" in appellant's initial brief is broad so as to avoid dispute in cases where an award may be \"encompassed\" by an argument (such as the award of an expert witness fee in appeal directed to the threshold issue of \"course of employment\"). Obviously, the better practice is to be as explicit as practicable so as to avoid dispute. The D d eputy does retain jurisdiction under R r ule 4.160(a) to make a determination as to whether or not there has been an abandonment, in those unique instances in which the parties cannot otherwise agree.\n\nThough not specifically encompassed by the rule, it is the committee's belief that a full voluntary dismissal of appeal, implicitly permissible in workers' compensation appeals, would, with respect to status and time for payment of benefits withheld pending appeal, operate effectively as an \"abandonment\" under this rule.\n\nSub section division (d) clarifies the time within which payments are to be made following either an abandonment or unsuccessful disposition of appeal. As in all other cases, enforcement in case of default is governed by section 440.24, Florida Statutes.\n\n1992 Amendment. Rule 4.161(b). As envisioned by the committee, if an appellant or cross-appellant failed to assert an argument in support of a particular class or time period of benefits previously referenced in the notice of appeal, the issue involving entitlement shall be deemed abandoned. The party asserting abandonment should file a motion with the judge who originally heard the case and has specific authority under rule 4.160(h)(4) to determine whether an issue affecting benefits has been abandoned.\n\nRULE 4.165. NOTICE OF APPEAL\n\n(a) Procedure. An order of a judge of compensation claims may be appealed to the district court by filing a written notice of appeal with the district court or with any judge of compensation claims within 30 days from the date the judge's order is mailed to the parties. If the notice is filed with the district court, a copy shall be served on the judge who entered the order.\n\n(b) Insolvency: Notice to Division. If a party seeks relief of any appellate costs due to insolvency, a copy of the notice and verified petition of insolvency shall be mailed to the division and to the general counsel for the department.\n\n(c) Contents of Notice. In addition to a reference to the order appealed, the notice shall contain a brief summary of the type of benefits affected including a statement setting forth the time periods involved.\n\n(d) Form of Notice.\n\nIn the Office of The Judge of Compensation Claims\n\nDistrict . . .

The notice of appeal shall be accompanied by an appropriate filing fee as set by law unless relief is sought under rule 4.180(g) and section 57.081(1), Florida Statutes.\n\n(f) Transmittal of Notice and Fee. If the notice is filed with a judge, the judge shall transmit a certified copy of the notice and filing fee to the clerk of the district court. If the judge transmitting the notice is not the judge who entered the order appealed, a copy of the notice of appeal shall be forwarded to the judge who signed the order appealed.\n\n(g) Jurisdiction. The district court acquires jurisdiction when the notice of appeal is filed. However, at any time before the record on appeal is filed with the district court under rule 4.180(i), the judge also shall have the authority to approve settlements or correct clerical errors in the order appealed. The judge also shall have the authority to determine if an issue has been abandoned under rule 4.161(b).\n\n(h) Cross-Appeal. Notice of cross-appeal shall be filed with any judge within 10 days of service of the notice of appeal or within 30 days after mailing of the order to be reviewed, whichever is later.

There shall be no assignment or cross-assignment of error.\n\n(j) Proof of Service. A copy of the notice of appeal or cross-appeal shall be served on all interested parties.\n\nCommittee Notes\n\n1992 Adoption. Rule 4.165(d). The list of benefits set forth in the Notice of Appeal form is illustrative and not intended to be comprehensive. The primary purpose of requiring a list of benefits in dispute on appeal is to allow for a clear determination of what has been abandoned under rule 4.161(b). Note that abandonment can apply to issues raised in a cross-appeal.\n\nRULE 4.166. INTERVENTION BY DIVISION\n\n(a) Notice and Order to Division and General Counsel. The judge of compensation claims shall send a copy of the notice and a certified copy of the order to the division and to the general counsel for the department.\n\n(b) Intervention by Division: District Court.

If an order of the district court is appealed to the supreme court, the division may intervene in accordance with the applicable Florida Rules of Appellate Procedure. The clerk of the supreme court shall provide a copy of the notice of appeal to the division.\n\n(d) Division Not a Party Until Motion to Intervene is Granted. Until the motion to intervene is granted, the division shall not be considered a party.\n\nRULE 4.170. APPROVAL OF APPEAL BONDS\n\nAny employer required to file a supersedeas bond in an appeal shall file the bond with the deputy who shall promptly serve notice on each party of the approval or disapproval of the bond. A notice of disapproval shall include the reasons for the disapproval. A party whose bond is disapproved is allowed 10 days from service of notice of disapproval to comply with the objections contained in the notice of disapproval. The bond shall be conditioned to pay the amount of the demand, interest, penalties, and costs payable under the terms of the order, if the appeal shall be dismissed or the District Court shall affirm the award in any amount. Failure to file a required bond or to comply with objections contained in a notice of disapproval within the time allowed shall be grounds for dismissal of the appeal.\n\n(a) Authority. When required by statute, the judge of compensation claims, the district court of appeal, or the supreme court shall fix the terms and conditions of a good and sufficient appellate bond.\n\n(b) Bond Defined. A good and sufficient bond is defined as a bond issued by a surety company authorized to do business in Florida or a principal and 2 personal sureties.\n\n(c) Condition. The bond shall be conditioned to pay the compensation ordered by the judge or district court including interest, penalties, costs, and fees. The bond also shall provide that the surety company or principal and personal sureties shall submit themselves to the jurisdiction of the judge and appropriate reviewing body.\n\n(d) Notice of Disapproval. If a bond is disapproved, the judge, district court, or supreme court shall provide written notice of disapproval, which shall include specific reasons for rejecting the bond. A party whose bond is disapproved shall have 10 days from the service of the notice to comply with objections contained in the notice of disapproval.\n\n(e) Failure to Provide Bond. Failure to provide the required bond or comply with objections contained in the notice of disapproval within the time allowed herein shall be grounds for dismissal of the appeal.\n\n(f) Review. Orders entered under this rule by the judge shall be subject to review by the district court. District court orders under this rule are subject to review by the supreme court.\n\nCommittee Notes\n\n1979 Adoption . . This replaces R r ule 15, 1977 W.C.R.P. § Sections 440.27(2) and § 440.25(4)(a), Fla.Stat., Florida Statutes ( 1979), were the statutory foundations through September 30, 1979.\n\nRULE 4.180. RECORD ON APPEAL\n\n(a) What Constitutes.\n\n(1) The record on appeal shall contain the claim, notice to controvert, pretrial order and stipulation, transcript of proceedings before the Deputy, and order on appeal. The record also shall contain, by designation of a party, such other orders and pleadings as are necessary for the court's determination of the appeal. Only such exhibits, depositions, and physical evidence as are introduced into evidence before the Deputy, designated by the parties for inclusion, and necessary for the court's determination of the appeal shall be included. If the order appealed requires consideration by the Court of matters which have not been admitted as evidence, such material as is necessary to the Court's determination shall be included by designation. Evidence proffered, but not admitted into evidence by the deputy, shall not be included in the record unless its admissibility is an issue on appeal and it is designated for inclusion by one of the parties.\n\n(2) The record on appeal from a non-final order shall consist of the order on appeal and only such material, designated by the parties, as is necessary for the court's determination of the appeal.\n\n(3) Designation shall be filed with the Deputy and served by appellant within 10 days, and by appellee within 20 days, of service of notice of appeal.\n\n(4) The Deputy shall certify the record as constituting the appellate record in the proceedings.\n\n(b) Abbreviated Record. Within the time provided for filing the notice of appeal, the appellant may file designations to the deputy identifying those portions of the proceedings and evidence appellant wishes to have omitted as unnecessary from the record on appeal. Appellant or cross-appellant shall serve a copy of the designation, a statement of the issues on appeal, and proof of service thereof, on each opposing party. Within 10 days after service of designations, each opposing party may file cross-designations identifying any parts of the omitted record deemed necessary and they shall be included in the record on appeal. Each opposing party shall serve a copy of those cross-designations, and in the case of a cross-appeal, a statement of issues on cross-appeal, together with proof of service thereof, on each other opposing party.\n\n(c) Stipulated Record. When the issues on appeal can be determined without an examination of the entire proceedings in the cause, the parties may prepare a stipulated statement showing how the issues to be presented arose and were decided by the deputy, setting forth or attaching as much of the record before the deputy as is necessary to a determination of the issues by the District Court. A stipulated statement and a copy of the deputy's order then may be certified by the deputy as the record on appeal.\n\n(d) Incomplete Record. If the District Court of its own motion or on motion of any party finds the record is incomplete, it shall direct a party to supply the omitted parts of the record. No proceeding shall be determined because the record is incomplete until an opportunity to supplement the record has been given.\n\n(e) Costs. Within 5 days after the content of the record on appeal has been determined, the deputy shall serve notice upon the appellant or his attorney of the estimated cost of preparing the record on appeal and necessary copies thereof, and the appellant shall, within 15 days of the date of service, deposit the amount of the estimated cost of preparing the record at the office of the deputy. If the appellant fails to deposit the amount of cost within the time allotted, the deputy shall promptly notify the District Court of such failure and the District Court may dismiss the notice of appeal. However, neither the division, nor the Special Disability Trust Fund, nor any self-insured state agency shall be required to make the deposit.\n\n(f) Relief from Costs.\n\n(1) An appellant may be relieved from payment of any necessary filing fee by filing a Verified Petition of Indigency for approval as provided in Section 57.081(1), Florida Statutes.\n\n(2) An appellant may be relieved in part or in whole from the costs for the preparation of the record on appeal, if within 15 days after the date notice of the estimated costs for the preparation is served, he files with the Deputy a verified petition to be relieved of costs. The verified petition for record costs shall contain a detailed and sworn statement of all his assets, liabilities, and income. Appellant's attorney or the appellant, if not represented by an attorney, shall include as a part of the verified petition for record costs an affidavit or affirmation that in his opinion the notice of appeal was filed in good faith and that there is a probable basis for the District Court to find reversible error. A copy of the verified petition for record costs shall be served on the Division in Tallahassee and all other interested parties, and the Clerk. The Deputy shall promptly conduct a hearing on the verified petition giving at least 15 days notice to the appellant, the Division, and all other interested parties, which shall all be parties to the proceeding. The Deputy may enter an order without such hearing if no objection is filed by the Division or an interested party within 12 days from the date the verified petition for record costs is filed. Said proceedings shall be conducted in accordance with the Workers' Compensation Rules of Procedure to the extent applicable. The 60 day period for the preparation and filing of the record on appeal and, in the case of a denial of said petition, the 15-day period for depositing the amount of record costs required, will then commence when the Deputy's order thereon has become final (with an information copy provided to the Division and the District Court). In the event an insolvency petition is granted, the Deputy may provide for payment of the record costs from the Workers' Compensation Administration Trust Fund pending final disposition of the costs of appeal by a court or Deputy Commissioner.\n\n(g) Preparation of Record. Upon direction from the Deputy, the court reporter who stenographically reported the proceedings, or a transcriber designated by the deputy, shall transcribe, prepare, certify, and deliver to the deputy a record on appeal prepared in accordance with this rule. The court reporter or transcriber shall deliver the record on appeal to the Deputy in sufficient time to allow review and certification by the deputy and timely filing with the District Court. The court reporter or transcriber shall promptly notify the parties in writing of the date of such delivery. The Deputy or the District Court may, of its own motion, or on motion of a party, secure compliance with this section by invoking the sanction powers provided by law.\n\n(h) Format. The record on appeal shall be bound and securely fastened in one or more volumes containing no more than 200 pages per volume. The pages of the record shall be numbered consecutively, and each volume shall include a cover page, the volume number, and a complete index containing the names of the witnesses, a list of exhibits offered and introduced in evidence, including the pages where offered and where each may be found. Volume one shall include a complete index of the entire record on appeal. Proffered evidence, subject to (a) above, shall be clearly identified and located in a separate section of the record on appeal.\n\n(i) Time to File. The appellant shall, pursuant to the directions of the Deputy, have the original or a copy of the record on appeal filed with the District Court within 60 days from the date of filing of the notice of appeal, unless the Deputy Commissioner for good cause shown by petition filed prior to the expiration of said period, and after notice and opportunity for hearing, shall extend the time therefor. The appellant shall have a copy of the record on appeal served on each party or its attorney, and shall have a certificate of such service filed with the record on appeal when filed with the District Court. Unless the nature of the litigation dictates otherwise, service of a copy of the record on appeal on any one of the following: (1) the employer, (2) attorney for employer, (3) the carrier or servicing agent, (4) attorney for carrier or servicing agent shall be service of a copy of the record on appeal on the employer and carrier.\n\n(a) Contents: Final Orders.\n\n(1) Transcript, Order, and Other Documents. The record shall contain the claim, notices to controvert, pretrial stipulation, pretrial order, transcripts of any hearings before the judge of compensation claims, and the order appealed. By designation of the parties, the record also shall contain such other exhibits, orders, depositions, transcripts, and physical evidence introduced into evidence at the hearing. The district court may consider matters not introduced into evidence if it is necessary for the determination of the issues on appeal. Evidence proffered but not introduced into evidence at the hearing shall not be considered unless its admissibility is an issue on appeal and the question is properly designated for inclusion in the record by a party.\n\n(2) Designated Matters. Within 10 days from the date the notice of appeal is filed, the appellant shall designate in writing what matters are to be included in the record on appeal and certify a copy of such designation to appellee. The judge may for good cause extend the time for filing the designation. Within 10 days after service of the appellant's designation but no later than 20 days after filing of the notice of appeal, the appellee shall designate in writing additional matters to be included in the record on appeal. Any extension of time given the appellant shall automatically extend the time to file the appellee's designation.\n\n(3) Certification and Transmittal. The judge shall certify and transmit the record to the district court as prescribed by these rules.\n\n(b) Contents: Nonfinal Orders.\n\n(1) Order. The record shall contain the order on appeal and such other items essential to the district court's determination of the appeal.\n\n(2) Brief and Appendix.

The appellant shall serve a copy of the verified petition on the division, the office of general counsel of the department, the clerk of the district court, and all parties.\n\n(E) Hearing on Petition to be Relieved of Costs. After giving 15 days' notice to the division and all parties, the judge shall promptly hold a hearing and rule on the merits of the petition to be relieved of costs. However, if no objection to the petition is filed by the division or a party within 12 days after the petition is filed, the judge may enter an order on the merits of the petition without a hearing.\n\n(F) Extension of Appeal Deadlines: Petition Granted. If the petition to be relieved of the entire cost of the preparation of the record on appeal is granted, the 60-day period allowed under these rules for the preparation of the record shall begin to run from the date of the order granting the petition.\n\n(G) Extension of Appeal Deadlines: Petition Denied. If the petition to be relieved of the cost of the record is denied or only granted in part, the petitioner shall deposit the estimated costs with the judge within 15 days from the date the order denying the petition is entered. The 60-day period allowed under these rules for the preparation of the record shall begin from the date the estimated cost is deposited with the judge.\n\n(H) Payment of Cost for Preparation of Record by Administration Trust Fund. If the petition to be relieved of costs is granted, the judge may order the Workers' Compensation Administration Trust Fund to pay the cost of the preparation of the record on appeal pending the final disposition of the appeal.\n\n(I) Reimbursement of Administration Trust Fund If Appeal Is Successful. If the Administration Trust Fund has paid the costs of the preparation of the record and the appellant prevails at the conclusion of the appeal, the appellee shall reimburse the Fund the costs paid within 30 days of the mandate issued by the district court or supreme court under these rules.\n\n(h) Preparation of Record.\n\n(1) Selection of Reporter by Judge.

If the employer, carrier, or servicing agent is not represented by an attorney, the appellant need only serve the employer or the carrier, or the servicing agent.\n\nCommittee Notes\n\n1979 Adoption : . This replaces R r ule 16, 1977 W.C.R.P. The subsection applicable to non-final nonfinal orders is new. The earlier rule provided designations for the purpose of excluding portions of the proceedings . . . t . T his rule reverses that concept, and one must now designate those portions of the proceedings which are to be included.\n\n1980 Amendment : . 18.(a) This change is intended to conform the rules to the legislative mandate (or comport with the legislative intent) set out in F.S. section 440.29(2), Florida Statutes, which requires hearings before the D d eputy C c ommissioner to be reported and authorizes the D d ivision to contract for the reporting of the hearing. Current practice and procedure is apparently inconsistent, with some districts employing court reporters and others not. The Rules Committee of the Workers' Compensation Section has been advised of several instances in which the record on appeal has been inadequate for purposes of deciding the appeal, resulting in some cases in irreparable damage and, in others, of unnecessary expense involving de novo proceedings. [The amendment described herein was deleted upon rehearing in order of December 19, 1980.]\n\n18. (f) The changes are intended to relieve the insolvent appellant of the costs of the newly imposed filing fee for the appeal to the First District Court of Appeal. There previously was no filing fee to the Industrial Relations Commission and no reason to provide for relief from that cost. Since the division bears the cost of the preparation of the record in cases of total or partial insolvency of the appellant, it should also bear the cost of the filing of the appeal.\n\n18. (i) The change in sub paragraph division (i) provides that the D d eputy C c ommissioner, who still has physical possession of the file and can more easily handle the ministerial duties involving the record, should deal with any extensions required for filing the record.\n\n1984 Revision: Amendment. 18(a)(1) Redundant language deleted. Earlier language in 18(a)(1) discusses what is to be included in the record.\n\n18(f)(1) (New) Conforms Workers' Compensation to general appellate practice, implementing section 47.081(1), Florida Statutes.\n\n18(f)( d 2) (Newly Numbered) Clarifies language in conformity with Florida Workers' Compensation Rules of Procedure 18(f)(1) to distinguish between filing fees and record costs.\n\nRULE 4.190. CORRECTIONS TO RECORD\n\n(a) Corrections. After the record has been transmitted by the Deputy, the District Court may on its own motion or motion of any party temporarily relinquish jurisdiction to the Deputy for the purpose of correcting, amending, or supplementing the record to reflect the true state of the record, with costs of the record to be assessed by the deputy. The Deputy shall certify the corrected, amended, or supplemented record to the District Court as the record on appeal. Absent specific directions from the District Court, if the Deputy determines, on remand, that the record as originally certified is correct, he shall so state, whereupon jurisdiction shall revest in the District Court.\n\n(b) Costs. If the responsible party fails to deposit the additional costs within the time ordered by the Deputy, or in the case of a denial of Petition to be Relieved of Costs, within 15 days after the date of the Deputy's order, the Deputy shall promptly notify the District Court and the parties thereof.\n\n(a) Corrections. After the record has been filed with the district court, the court may temporarily relinquish jurisdiction to the judge to correct, amend, or supplement the record. If the judge of compensation claims determines that the original record is correct, the judge shall so state and recertify the record to the district court. If the record is corrected, amended, or supplemented, the judge shall promptly recertify the new record to the district court.\n\n(b) Costs. If additional costs are incurred in correcting, amending, or supplementing the record, the judge shall assess such costs against the appropriate party. If the division is obligated to pay the costs of the appeal due to appellant's indigency, it must be given notice of any proceeding to assess additional costs. Within 15 days after the entry of the order assessing costs, the assessed party must deposit the sums so ordered with the judge. The judge shall promptly notify the district court if costs are not deposited as required.\n\nCommittee Notes\n\n1979 Adoption : . This replaces R r ule 17, 1977 W.C.R.P.\n\nRULE 4.200. PROCEEDINGS PENDING REVIEW\n\n(a) Procedural Matters. Before the record is transmitted, the deputy shall have concurrent jurisdiction with the District Court to enter orders on any procedural matter relating to the cause, subject to the control of the District Court on its motion or that of a party.\n\n(b) Further Proceedings.\n\n(1) In the absence of a stay, during the pendency of a review of a non-final order, the Deputy may proceed with all matters, including final hearing; provided that the Deputy may not enter a final order disposing of the cause pending such appeal.\n\n(2) When the jurisdiction of the Deputy has been divested by an appeal from a final order, the court by order may permit the deputy to proceed with specifically stated matters during the pendency of the appeal.\n\n(3) Pending appeal the Deputy shall retain jurisdiction to enter orders on all matters of the claim which have not been appealed.\n\nCommittee Notes\n\n1979 Adoption: Subsection (a) is similar to a portion of Rule 18(a), 1977 W.C.R.P.\n\nSubsection (b)(1) is similar to Rule 9.130(f), Florida Rules of Appellate Procedure.\n\nSubsection (b)(2) is similar to Rule 9.600(b), Florida Rules of Appellate Procedure.\n\nRULE 4.210. JURISDICTION; PROPOSED SETTLEMENT; MOTION FOR REMAND; APPELLATE COSTS\n\n(a) Jurisdiction. Upon application to the District Court for review of an order of a Deputy, jurisdiction of the cause to the extent of the issues raised is vested in the District Court and the Deputy shall have no further jurisdiction, in respect thereof, save with respect to preparation of the record on appeal, cost of said preparation, extension of time for filing of same, and with respect to a stipulation, settlement or correction of clerical errors in the order appealed prior to filing of the record, or as provided by these rules. A party may, however, file a motion with the District Court requesting remand of the cause to the Deputy for further proceedings.\n\n(b) Proposed Settlement. Upon stipulation of the parties, the Deputy may take testimony or cause to be investigated a proposal for settlement of all or any part of the cause before the District Court on review with the objective of determining whether or not on remand, he would approve such settlement proposal.

The form is intended for use only as to claims arising under C chapter 440, Florida Statutes, and a separate agreement must be obtained for representation as to any other cause of action.\n\n1992 Amendment. The alternative form of agreement reflects the amendment to chapter 440, Florida Statutes (1989), eliminating the provision for the award of attorney fees on account of \"bad faith\" and substituting a timely payment requirement (the \"21-day rule\"). It is the view of this committee, being mindful of the customary practice under the prior (pre-1979) \"21-day rule,\" that many of these agreements will not be submitted to the judge for approval inasmuch as the attorney will not undertake to withhold money from the claimant's benefits to secure the payment of a fee.\n\nRULE 4.904.Order APPROVING CONTRACT OF REPRESENTATION AND DIRECTING PAYMENT OF BENEFITS\n\n[For caption and style of pleadings see form 4.901]\n\nOrder APPROVING CONTRACT OF REPRESENTATION AND DIRECTING PAYMENT OF BENEFITS\n\nThe motion to approve the contract of representation having come before the undersigned ex parte, and having reviewed the contract of representation entered into between the attorney for the employee and the employee providing for the retention of certain monies in trust and requesting that the employer/carrier make payment of benefits to the attorney for the employee on behalf of the employee; it is,\n\nOrdered AND ADJUDGED:\n\n1.
