    "body": "According to Amanda, the camera was big. There were three lights which were not on stands.\n\nWindy testified that on one occasion, there were three cameras present. One had a strap on it that could go around the user's neck. Another had a stand. The third had a strap that could go around the user's hand. The camera with the neck strap ejected a picture when a button was pushed. The camera on the stand had wires around it. The third camera was small. There were also three bright lights on tables. The camera stand had four\n\nlegs and wires going up to the camera and back down. There was nothing covering its operator, like a hood.\n\nBrian testified to a big camera and a small one. According to one portion of his testimony, there were two lights on the big camera. They were not on anything else. They were bright. This camera was on a stand with three legs and stood about four feet high. There were wires on the camera which hooked onto the light. The light was big and long, and the camera was not taken off of its legs during use. According to a different portion of testimony, the bright lights were on their own stand, which consisted of a long pole with a square bottom. The pole was round. Pictures came out of the small camera right away. One light was on the big camera and one was on the little camera. On one occasion, Brian saw a camera with a black hood. The operator would have his face under the hood while taking pictures.\n\nJohnny described a camera that was on a stand. The operator could look through it, aim it at people, and film them. The stand had four wheels on the bottom, was about as big as a refrigerator, and had three floors. It was square. The camera could be set on it and pushed around, or the camera could be held. The camera had cords coming out of it that were connected to a box in the same room as the camera. There was also a smaller camera that took snapshots and was not on a stand. Johnny never saw pictures come out of the small camera. There were also two or three lights which were different from ordinary lights. Each was on a stand and had a handle where they could be pushed around. The stands were the same as for the camera and had wheels. The lights did not change the room's temperature, although all three were on at the same time.\n\nSome of these descriptions fit Idolina's and/or Bobby's descriptions, and some did not. In any event, all of the witnesses described standard photographic equipment. None of the equipment was distinctive enough to permit a reasonable inference that the same equipment was used in both instances, especially given the fact that all of the defendants except Forsythe were in jail at the time of the alleged Knotts Street occurrences, and over a year had elapsed between those occurrences and what went on at the green house.\n\nEven the descriptions of the board, the most unique piece of equipment used, diverged wildly. As noted, Bobby described a brown board with sticks and nails and three or six white ropes. Christine never saw the board used, but saw a rope on it. The handcuffs were on a nail in the wall, not on the board itself. Tommy described the board as being long with black straps connected to it. According to Amanda, there were handcuffs on the board and children were hung up. The handcuffs were nailed to the board. The\n\nboard had one piece of rope on it and one strap, which was white. Brian said the board and ropes were black, red, and yellow. The board was approximately three feet by three feet. The children would be tied to it with one rope on their arms, one on the middle of their bodies, and one on their legs. At one point, Brian testified that all three of the ropes were black, and at least one was tied to the board as opposed to being nailed to it. There were no straps on the board. Johnny described the board as being brown and about six feet long by three feet wide. There were straps attached to it and little metal handles to hold the straps down. There were about five straps, which Johnny thought were red. Later in his testimony, Johnny described the straps as being made of cloth. Some were all red and some were all blue. They were tied to the board, not nailed.\n\nUnder these circumstances, the area 1 evidence was irrelevant as to all defendants, including Forsythe.\n\nThere remains the question of prejudice, which is analyzed under the standard of People v. Watson, supra,46 Cal. 2d at page 836. The area 1 evidence, considered alone, was prejudicial because it permitted the jury to infer conspiracy, and bolstered the credibility of the green house children, although the evidence was inadmissible for those purposes.\n\nMore importantly, the jury also heard the area 2 evidence. Granted, the jury was admonished that said evidence was only to be considered as to Forsythe. Where the jury is instructed that evidence is admitted only as to certain counts or defendants, it is ordinarily presumed the jury followed that instruction. However, that is not always the case. (People v. Foote (1957) 48 Cal. 2d 20, 23-24 [306 P.2d 803].) The reality of the overwhelming prejudicial effect of the evidence as to each defendant in the instant case is that, assuming the jury accepted the testimony of Idolina Lopez and Bobby R., they would conclude that Forsythe committed the Knotts Street molestations; if Forsythe committed the Knotts Street molestations, he was also guilty of the green house molestations; if he was guilty of the green house molestations, the green house children were telling the truth regarding Forsythe; if they were telling the truth regarding Forsythe, it follows they were telling the truth regarding everyone else. Under such circumstances, the limiting instruction was inherently insufficient, and there was no way the jury could, in actuality, consider the area 2 evidence only as to Forsythe. This precise argument was made to the trial court prior to admission of Idolina's testimony. Inexplicably, the court found it \"premature.\"\n\nThe problems with the limiting instruction were compounded by Vendrasco's opening argument. At one point, Vendrasco was pointing out evidence\n\nthat corroborated the victims. Point 14 on his list was the testimony of Idolina Lopez. Although he reiterated that the evidence could only be used against Forsythe, Vendrasco described the acts to which Idolina testified and argued that they were very similar to what the green house children said: \"The orgies were also committed in a very small room as Idol[i]na described the size of the room similar to Rick and Tutti's room. Very similar to our case. And the people that weren't engaged in molesting were watching this same sort of thing that all the kids said happened in our case . . . .\"\n\nLater, Vendrasco showed the jury a chart which referred to the informations filed against all defendants but Forsythe. The chart contained the reporters' transcript page numbers for testimony regarding each count and showed the People's election as to each. Count 14 was a child pornography charge. According to Vendrasco, proof of count 14 was made by Johnny's testimony the acts were filmed and photographed, his testimony regarding the tape having a voice-over, Tyler's testimony, Linda Moten's testimony regarding statements made by Colleen, and Idolina's testimony that Forsythe told Stephanie and Melvin they were going to make good money with the pictures. Although Idolina's testimony about the statements was in evidence, it was area 2 evidence that was only to be considered against Forsythe. Yet Vendrasco argued it as proof of a charge made against all other defendants.\n\nAs to count 23, another child pornography charge against all defendants but Forsythe, Vendrasco again argued Forsythe's statements as proof. When Rubin objected, Vendrasco asserted that Idolina's testimony was limited to Forsythe, but objections to her answers regarding the statements were overruled at the time she testified. Gindes noted that her testimony was in fact limited to Forsythe, to which the trial court responded, \"That's my understanding. Overruled.\" Vendrasco then stated, \"This information deals with all the defendants but Wayne Forsythe, but Wayne Forsythe was charged with a lot of these same offenses that I'm not going to repeat in his chart. So, it actually deals with him too, a lot of these same charges.\" The trial court answered, \"All right.\" The jurors had to have been hopelessly confused as to what evidence they could consider against whom. Later standard instructions about evidence admitted for a limited purpose could not have cured the harm.\n\nAccordingly, reversal is required on this issue as to all defendants.\n\nFor guidance of the trial court in case of a retrial, we express no opinion as to whether the Knotts Street evidence will be admissible against Forsythe, since we do not know if his identity will actually be placed in dispute.\n\nWe likewise express no opinion as to whether the Knotts Street and green house incidents share sufficient marks of similarity so as to render the Knotts Street evidence admissible under Evidence Code section 1101, subdivision (b) as modus operandi evidence from which identity could reasonably be inferred (see, e.g., People v. Bean (1988) 46 Cal. 3d 919, 937 [251 Cal. Rptr. 467, 760 P.2d 996], cert. den. U.S. [108 L.Ed.2d 634,110 S.Ct. 1499]), assuming identity is actually placed in dispute. If the Knotts Street evidence is determined to be admissible against Forsythe, serious consideration should be given to ordering a separate trial for him.\n\nIII.\n\nAdmission of Jail Statements\n\nDefendants object on various grounds to the admission at trial of statements allegedly made by some of the defendants while they were in jail.\n\nA. Testimony of Laurancia Lopez (hereinafter referred to as Laurancia, in order to distinguish her from Idolina Lopez)\n\nExcept as otherwise noted, Laurancia's testimony was admitted against all defendants over timely defense objection. Defendants contend the trial court erred in admitting this testimony because Laurancia was a police agent and hence defendants' Sixth Amendment right to counsel was violated.\n\nBeginning in October 1984, Laurancia was housed in a protective custody cell in the Kern County jail with a number of women charged with child molestation. Laurancia was housed in protective custody because she had previously informed in a murder case; she was not charged with child molestation. Grace, Colleen, and Tutti were housed in the same cell. Laurancia was released from custody on about December 18, 1984, but was again housed with them on various occasions during February, March, April, and May 1985.\n\nDuring the end of October or beginning of November, Laurancia overheard an argument between Tutti and Colleen. Tutti told Colleen that if it had not been for Colleen's \"stupid old man,\" meaning Forsythe, they would not be there. Colleen said Rick was just as guilty. Colleen told Tutti that if Rick had not been threatening the kids, none of this would have happened. Tutti said that it was not like Forsythe never threatened the kids, too. After that, Colleen and Tutti did not talk to each other for a few days. Apparently during this same conversation, Colleen told Tutti that Rick was going to kill the kids if they said anything. They mentioned that the kids were both boys\n\nand girls. On another occasion, Tutti said that if it was not for Wayne, they would not be there. Colleen answered that it was Rick's fault for leaving the state. Colleen said something about Tutti and the kids going with Rick.\n\nAt one point, Grace told Colleen that they -- the authorities -- did not have any evidence because when they got to the house, all they took was an old camera. Grace said they did not have any evidence because they had gotten rid of everything already. She said that the camera that was seized was not good because it did not take good pictures. Colleen said nothing in reply. Tutti was present at the time, although she may have been asleep.\n\nAt trial, Colleen used her diaries to refresh her memory as to her activities and whereabouts during the time in question. Laurancia heard Colleen say there was nothing in the diary that could say she was molesting the kids, because she was not stupid enough to do that. This testimony was admitted only against Colleen.\n\nAnother time, Laurancia walked into the cell and heard Grace tell Colleen that Forsythe had a small dick. Colleen started laughing and said it was just right for her. It is unclear whether this testimony was admitted, as the following colloquy occurred:\n\n\"Mr. Rubin: I'm Going to Move to Strike as Being Hearsay. It's Not Inconsistent With Anything That Was Said Here. I Don't Remember Any Questions --\n\n\"Mr. Gindes: If Grace Dill Wasn't Observing These Things at the Green House, How Would She Know the Size of Wayne Forsythe's Penis?\n\n\"The Court: Well, There Have Been Photographs Here.\n\n\"Mr. Rubin: That Is True. There Have Been Photographs Here.\n\n\"The Court: Objection Sustained.\n\n\"By Mr. Gindes:\n\n\"Q How Long Ago Did This Conversation Take Place?\n\n\"Mr. Sims: Move to Strike. You Sustained the Objection.\n\n\"By Mr. Gindes:\n\n\"Q How Long Ago Did This Talk About the Photographs Take Place? How Long Ago, About, Did This Talk About the Size of Wayne Forsythe's Penis Take Place? When Did This Talk Happen?\n\n\"A It's Been Quite a Few Months Back. In February.\n\n\"Mr. Gindes: I Think That Pretty Much Preceeds [ sic ] When the Photographs Were Shown.\n\n\"Mr. Fusilier: I Didn't Get That. Was It the 7th of February?\n\n\" The Court: Sometime in February. It Doesn't Make Any Difference Anyway.\"\n\nAt some point, Laurancia heard Grace talking about Linda Moten in an unfriendly fashion. (Linda Moten was a former cellmate who testified against defendants at trial.) Laurancia's testimony on this point was admitted only against Grace. Grace and \"everyone\" were calling Moten names because she testified against them. At this time, Grace approached Laurancia and said that if Laurancia could have her bail lowered, they could have it arranged where they could get Laurancia out and they would buy her clothes if she would come to court and be a witness on their behalf. Grace said Laurancia could say she had been there during certain times and had never heard them talk about their case in front of anybody. Grace said she would try to have someone bail Laurancia out of jail.\n\nThe following testimony of Laurancia was admitted against Colleen only. Referring to her children, Colleen would always say, \"Them little bitches,\" and call them whores. Colleen referred to her children as bitches quite a few times; Laurancia never heard her say anything good about them. Grace would tell Colleen to be quiet. Colleen also talked about her tattoos. She showed Laurancia one by her private parts and said she had tried to burn it off.\n\nDeputy Patricia McCatheron testified outside the jury's presence on a motion to dismiss or, alternatively, to strike Laurancia's testimony. From October through December 1984, Deputy McCatheron worked on C deck of the Kern County jail. During that time, she came into contact with Laurancia. McCatheron knew Laurancia had testified in a murder trial some five years earlier and that she had given information to narcotics officers on a couple of occasions. The two women were on friendly terms\n\nand talked from time to time outside the cell. McCatheron considered Laurancia as being \"kind of like an informant.\"\n\nAt some point, Laurancia told McCatheron she was not happy being celled in the molestation tank, because she was not accused of being a molester and it bothered her when the other inmates talked about their cases. (According to Laurancia, McCatheron came up and asked if she had heard anything.) McCatheron asked if a person in the cell named Teresa Cox had mentioned anything about her case, and Laurancia answered that she had heard Teresa talking to her husband or somebody down below about it. The inmates apparently had an ingenious method of communicating among the different levels of the jail by using the toilets. McCatheron asked if Cox mentioned anything about her child, who McCatheron knew was missing. Authorities were trying to find him because he was supposed to have been a victim of child molestation. Laurancia said no; McCatheron told her to go back to the cell and just keep her ears open. Laurancia said okay and asked if she should ask the inmates questions. McCatheron told her not to, just to keep her ears open and let McCatheron know if anything was said about the child. McCatheron told Laurancia there were some pretty heavy molestation cases in the cell. McCatheron did not indicate to Laurancia that the police would do anything for her if she got the information. Laurancia initially spoke with McCatheron before the argument between Tutti and Colleen and before Grace talked to her about the case.\n\nAfter Laurancia agreed to keep her ears open, McCatheron did not make any attempt to have her celled elsewhere. It was McCatheron's belief that the people in the cell would talk about their cases. McCatheron did not offer Laurancia money for information or deals on any charges. McCatheron was concerned for the Cox baby's safety and simply told Laurancia to keep her ears open for information regarding him. She did not ask Laurancia to spy on any of the defendants housed in that cell, nor did she ask Laurancia to get information from anyone specifically. All she asked was that Laurancia let her know if she heard anything about the baby. She did not mention the \"heavy molestation defendants\" in order to convey the message that she was interested in information about them.\n\nLaurancia was removed from the cell in question on June 2, 1985, and placed in a single cell. Only at that time did she contact law enforcement with information regarding the instant case. On June 7, she wrote a letter which was delivered to one of the investigators. On June 12, she accepted a deal whereby she would plead guilty to one charge in return for dismissal of charges involving failure to appear and violation of probation for possession of controlled substances. Part of the agreement was that she would receive\n\nno more than two years in prison, as opposed to the maximum term of three years. There was no agreement that she would testify in any other case.\n\nAs of the date of her testimony in the instant case, Laurancia was in custody awaiting sentencing following her guilty plea to grand theft of a firearm. She was also on probation on the narcotics charge, summary probation having been reinstated at the time she entered her guilty plea. She was due to be sentenced the following week. She had not been promised, nor did she expect, help with her case or leniency in return for her testimony. She contacted the district attorney's office and offered to testify \"for the kids.\"\n\nWe conclude that the appellants have not shown a violation of their Sixth Amendment rights.\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e51\u003c/span\u003e\n\nIn Massiah v. United States (1964) 377 U.S. 201 [12 L.Ed.2d 246, 84 S.Ct. 1199], Massiah and one Colson were charged with narcotics offenses and released on bail. Massiah had retained counsel. Unbeknown to him, Colson decided to cooperate with the authorities. Colson conducted a conversation with Massiah which was monitored by federal agents; Massiah's incriminating statements were introduced against him at trial.\n\nIn reversing the conviction, the United States Supreme Court held that an accused's Sixth Amendment right to counsel is violated by the use of incriminating statements, deliberately elicited by federal agents after indictment and in absence of counsel. (Massiah v. United States, supra, 377 U.S. at p. 206 [12 L.Ed.2d at p. 250].)\n\nIn United States v. Henry (1980) 447 U.S. 264 [65 L.Ed.2d 115, 100 S.Ct. 2183], Henry was arrested and indicted for robbery. After his incarceration, a federal agent working on the case contacted inmate Nichols, who had been a paid informant for some time. The agent told Nichols to be alert to any statements made by federal prisoners, but not to initiate conversations with or question Henry regarding the robbery. After Nichols was released\n\nfrom jail, the agent recontacted him and Nichols reported incriminating statements made by Henry. Nichols was paid for the information.\n\nThe Supreme Court rejected the government's argument that Henry's statements were voluntary and not the result of affirmative conduct on the agent's part to elicit evidence. It noted that the Massiah holding rests squarely on interference with an accused's right to counsel, and that the question before it was whether a government agent deliberately elicited statements from the defendant within the meaning of Massiah. (United States v. Henry, supra, 447 U.S. at p. 270 [65 L.Ed.2d at p. 122].)Three factors were important: (1) Nichols was acting under instructions as a paid informant; (2) Nichols ostensibly was nothing more than Henry's fellow inmate; and (3) Henry was in custody and under indictment at the time he was engaged in conversation by Nichols. (Ibid.)\n\nThe court found that Nichols used his position to secure incriminating information from Henry when counsel was not present. Moreover, his conduct was attributable to the government: he was a paid informant; the agent was aware he had access to Henry and could engage him in conversation; and Nichols was paid only if he produced useful information. \"Even if the agent's statement that he did not intend that Nichols would take affirmative steps to secure incriminating information is accepted, he must have known that such propinquity likely would lead to that result.\" (United States v. Henry, supra, 447 U.S. at p. 271[65 L.Ed.2d at p. 122].) Additionally, in discussions with Nichols, the agent singled Henry out as the inmate in whom he had a special interest. He only instructed Nichols not to question Henry or initiate conversations regarding the robbery; Nichols remained free, under these instructions, \"to discharge his task of eliciting the statements in myriad less direct ways.\" (Id. at p. 271, fn. 8 [65 L.Ed.2d at p. 122].) Finally, according to Nichols's own testimony, he was not merely a passive listener. (Id. at p. 271 [65 L.Ed.2d at pp. 122-123].) \"By intentionally creating a situation likely to induce Henry to make incriminating statements without the assistance of counsel, the Government violated Henry's Sixth Amendment right to counsel.\" (Id. at p. 274 [65 L.Ed.2d at p. 125], fn. omitted.)\n\nHenry did not determine whether the Sixth Amendment is violated where an informant is placed in close proximity to an accused, but makes no effort to stimulate conversations about the crime charged. (United States v. Henry, supra, 447 U.S. at p. 271, fn. 9 [65 L.Ed.2d at p. 123].) This question was answered in Kuhlmann v. Wilson (1986) 477 U.S. 436 [91 L.Ed.2d 364, 106 S.Ct. 2616], wherein no Sixth Amendment violation was found.\n\nKuhlmann was arrested on charges of robbery and murder. Lee, who had agreed to listen to Kuhlmann's conversations and report his remarks to a\n\nfederal agent, was placed in the cell with him. Lee, who was so housed in order to determine the identities of Kuhlmann's confederates, was instructed not to ask questions, but to \"keep his ears open\" for the names of other perpetrators. Kuhlmann initiated conversations with Lee in which he made incriminating statements. The trial court held a hearing, following which it expressly found that Lee followed instructions and only listened, and that Kuhlmann's statements were spontaneous and unsolicited. (Kuhlmann v. Wilson, supra, 477 U.S. at pp. 438-440 [91 L.Ed.2d at pp. 371-372].)\n\nThe Supreme Court held that the Sixth Amendment does not forbid admission of an accused's statements made to an informant placed in close proximity but who makes no effort to stimulate conversations regarding the crime charged. (Kuhlmann v. Wilson, supra, 477 U.S. at p. 456 [91 L.Ed.2d at pp. 382-383].) It distinguished Henry on the ground that, in that case, although the informant did not question defendant, he stimulated conversations in order to elicit incriminating information. (Kuhlmann, supra, at p. 458 [91 L.Ed.2d at p. 384].) It also distinguished Maine v. Moulton (1985) 474 U.S. 159 [88 L.Ed.2d 481, 106 S.Ct. 477], in which the defendant's accomplice agreed to cooperate with authorities and to wear a listening device. In Moulton, because of the relationship between the defendant and the informant, the informant's engaging the defendant in active conversation about their upcoming trial was certain to elicit incriminating statements. Accordingly, the informant's participation was the functional equivalent of interrogation. (Kuhlmann, supra, at pp. 458-459 [91 L.Ed.2d at pp. 383-384].) The Kuhlmann court concluded: \"[T]he primary concern of the Massiah line of decisions is secret interrogation by investigatory techniques that are the equivalent of direct police interrogation. Since 'the Sixth Amendment is not violated whenever -- by luck or happenstance -- the State obtains incriminating statements from the accused after the right to counsel has attached,' [citations], a defendant does not make out a violation of that right simply by showing that an informant, either through prior arrangement or voluntarily, reported his incriminating statements to the police. Rather, the defendant must demonstrate that the police and their informant took some action, beyond merely listening, that was designed deliberately to elicit incriminating remarks.\" (Id. at p. 459 [91 L.Ed.2d at p. 384].) Chief Justice Burger, the author of Henry, concurred: \"There is a vast difference between placing an 'ear' in the suspect's cell and placing a voice in the cell to encourage conversation for the 'ear' to record.\" (Id. at p. 461 [91 L.Ed.2d at p. 386] [conc. opn. of Burger, C. J.].)\n\nRecent California cases are in accord. In People v. Whitt (1984) 36 Cal. 3d 724 [205 Cal. Rptr. 810, 685 P.2d 1161], an agent asked deLoach, whom he was transporting to California on an extradition warrant, to contact him if he heard anything regarding any homicides. The agent was unaware that\n\ndeLoach had previously been a paid informant. Whitt was housed with deLoach, based on available space in the jail. The two had known each other previously, and Whitt talked about the case. DeLoach reported the conversations to the agent, who told him not to solicit any more information, but that it was okay if he heard more. DeLoach subsequently made further reports, after which agents contacted the district attorney on his behalf. DeLoach never received any promises of leniency and testified at a suppression hearing that Whitt volunteered all statements. (Id. at pp. 737-739.)\n\nAlthough the California Supreme Court found this a close case, it held that the record supported the conclusion the state did not deliberately elicit Whitt's statements to deLoach. (People v. Whitt, supra, 36 Cal. 3d at p. 740.) In so doing, it focused on the state's conduct as a whole, rather than that of the informant. (Id. at p. 741.)\n\n\"In sum, the critical inquiry is whether the state has created a situation likely to provide it with incriminating statements from an accused. If it has, it may not disclaim responsibility for this information by the simple device of telling an informant to 'listen but don't ask.'\" (People v. Whitt, supra, 36 Cal. 3d at p. 742.) The court found it irrelevant to a Henry analysis that the informant followed instructions regarding not asking questions and that Whitt's statements were voluntary. (Ibid.) It noted that if the police had prior arrangements with deLoach of this sort, their acceptance of the information and agreement to speak to the district attorney might be enough to attribute his activities, after their first meeting with him, to the state. \"Under those circumstances, the inference that deLoach expected a quid pro quo and that the police encouraged this expectation would be compelling.\" (Id. at p. 744.) Absent a prior relationship, however, their acceptance of information and agreement to speak to the prosecutor was not enough to establish a Sixth Amendment violation. There was no indication more information would help influence the prosecutor, and the police gave no incentive to obtain information to such an extent that deLoach's conduct was attributable to the state. (Ibid.)\n\nIn People v. Hovey (1988) 44 Cal. 3d 543[244 Cal. Rptr. 121, 749 P.2d 776] (cert. den.488 U.S. 871 [102 L.Ed.2d 157, 109 S.Ct. 188]), Hovey was the prime suspect in a murder case, although he had not been charged with that crime. Hovey was incarcerated and represented by counsel on charges unrelated to the murder. After his arrest, he invoked his right to remain silent. An officer met with Lee, his cellmate. The officer hoped Lee would pass on information but did not instruct him to do so. The officer told Lee he could not direct him to attempt to obtain information, but that if anything important came up, Lee should decide whether or not to report it. Lee\n\nwas promised no reward or consideration, although Lee knew informants frequently received protection from assaults by other inmates. Lee informed the officer of statements made by Hovey, and later testified his sole motivation for doing so was \"to relieve my mind [of] what I heard.\" (Id. at pp. 557-558.)\n\nIn affirming Hovey's conviction, the California Supreme Court found that although Lee was asked to listen and report, he was not directed to initiate conversations. Merely being asked to listen and report did not make him a police agent whose activities violated Hovey's right to counsel and privilege against self-incrimination. (People v. Hovey, supra, 44 Cal. 3d at p. 559.) Unlike Lee, the informant in Henry was not a mere passive listener or listening post. ( Hovey, supra, at p. 559.) Moreover, Lee obtained information regarding an offense for which Hovey had not been charged. Massiah and Henry apply only to attempts to gather information regarding formal charges, since a defendant has a present right to counsel only as to those charges. Under Kuhlmann, in any event, Hovey's volunteered statements were admissible because Lee asked no questions. The statements were not deliberately elicited by a police agent. (Hovey, supra, at p. 561; see People v. Williams (1988) 44 Cal. 3d 1127, 1141 [245 Cal. Rptr. 635, 751 P.2d 901], cert. den. 488 U.S. 975 [102 L.Ed.2d 549, 109 S.Ct. 514] [\"[A] general policy of encouraging inmates to provide useful information does not transform them into government agents; some specific action 'designed deliberately to elicit incriminating remarks' is required.\" A mere governmental \"listening post\" does not violate the Sixth Amendment under Kuhlmann ].)\n\nIn the instant case, McCatheron knew that Laurancia had provided information in the past, but not on this type of case. (See People v. Dominick (1986) 182 Cal. App. 3d 1174 [227 Cal. Rptr. 849].)\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e52\u003c/span\u003e As far as the evidence showed, Laurancia was housed with defendants according to normal housing procedures. Significantly, McCatheron only directed Laurancia to \"keep her ears open\" regarding a case that had nothing to do with defendants. (See People v. Talamantez (1985) 169 Cal. App. 3d 443 [215 Cal. Rptr.\n\n542].)\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e53\u003c/span\u003e Also of significance is the fact that Laurancia did not question defendants but merely overheard them talking. In fact, it does not appear she was even part of the incriminating conversations, except insofar as Grace allegedly solicited her as a witness. In ruling Laurancia's testimony to be admissible, the trial court impliedly found that Laurancia was not promised anything in return for her testimony, nor did she expect anyone to ask for leniency in terms of her sentence. Her stated motivation for testifying was her concern about children. Although the truth of her testimony regarding her motives and expectations might be subject to question, the record simply does not show that she deliberately elicited incriminating remarks from defendants, or that the state created a situation likely to provide it with incriminating statements from these defendants. Accordingly, defendants' constitutional rights were not violated by admission of Laurancia's testimony.\n\nB. Adoptive Admissions\n\nColleen contends the trial court erred by admitting into evidence, as adoptive admissions, several postarrest jail conversations. The first occurred on June 16, 1984, when Grace visited Colleen in jail; it was admitted only against Grace and Colleen. The transcript of the relevant portion of the tape-recorded conversation reads:\n\n\"Colleen: He could if we get our shit together and quit fightin' all the time.\n\n\"Grace: And Allen [B.] is something else.\n\n\"Colleen: Why?\n\n\"Grace: He is just trying to cause trouble.\n\n\"Colleen: For . . . about what?\n\n\"Grace: Telling everybody well there's pictures here and there's pictures there. He's seen 'em. He is really trying to make trouble, Hon, I left word all around. I says, 'Tell him he better keep his mouth shut before he's up there with them. But you know . . . .\n\n\"Colleen: I wonder why he's trying to start shit like that. He knows better than that.\n\n\"Grace: I know he does, just looking for attention, I think is what it is.\n\n\"Colleen: Well, you better tell him that uh --\n\n\"Grace: I --\n\n\"Colleen: He was living with me when all this shit was suppossed [ sic ] to have taken place. If he don't want his ass drug right up here with us he better shut his goddamn mouth. Cause I'll tell 'em who in the fuck I was living with.\"\n\nThe next conversation, which was admitted only against Forsythe and Colleen, occurred June 25, 1984, when Forsythe visited Colleen in jail. (Colleen states she has no objection to this evidence, since her statements are not adoptive admissions or incriminating.) The transcript of the relevant portion of the tape reads:\n\n\"Colleen: Hi.\n\n\"Wayne Forsythe: Hello[.]\n\n\"Colleen: I never thought I'd see this day.\n\n\"Wayne Forsythe: Oh really. I told you I'd be here.\n\n\"Colleen: I never thought I'd see the day that we'd be sitting like this though. If anything, I figured you on this side and me on that side.\"\n\nColleen also challenges admission of another segment of the same conversation, again admitted only against Forsythe and herself. The transcript of the relevant portion of the tape reads:\n\n\"Colleen: . . . stay, stay out here till they release me cause they're [--] Pray they gotta drop these charges.\n\n\"Wayne Forsythe: They will[.]\n\n\"Colleen: The fifth. My lawyer said it might go to jury trial though.\n\n\"Wayne Forsythe: It might but, they don't have enough evidence to carry it to a jury trial. Cause if they had enough evidence they'd have me too. They'd have everybidy [ sic ]. They arrested three people and that was it. I --\n\n\"Colleen: Well at first there wasn't, the only thing they had on me is just uh -- they said I was just there.\"\n\nFinally, Colleen challenges admission of Laurancia's testimony that Grace told Colleen there was no evidence because they had gotten rid of everything, to which Colleen did not respond. Since these conversations all occurred after Colleen's arrest and administration of Miranda (Miranda v. Arizona (1966) 384 U.S. 436 [16 L.Ed.2d 694, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 10 A.L.R.3d 974]) warnings, the argument runs, use of her silence violated her privilege against self-incrimination.\n\nEvidence Code section 1221 provides: \"Evidence of a statement offered against a party is not made inadmissible by the hearsay rule if the statement is one of which the party, with knowledge of the content thereof, has by words or other conduct manifested his adoption or his belief in its truth.\" As stated in People v. Preston (1973) 9 Cal. 3d 308, 313-314 [107 Cal. Rptr. 300, 508 P.2d 300]: \"If a person is accused of having committed a crime, under circumstances which fairly afford him an opportunity to hear, understand, and to reply, and which do not lend themselves to an inference that he was relying on the right of silence guaranteed by the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution, and he fails to speak, or he makes an evasive or equivocal reply, both the accusatory statement and the fact of silence or equivocation may be offered as an implied or adoptive admission of guilt. [Citations.]\" And as further explained recently in People v. Edelbacher (1989) 47 Cal. 3d 983 at page 1011 [254 Cal. Rptr. 586, 766 P.2d 1]: \"To warrant admissibility [under Evid. Code, § 1221], it is sufficient that the evidence supports a reasonable inference that an accusatory statement was made under circumstances affording a fair opportunity to deny the accusation; whether defendant's conduct actually constituted an adoptive admission becomes a question for the jury to decide. [Citation.]\"\n\nIn the case at bench, the challenged evidence was admissible under the above authorities. The circumstances do not lend themselves to an inference Colleen was relying on her Fifth Amendment privilege of silence in not responding to the accusatory statements. These were jailhouse\n\nconversations, occurring between fellow inmates or inmate and visitors; they were ostensibly private -- members of law enforcement were not immediately present and visibly listening to the conversations; they were not immediately preceded by Miranda warnings; they did not occur in an inherently accusatory or interrogative setting; and the record reveals no indication Colleen or anyone else involved suspected they were being tape-recorded or that Laurancia would inform on them.\n\nHere, the jurors were instructed in the language of CALJIC No. 2.71.5 (4th ed. 1979 bound vol.) (adoptive admission -- silence, false or evasive reply to accusation). They could reasonably have concluded the challenged testimony constituted adoptive admissions.\n\nColleen contends, however, that Doyle v. Ohio (1976) 426 U.S. 610 [49 L.Ed.2d 91, 96 S.Ct. 2240] and its progeny place a blanket prohibition on the use of postarrest silence.\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e54\u003c/span\u003e In Doyle, the use for impeachment purposes of a defendant's silence, at the time of arrest and after receiving Miranda warnings, was held to violate due process. (Doyle, supra, at p. 619 [49 L.Ed.2d at p. 98].) The United States Supreme Court observed: \"Silence in the wake of these warnings may be nothing more than the arrestee's exercise of these Miranda rights. Thus, every post-arrest silence is insolubly ambiguous because of what the State is required to advise the person arrested.\" (Id. at p. 617 [49 L.Ed.2d at p. 97], fn. omitted.)\n\nIn United States v. Hale (1975) 422 U.S. 171 [45 L.Ed.2d 99, 95 S.Ct. 2133], the Supreme Court found an accused's silence during police interrogation lacked significant probative value, since an arrestee is under no duty to speak and refute an accusation. (Id. at pp. 176, 180 [45 L.Ed.2d at pp. 104-105, 106-107].)\n\n\"At the time of arrest and during custodial interrogation, innocent and guilty alike -- perhaps particularly the innocent -- may find the situation so intimidating that they may choose to stand mute. A variety of reasons may influence that decision . . . [T]he inherent pressures of in-custody interrogation . . . compound the difficulty of identifying the reason for silence.\" (Id. at p. 177 [45 L.Ed.2d at p. 105], fn. omitted.)\n\nIn People v. Free (1982) 131 Cal. App. 3d 155 [182 Cal. Rptr. 259], this court dealt with a situation in which defendant testified at trial that he killed the victim in self-defense. The prosecution then cross-examined him about his flight after the shooting and his failure to contact the authorities. In determining the cross-examination was proper, we noted that the basis of\n\nDoyle was the fundamental unfairness of giving an accused Miranda warnings, then commenting on his exercise of the right to remain silent. \"By informing [the accused] of his right against self-incrimination, there is an implicit assurance that a decision to remain silent cannot be used against the accused.\" (People v. Free, supra, at p. 162.) From an examination of various state and federal cases, we distilled the California rule: \"[P]ostarrest silence may not be commented upon if it follows a Miranda warning. The same rule may apply if there is no Miranda warning in order to foreclose inducement of police to dispense with a Miranda advisement . . . . Prearrest silence may be commented upon unless the court finds the silence was an invocation of Fifth Amendment rights. Prearrest silence in circumstances in which there is no inference of a reliance on the right to silence may be used to impeach by way of cross-examination.\" (Id. at p. 165.)\n\nTaken by itself, broad language in the foregoing cases supports Colleen's assertion. However, the factual context cannot be ignored. In both Doyle and Hale, the defendant was cross-examined regarding his silence, following the receipt of Miranda warnings, at the time of his arrest. Similarly, the cases examined in Free concern either silence at the time of arrest, or prior to arrest but in the face of an accusation made by a police officer. Likewise, People v. Cockrell (1965) 63 Cal. 2d 659, 669-670 [47 Cal. Rptr. 788, 408 P.2d 116] (cert. den. 389 U.S. 1006 [19 L.Ed.2d 604, 88 S.Ct. 568]), which prohibited drawing an adverse inference from defendant's silence although defendant made no statement indicating he was invoking his privilege against self-incrimination, concerned a situation in which a coconspirator made an accusatory statement in defendant's presence at the police station. Similarly, People v. Gaines (1980) 103 Cal. App. 3d 89[162 Cal. Rptr. 827], disapproved on other grounds in People v. Nelums (1982) 31 Cal. 3d 355, 360 [182 Cal. Rptr. 515, 644 P.2d 201], found constitutional error where the prosecutor cross-examined defendant about his silence upon arrest. Although it was assumed Miranda warnings had not yet been given, the improper questioning concerned whether defendant told his story to the arresting officers. (People v. Gaines, supra, at pp. 91-92.) Under those circumstances, the court found no authority that the evidentiary use of postarrest silent was constitutionally permissible, nor could it say the circumstances did not lend themselves to an inference that defendant was relying on his Fifth Amendment right of silence. (Id. at p. 96.)\n\nA criminal defendant's silence in the face of a police officer's accusation is distinguishable from such silence in the face of a nonpolice officer's hearsay accusation. The former is more reasonably due to exercise of the privilege against self-incrimination than belief in the truth of the accusation. (People v. Pic'l (1981) 114 Cal. App. 3d 824, 859, fn. 8 [171 Cal. Rptr. 106]; reversed on other grounds in People v. Pic'l (1982) 31 Cal. 3d 731 [183 Cal. Rptr. 685,\n\n646 P.2d 847]; disapproved on other grounds in People v. Kimble (1988) 44 Cal. 3d 480, 498[244 Cal. Rptr. 148, 749 P.2d 803].) Thus, \"'[a] typical example of an adoptive admission is the accusatory statement to a criminal defendant made by a person other than a police officer, and defendant's conduct of silence, or his words or equivocal and evasive replies in response. With knowledge of the accusation, the defendant's conduct of silence or his words in the nature of evasive or equivocal replies lead reasonably to the inference that he believes the accusatory statement to be true.' [Citation.]\" (People v. Silva (1988) 45 Cal. 3d 604, 623-624 [247 Cal. Rptr. 573, 754 P.2d 1070], cert. den. 488 U.S. 1019 [102 L.Ed.2d 809, 109 S.Ct. 820].)\n\nAccordingly, we conclude that neither Doyle nor the other cases relied upon by Colleen constitute authority for excluding adoptive admissions under the circumstances present here.\n\nC. Aranda\n\nDefendants contend certain testimony should have been ruled inadmissible, or severance motions granted, pursuant to People v. Aranda (1965) 63 Cal. 2d 518 [47 Cal. Rptr. 353, 407 P.2d 265]. For the most part, their claims center around the testimony of Linda Moten, although they also challenge admission of certain jail conversations and part of Laurancia's testimony. Respondent addresses the issue only in passing.\n\nLinda Moten was arrested on January 14, 1985, and charged with various sex offenses.\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e55\u003c/span\u003e She was placed in protective custody, where two or three days later she came into contact with Colleen. Moten testified she heard Colleen say she would do anything to get out of jail and would lie or have anybody lie for her. Colleen admitted selling cocaine and marijuana in front of her kids. She further stated it was her business what \"they\" did to her kids, not the police's. Colleen said she had some evidence she had to get rid of before the cops or anybody could get hold of it. Colleen said it was pictures, which she had to burn. She threatened to kill Moten if Moten ever told anybody what she said. Colleen also threatened another lady who had some charges pending and was set to testify against defendants. According to Moten, \"They said they would kill her and they would have to get rid of her.\"\n\nMoten testified that Colleen also talked about putting cocaine in the little girls' vaginas and on the little boys' penises. This was done to her sister's kids, \"then they sucked it off.\" Colleen said she did it \"when they had sex acts.\" She said when she had sex acts with her children, \"they\" took pictures\n\nand sold them to a guy in Los Angeles for drugs and stuff. The pictures were of children and sex acts and orgies. Colleen was saying this to Teresa Cox.\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e56\u003c/span\u003e\n\nOutside the jury's presence, prior to Moten's testimony, Vendrasco announced the evidence was only relevant to Colleen.\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e57\u003c/span\u003e The following colloquy occurred:\n\n\"Mr. Lorenz: I'm Going to Move That the Court Give Some Special Admonition That This Evidence Is Only Introduced Against Colleen Bennett. And I Also Gather the Witness Is Not Going to Be Testifying That Colleen Bennett Told Me That She Conspired With Rick and Tutti and X Number of Other Defendants.\n\n\"The Court: Is That Correct, Mr. Vendrasco?\n\n\"Mr. Vendrasco: That Is Correct. I'm Not Going to Elicit Any Aranda Type Statements Where She Is Saying What Another Person Said, That She and Somebody Else Did.\"\n\nRubin contended that the evidence would be highly prejudicial to Rick, while not being probative. He also argued that an admonition would be insufficient. Accordingly, he moved for severance. All defense counsel joined except Eyherabide. The motion was denied.\n\nLaurancia's testimony is set forth, ante. Prior to calling her in rebuttal, Gindes requested and was granted permission to recall Tutti for further cross-examination regarding admissions allegedly made by her to, or in the presence of, Laurancia. He asserted that by having the declarant defendants testify and deny making the alleged admissions, the other defendants could cross-examine and thus no Aranda error would occur. Accordingly, no rights would be violated by admission of Laurancia's testimony against all defendants.\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e58\u003c/span\u003e Rubin argued this procedure would not cure Aranda problems. Subsequently, during Laurancia's testimony, Gindes argued that to limit her testimony to any defendant(s) would violate Aranda since limiting\n\ninstructions would be insufficient. Everything should be admitted against everyone, he contended, under the exception to the hearsay rule for prior inconsistent statements. The trial court first sustained defense hearsay objections, then reversed its ruling and admitted Laurancia's testimony against everyone. Rubin's motion for severance, which was joined by all defense counsel, was denied.\n\nIn People v. Aranda, supra, 63 Cal. 2d 518, codefendant Martinez confessed, implicating Aranda in a robbery. Martinez testified and denied making the confession. The jury was instructed it could only consider Martinez's confession against Martinez. (Id. at pp. 522-524.) In reversing Aranda's conviction, the California Supreme Court adopted rules that are not constitutionally compelled but which are \"judicially declared rules of practice to implement section 1098.\" (Id. at p. 530, fn. omitted.) It stated: \"When the prosecution proposes to introduce into evidence an extrajudicial statement of one defendant that implicates a codefendant, the trial court must adopt one of the following procedures: (1) It can permit a joint trial if all parts of the extrajudicial statements implicating any codefendants can be and are effectively deleted without prejudice to the declarant. By effective deletions, we mean not only direct and indirect identifications of codefendants but any statements that could be employed against nondeclarant codefendants once their identity is otherwise established. (2) It can grant a severance of trials if the prosecution insists that it must use the extrajudicial statements and it appears that effective deletions cannot be made. (3) If the prosecution has successfully resisted a motion for severance and thereafter offers an extrajudicial statement implicating a codefendant, the trial court must exclude it if effective deletions are not possible.\" (Id. at pp. 530-531, fn. omitted.)\n\nIn Bruton v. United States (1968) 391 U.S. 123 [20 L.Ed.2d 476, 88 S.Ct. 1620], a witness testified to codefendant Evans's confession that he and defendant committed a robbery. Evans did not testify. The jury was instructed it could only consider the confession against Evans. Because of the substantial risk the jury, despite instructions, considered Evans's confession against defendant, the Supreme Court held that admission of said confession at a joint trial violated defendant's Sixth Amendment right of cross-examination. (Id. at p. 126[20 L.Ed.2d at p. 479].) The introduction of Evans's confession added substantial weight to the government's case in a form not subject to cross-examination, since Evans did not take the stand. Therefore, defendant was denied his right of confrontation. (Id. at pp. 127-128 [20 L.Ed.2d at pp. 480-481].)\n\nIn Nelson v. O'Neil (1971) 402 U.S. 622[29 L.Ed.2d 222, 91 S.Ct. 1723], a case arising out of California, defendant and codefendant Runnels offered\n\nthe same alibi defense at their joint trial. A police officer testified that Runnels confessed and implicated defendant. Runnels took the stand and denied making the statement or that it was true. The trial court instructed the jury it could only consider the confession against Runnels.\n\nIn holding there was no constitutional violation, the Supreme Court noted that Runnels's confession was properly found to be hearsay as to defendant and hence inadmissible under California evidentiary law. (Nelson v. O'Neil, supra, 402 U.S. at p. 626 [29 L.Ed.2d at pp. 226-227].) It determined that under Bruton, a cautionary instruction provides inadequate protection for a defendant where the declarant codefendant does not take the stand, because through the confession, the codefendant becomes a witness against defendant. Defendant must constitutionally have the opportunity to confront such a witness, which he or she cannot do if the codefendant refuses to take the stand. (Nelson, supra, at p. 626 [29 L.Ed.2d at p. 626].)\n\nHowever, where the declarant is present to testify and submit to cross-examination, no confrontation problem exists, despite defendant's absence at the time the codefendant allegedly made the out-of-court statement. (Nelson v. O'Neil, supra, 402 U.S. at pp. 626-627 [29 L.Ed.2d at pp. 226-227].) \"The Constitution as construed in Bruton, in other words, is violated only where the out-of-court hearsay statement is that of a declarant who is unavailable at the trial for 'full and effective' cross-examination.\" (Id. at p. 627 [29 L.Ed.2d at p. 227.) A witness can be cross-examined regarding a statement not affirmed by him. (Ibid.) \"[W]here a codefendant takes the stand in his own defense, denies making an alleged out-of-court statement implicating the defendant, and proceeds to testify favorably to the defendant concerning the underlying facts, the defendant has been denied no rights protected by the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments.\" (Id. at pp. 629-630 [29 L.Ed.2d at p. 228].)\n\nIn People v. Brown (1978) 79 Cal. App. 3d 649 [145 Cal. Rptr. 130], the court recognized that some Aranda error is based on constitutional principles, while other is not. It stated: \"The People urge that no Aranda error is involved in the case at bench since codefendant Rollins became a witness and testified, thus precluding defendant Brown from urging any violation of constitutional due-process or witness-confrontation rights. This view lacks merit as Aranda specifically sets forth that the principles adopted 'are to be regarded, not as constitutionally compelled, but as judicially declared rules of practice to implement [Pen. Code] section 1098.' [Citation.]\n\n\". . .\n\n\"Although, by taking the stand, Rollins precluded the Aranda error from constituting a denial to defendant Brown of any constitutional rights protected by the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution, his action did not eliminate the error. Rollins' taking the stand simply changed the standard for determining whether the Aranda error is reversible or not. (See fn. 59.) In place of the prejudicial-per-se error (Bruton v. United States [ supra ]), the error must be gauged under the standard of whether it is reasonably probable that a result more favorable to defendant would have been reached in the absence of the error. [Citations.]\" (People v. Brown, supra, 79 Cal. App. 3d at pp. 656-657; see also People v. Atkins (1975) 53 Cal. App. 3d 348, 356-357 [125 Cal. Rptr. 855].)\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e59\u003c/span\u003e\n\nIn the case at bench, the trial court did not follow the requirements of Aranda. However, defendants' constitutional rights were not violated by admission of the various statements, since the declarants subjected themselves to cross-examination. In the case of Moten's testimony, moreover, as in Nelson v. O'Neil, supra, 402 U.S. 622, the jury was admonished it could only consider the evidence against Colleen.\n\nIn the event of retrial, defendants will be free to seek severance or the exclusion of certain testimony on Aranda grounds. The People will be at liberty to argue in response that Aranda failed to survive Proposition 8 except to the extent it is constitutionally based. (See People v. Ainsworth (1988) 45 Cal. 3d 984, 1010 [248 Cal. Rptr. 568, 755 P.2d 1017], cert. den. 488 U.S. 1050 [102 L.Ed.2d 1006, 109 S.Ct. 883]; People v. Jacobs (1987) 195 Cal. App. 3d 1636, 1649-1650 [241 Cal. Rptr. 550].)Assuming the trial court determines Aranda does not compel severance or the exclusion of evidence, it should still consider the severance question in light of the factors set forth in People v. Massie (1967) 66 Cal. 2d 899, 916-917 [59 Cal. Rptr. 733, 428 P.2d 869].\n\nA separate but related question remains regarding which defendants Laurancia's testimony was admissible against, aside from Aranda concerns. Gindes relied heavily on Nelson v. O'Neil, supra, 402 U.S. 622 in arguing for admissibility against all defendants. However, O'Neil does not expressly support a blanket policy of admissibility. As noted, in O'Neil the trial court properly gave a limiting instruction and did not admit Runnels's confession against the nondeclarant defendant, it being hearsay as to him.\n\nIn O'Neil, the confession fell within none of the recognized hearsay objections with regard to defendant. In the case at bench, however, Laurancia took the stand and testified after Colleen, Grace, and Tutti had all denied participating in molestations or making various incriminating statements. As to them, Laurancia's testimony was properly admitted as prior inconsistent statements pursuant to Evidence Code section 1235.\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e60\u003c/span\u003e\n\nPursuant to People v. Becerra (1987) 188 Cal. App. 3d 772, 777 [233 Cal. Rptr. 679], Laurancia's testimony was also properly admitted against the nondeclarant defendants. In Becerra, codefendant Gutierrez made a postarrest statement which implicated defendant. Citing Nelson v. O'Neil, supra, 402 U.S. at pages 629-630 [29 L.Ed.2d at p. 228]; People v. Steger (1976) 16 Cal. 3d 539, 551[128 Cal. Rptr. 161, 546 P.2d 665, 83 A.L.R.3d 1206]; and In re Rosoto (1974) 10 Cal. 3d 939, 952 [112 Cal. Rptr. 641, 519 P.2d 1065, 69 A.L.R.3d 980] (cert. den. 419 U.S. 897 [42 L.Ed.2d 141, 95 S.Ct. 177]), the court stated: \"Since Gutierrez testified favorably to Becerra at trial, denied making the incriminating out-of-court statement, and was available for cross-examination, Gutierrez's postarrest statement was fully admissible as a prior inconsistent statement, against Becerra as well as against Gutierrez.\"\n\nWe therefore conclude that Laurancia's testimony was properly admitted against everyone. In People v. Jenkins (1973) 34 Cal. App. 3d 893, 896 [110 Cal. Rptr. 465], convictions were affirmed where Jenkins, Mayer, and Givens were all originally codefendants in a robbery prosecution. Givens was subsequently allowed to plead guilty with the understanding that he would testify against Jenkins and Mayer. Mayer's pretrial severance motion was denied. At trial, Givens denied having knowledge of, or making statements about, the robbery. Law enforcement witnesses were then permitted to testify that Givens told them he, Jenkins, and Mayer had committed the robbery. The jury was instructed it could consider the prior inconsistent statements for the truth of the matter asserted.\n\nJenkins permitted use of prior inconsistent statements against nondeclarants. The same situation exists in the case at bench. Since all defendants got the benefit of the denials made by Grace, Tutti, and Colleen, any out-of-court\n\nstatements made by those three which were inconsistent with their denials should also be considered as to the nondeclarant defendants. Under O'Neil, there is no constitutional bar to the procedure, because the declarant defendants testified and were subject to cross-examination by the nondeclarant defendants.\n\nIV.\n\nAdmission of Dr. Woodling's Testimony\n\nOn March 7, 1985, Dr. Bruce Woodling examined Lisa, then almost eight, and Carol, then twelve. Rick, Colleen, Grace, Dill, Tutti, and Forsythe now contend that the trial court erred by admitting Woodling's testimony, in that use of a colposcope to establish sexual abuse does not meet the Kelly-Frye\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e61\u003c/span\u003e standard of admissibility.\n\nRespondent contends that only Rick and Colleen preserved the Kelly-Frye issue for appeal by making proper objections at trial. (See People v. Stanley (1984) 36 Cal. 3d 253, 260-261 [203 Cal. Rptr. 461, 681 P.2d 302].) However, analysis of the issue as to all defendants promotes judicial economy and precludes a subsequent claim that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to object. For the same reasons we consider the issue as to Grace, even though she did not join therein until her reply brief, and points raised for the first time in an appellant's reply brief generally are not considered on appeal. (People v. Jackson (1981) 121 Cal. App. 3d 862, 873 [176 Cal. Rptr. 166].)\n\nDr. Woodling has examined several hundred children between the ages of five and twelve for sexual abuse who were referred to him by law enforcement agencies, the district attorney's office, or child protective services. He also has a family practice, in which he has examined children with no history of sexual abuse.\n\nTo determine whether a female child has been sexually abused, Dr. Woodling first talks to the child and takes a history. Sometimes he employs anatomically correct dolls. He then does a general wellness assessment. Following this, he looks around the outer and inner lips of the vagina, without penetrating the area, to the hymenal area, and carefully inspects the hymen and the posterior fourchette, the zone of tissue that occurs between the end of the vagina and the beginning of the anus. After completing the evaluation, he observes the area around the anus, and in selected cases he\n\nmakes an internal examination and looks at the rectum. He also uses a magnifying system called a colposcope, which has a five- to thirty-power magnification capability. He uses the system to again check the external aspect of the female genitals as well as the area around the anus, and sometimes takes photos through the colposcope.\n\nColposcopy, the use of a colposcope, is basically a way for a physician to get a magnified view of areas of the child's body. Colposcopy has been used in Europe since the early 1960's and has been regularly used in gynecology in the United States since the mid-1960's. Dr. Woodling used colposcopy in medical school and incorporated it into his family practice in 1975, but only began using it for the evaluation of sexual abuse a little over two years before trial. He did so following a publication in Medical Science Law describing a series of 500 patients who were examined in Brazil and the resulting findings.\n\nColposcopy has been used primarily to study abnormal pap smears and changes that occur in a woman's cervix. Its use in determining whether someone has been sexually traumatized first became accepted in South America and Italy. The technique was developed to observe microtraumas that are not visible to the naked eye. At the time of trial, Dr. Woodling had written an article that would appear in September 1985 in the International Journal of Child Abuse and Neglect, titled Colposcopy as a New Modality for Evaluating Child Sex Abuse.\n\nWhere someone is forcibly sodomized in a single episode, with no lubricants used, and the person is not regularly sodomized, Dr. Woodling would expect a great deal of local trauma, including abrasions, fissures, and swelling. The anal sphincter might spasm, and internally there might be petechiae (tiny bruises) and evulsions (lacerations) of the mucus membrane. In the person not regularly sodomized, when a penis or other object is directed at the anus, the normal response is for the anal sphincter to tighten and create tremendous resistance. This is not a voluntary reaction.\n\nIf a child were sodomized every other weekend over a long period of time, and lubrication were used, the child's normal body responses would change. A series of more than 10 sodomies would lead to an accommodation of the normal reflexive response of tightening the anal sphincter, so that when the entrance of the sphincter is stimulated, the sphincter relaxes sufficiently so that there is an easier introduction of the penis into the anus. Sodomy is thus more easily achieved and there is less trauma, if any. Assuming the use of lubrication and the learning of the relaxation response, the child can then be sodomized without feeling pain or suffering further physical trauma. It is very common in chronic sodomy for a child not to\n\nexperience pain after the adaptive mechanism has been in effect. It would not be unusual for a child not to bleed, because of the use of lubricants and the specific attempt on the part of the person doing the sodomy not to cause injury.\n\nIn 50 to 70 percent of the cases, a rectal examination of a chronically sodomized child will not reveal evidence of any injury one week after the last sodomy. An examination of a child who has been the victim of chronic sodomy may reveal signs of sodomy; however, the absence of such signs does not indicate that the child has not been sodomized. A child examined a year after the last sodomy could still show signs, such as scarring, at the time of the examination. However, if the only injury were a small bruise or local swelling, evidence of that would not be visible a year later. Even scar tissue may diminish with the passage of time if there is no further sodomy.\n\nIn an examination to determine if a child has been chronically sodomized, there are ways to determine if the child has the relaxation reflex, i.e., the ability to relax the anus, upon external stimulation. One is to place a gloved finger on the anus and apply gentle pressure. Another is to stroke the tissue next to the anus with a cotton swab (the wink response). The third is to pull the cheeks of the buttocks apart (the lateral traction test). In each test, if the response is present, there will be a relaxation. If the stimulus, i.e., the sodomy, ceases, the reflex will initially persist unchanged. However, after six to eighteen months, it will no longer be present. Woodling felt that the presence of relaxation reflexes were not 100 percent diagnostic as of the time of trial, because a controlled research study had yet to be done.\n\nIf a child is chronically sodomized over a long period of time, then is put in a safe environment for approximately a year and then examined, a normal anus and no wink response would not be inconsistent with a history of chronic sodomy. Fifty to seventy percent of all cases in which force was not involved would result in no findings. However, sometimes children who are exposed to sodomy at a very early age will receive injuries resulting in scars, even with very gentle sodomy. In such cases, there will be small scars and sometimes areas of hypopigmentation. In some cases, where there has been local bleeding into the tissue, there will initially be a swollen mass, then following healing there will develop a tag of tissue, which is referred to as an external tag and is similar to an external hemorrhoid. Such tags are commonly seen in adults but are very uncommon in children.\n\nThe most frequent location for a tag of tissue and related scar or fissure in a child who has been regularly sodomized will be in the 6 o'clock position with the child prone. Other injuries can occur anywhere about the anus, because until the child learns the relaxation reflex, a substantial amount of\n\nforce is needed for the penis to pass the sphincter muscle. The use of lubricants diminishes the likelihood of injury, and in such cases there may be no findings unless an examination is performed shortly after the sodomy. The other likely point for scarring is the 12 o'clock position. The signs of sodomy are identical for girls and boys.\n\nThe most common form of vaginal abuse of girls involving a penis is vulvar coitus. The penis is put into the vaginal area and usually there is an intercourse-like motion on the part of the male, but the penis merely stays within the lips of the labia and does not go all the way into the vagina. A photograph of an act of vulvar coitus would look exactly like one of penetration into the vagina. Vulvar coitus is usually performed because the size of an erect male penis vis-a-vis that of a child's vaginal opening makes penetration without injury very difficult. In addition, a child does not know how to relax the pubococcygeus muscle, which is the muscle that supports the vagina and urethra. It can require a great deal of force to achieve penetration when a pubococcygeal muscle is contracted, even in an adult female.\n\nIf lubricants are used, vulvar coitus can be achieved without signs of injury. Subtle signs may be found, however, in many cases, especially when lubricants are not used. There are minor visual injuries in the tissue, which leave scars called synechiae when healed. There may be a minor tearing or micro-transection of the hymen externally without penetration internally, although the act often does not transect or separate the hymen. When lubricants are used, it is common for there to be swelling and redness which persist for two to seven days.\n\nIf a child is raped by forcible penetration of the vagina, there is a lot of mutilation of the vagina. However, significant pain is rare in vulvar coitus. Some children will have pain or cuts and transections, especially at the 6 o'clock position in the posterior fourchette. Sixty percent of the time, healing will occur leaving only a small scar. Commonly, a child with an extensive history of chronic molestation involving vulvar coitus will manifest nothing abnormal.\n\nWhen a penis is put into a young girl, there is a tremendous rush of immediate feeling. Children have the capacity to interpret the intense feeling at the entrance, but not to determine the depth of penetration. Many children who state that they have been penetrated have only experienced vulvar coitus. Many children think they have been vaginally penetrated when in fact entry was through the anus into the rectum.\n\nInjuries in the posterior fourchette are very indicative of sexual abuse. Also significant is a child's transhymenal diameter. In an eight-year-old\n\nchild, a seven-millimeter transhymenal diameter would be at the extreme upper limits of normal and could possibly be an abnormal finding. In a child of 12, 12 millimeters is the upper limit of the normal range. A transhymenal diameter over 12 millimeters would be a significantly abnormal finding.\n\nDuring the examinations of Carol and Lisa, Dr. Woodling spent about an hour separately with each child and pursued his normal methodology in examining them, including the use of colposcopy. First, he attempted to obtain histories from them. Lisa emphatically told Dr. Woodling that nothing had happened to her. On two occasions she spontaneously said, \"I can't say anything.\" Lisa also declined to have her mother present during the examination. Most children Lisa's age request to have their mothers with them. Whereas Lisa had periods of pause and retraction and not giving much of a history other than denial, Carol was very controlled and very precise in what she said. Carol also emphatically denied being sexually molested.\n\nCarol had a large tag at the 12 o'clock (supine) or 6 o'clock (prone) position of her anus, which is the most common spot for rectal penetration injuries. There was also an area of focal scarring. Carol requested that Dr. Woodling not examine her inside the vagina, and he honored this request. The transhymenal diameter was 15 millimeters. Carol could possibly accept full penetration of a normal adult penis without any tearing or injury.\n\nCarol's hymen was rounded and thickened, which is not inconsistent with whole hymenal trauma. There were, however, no transections or cuts through the hymen. The only transections were on the posterior fourchette. Hymenal rounding in a girl Carol's age is abnormal, and occurs when the area has had repeated episodes of injury with swelling in the deposition of connective or scarring tissue beneath the normal outer layers. Carol's hymen lacked the thin, filmy character usually found in children's hymens. Hymens commonly become toughened and rounded by repeated penile pressure around the hymen.\n\nTaking into account the rounded hymen, enlarged transhymenal diameter, and the injury at 6 o'clock, it was Dr. Woodling's impression that there was penile-type injury to the posterior fourchette due to some degree of penile penetration into the vagina. He could not say that it was full depth penetration because the hymen appeared intact without signs of scarring either by visual or colposcopic observation. This is the type of finding Dr. Woodling would see with vulvar coitus and partial vaginal penetration. It would not be inconsistent with full penetration depending on the hymen's degree of elasticity. In Woodling's opinion, a single episode of molestation would not cause this degree of rounding of the hymen or the large\n\ntranshymenal diameter. Dr. Woodling also found a teardrop-shaped area of hypopigmentation in the prone 12 o'clock area of Carol's anus, which is consistent with sodomy. The physical findings observed in Carol were inconsistent with her stated history of no trauma to the genital area.\n\nDuring Dr. Woodling's examination of Lisa, he observed injuries at both the 6 and 12 o'clock positions around her anus that represented themselves as old scars. Anything that was pushed into the anus could have caused the injury. Her transhymenal diameter was seven millimeters. Although Lisa's hymen was not rounded, Dr. Woodling's findings were inconsistent with Lisa's stated history.\n\nNeither Lisa's nor Carol's injuries were recent enough for Dr. Woodling to form an opinion as to when they occurred. However, his findings with regard to Carol were consistent with, and corroborated, a history of her being sodomized or having penises stuck in the area of her vagina approximately every other weekend until about the end of March 1983. His findings regarding Lisa were consistent with anal penetration causing injury during the same time period on every other weekend and could be consistent with noninjurious perivaginal contact. His findings would not be inconsistent with vulvar coitus if lubricants were used.\n\n\"The Kelly-Frye test conditions the admissibility of evidence based on a new scientific method of proof on a showing that the technique has been generally accepted as reliable in the scientific community in which it developed. [Citation.] The proponent must establish reliability of method and proper qualifications of the testifying witness. [Citation.] A single witness is insufficient to represent the views of an entire scientific community regarding reliability of the technique. [Citation.] Those techniques are not necessarily limited to manipulation of physical evidence but also include new scientific processes operating on purely psychological evidence. The purpose of the standard is to prevent the jury from being misled by unproven and ultimately unsound scientific methods. [Citations.]\" (People v. Jeff (1988) 204 Cal. App. 3d 309, 330 [251 Cal. Rptr. 135], fn. omitted; see People v. Kelly, supra, 17 Cal. 3d at p. 30; People v. Shirley (1982) 31 Cal. 3d 18, 54, fn. 32 [181 Cal. Rptr. 243, 723 P.2d 1354], cert. den. 459 U.S. 860 [74 L.Ed.2d 114, 103 S.Ct. 133].)\n\nDefendants contend that the trial court erred in summarily overruling the Kelly-Frye objection without requiring the prosecutor to establish the admissibility of Dr. Woodling's testimony. Defendants further contend that the testimony was inadmissible since use of a colposcope to establish sexual abuse has not gained general acceptance in the relevant scientific community. (See People v. Kelly, supra, 17 Cal. 3d at p. 30.)\n\nWe reject both contentions. This court recently held that a colposcopic examination was not a new scientific technique subject to the Kelly-Frye requirements. (People v. Luna (1988) 204 Cal. App. 3d 726, 734 [250 Cal. Rptr. 878], disapproved on other grounds in People v. Jones (1990) 51 Cal. 3d 34, 60 [270 Cal. Rptr. 611, 792 P.2d 643].) A colposcope is an instrument which allows the doctor to magnify and photograph the area to be examined. (Luna, supra, at p. 729, fn. 1.) Microscopes have long been accepted as scientifically reliable, and opinions given by a witness at trial based on his visual examination and observations made with the aid of a colposcope, in addition to the witness's own medical knowledge and observations, are admissible. (Id. at p. 733.)\n\nDefendants seek to distinguish Luna on the ground that there, the defendant only objected to the use of the colposcope, not to the witness's opinion as to the significance of the perceived injuries. However, our holding in Luna was based squarely on the analysis and decision in People v. Mendibles (1988) 199 Cal. App. 3d 1277 [245 Cal. Rptr. 553]. (People v. Luna, supra, 204 Cal. App. 3d at p. 733.)\n\nIn Mendibles, the defendant challenged the admission of a doctor's opinion that the findings of her physical examination of the victims were consistent with sexual abuse. In forming her opinion, the doctor relied primarily on patterns of scarring, deformities, and other abnormal changes in the victims' hymens. For part of the examination, she used a colposcope. The defendant invoked the Kelly-Frye rule and claimed that \"all of the foregoing\" constituted use of a new scientific technique. (People v. Mendibles, supra, 199 Cal. App. 3d at p. 1292.) The defendant was challenging not only the use of the colposcope, but the doctor's opinions based on the observations made during her examination.\n\nThe Mendibles court noted that there is a difference between development of a new scientific technique -- a novel method of proof -- and development of a body of medical knowledge and expertise. (People v. Mendibles, supra, 199 Cal. App. 3d at pp. 1292-1293.) The expression of an expert medical opinion as to the cause of a wound or injury falls outside of the realm of what is subject to the Kelly-Frye rule. An expert medical witness is qualified to give an opinion on the cause of a particular injury based on his or her deduction from the appearance of the injury itself. (Id. at p. 1293; see also, People v. Bledsoe (1984) 36 Cal. 3d 236, 249 [203 Cal. Rptr. 450, 681 P.2d 291]; People v. McDonald (1984) 37 Cal. 3d 351, 372-373 [208 Cal. Rptr. 236, 690 P.2d 709, 46 A.L.R.4th 1011]; In re Amber B. (1987) 191 Cal. App. 3d 682, 686 [236 Cal. Rptr. 623]; accord Onwan v. Commonwealth (Ky.App. 1987) 728 S.W.2d 536.)\n\nRelying on matters outside the record in this case, defendants contend that these principles are not applicable here because the microphenomena described by Dr. Woodling are not \"injuries,\" but in fact appear in a number of nonabused children. Accordingly, the argument runs, Dr. Woodling did not present a medical opinion on the cause of an injury, but merely gave a novel interpretation of microscopic markings, for which he presented no real foundation. To the extent defendants' argument is founded on matters outside the appellate record, it must be rejected. To the extent that defendants are subtly attacking Dr. Woodling's qualifications to testify as an expert or the trial court's permitting him to testify as such, the argument is meritless.\n\n\"A person is qualified to testify as an expert if he has special knowledge, skill, experience, training or education sufficient to qualify him as an expert on the subject to which his testimony relates. Whether a person qualifies as an expert in a particular case, however, depends upon the facts of the case and the witness's qualifications. [Citation.] The trial court is given considerable latitude in determining the qualifications of an expert and its ruling will not be disturbed on appeal unless a manifest abuse of discretion i[s] shown. [Citations.]\" (People v. Bloyd (1987) 43 Cal. 3d 333, 357 [233 Cal. Rptr. 368, 729 P.2d 802].)\n\nDefendants have failed to show an abuse of discretion here.\n\nV.\n\nExclusion of Polygraph Evidence\n\nPrior to trial, Tutti, Rick, Colleen, and Grace took and passed polygraph tests. All four subsequently moved for admission into evidence of the results of said examinations as well as the test graphs and expert opinion of the polygrapher. Tutti, Rick, and Colleen further offered to stipulate to take another test, to be administered by a qualified polygrapher chosen by the prosecutor after consultation with defense counsel. They agreed that the graphs, test results, and expert opinion of the polygrapher could be admitted into evidence at trial upon motion of either side, regardless of the test results. Grace offered to submit to a polygraph test as administered by any qualified expert requested by the prosecution. All four defendants contended that polygraph evidence was admissible under the truth-in-evidence section of Proposition 8,\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e62\u003c/span\u003e and that Evidence Code section 351.1 was unconstitutional.\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e63\u003c/span\u003e Dill and Forsythe orally joined the motion.\n\nThe prosecution moved to preclude any mention of polygraph tests. It refused to enter into the proposed stipulations, either with regard to admission of the results of the tests already taken, or with regard to further tests, because it believed (1) polygraph examination results are unreliable when the test is taken by a defendant who knows that the results will not be used if they are unfavorable to him; (2) once a defendant has been polygraphed and told he has passed the test, the results of a second test are worthless because the defendant's ability to respond has been affected by the first test; (3) the polygraph lacks substantial scientific validity; (4) there is a great potential for confusing the trier of fact; and (5) the examiner used by defendants was not competent.\n\nThe trial court denied defendants' motion to admit the polygraph results, based on Evidence Code section 351.1 and the prosecution's refusal to stipulate. It also granted the People's motion to preclude any mention of polygraph tests or results during trial.\n\nOn appeal, defendants contend the trial court erred by excluding evidence of the polygraph examinations and results. They argue that Evidence Code section 351.1 unconstitutionally violates ex post facto, compulsory process, due process, separation of powers, and equal protection principles.\n\nIn People v. Harris, supra, 47 Cal. 3d 1047, the defendant was tried in 1984 for offenses which occurred in December of 1982. The offenses were thus committed during the \"window\" period between Witherspoon v. Superior Court (1982) 133 Cal. App. 3d 24 [183 Cal. Rptr. 615], which held that a defendant could seek to establish the admissibility of polygraph results, and the effective date of Evidence Code section 351.1, which was intended by\n\nthe Legislature to overrule Witherspoon and create an exception to the truth-in-evidence section of Proposition 8. (Cf. People v. Kegler (1987) 197 Cal. App. 3d 72, 84 [242 Cal. Rptr. 897].)\n\nIn Harris, the California Supreme Court upheld denial of the defendant's motion to admit into evidence results of his polygraph examination. The court stated:\n\n\"[O]n a proper showing defendants must from time to time be permitted to demonstrate that advancement in a scientific technique has enhanced its reliability and acceptance in the scientific community, and to establish that the advances warrant admission of a previously excluded category of scientific evidence. Defendant here made no such preliminary showing, however. The applicable rule in this state, one unaffected by either Witherspoon or the adoption of section 28(d), is that the admissibility of evidence based on a new scientific technique is determined under the principles of Frye v. United States [ supra,] 293 Fed. 1013, 1014 [citations]. (People v. Kelly, supra, 17 Cal. 3d 24, 30.) Defendant offered only to call the polygraph examiner to establish the manner in which the test was conducted, an offer that was not sufficient to establish the admissibility of the results of the test or the examiner's opinion regarding defendant's veracity. Absent an offer of proof that the polygraph is now accepted in the scientific community as a reliable technique, the evidence was presumptively unreliable and inadmissible. The trial court neither erred in refusing to admit the evidence, nor denied defendant due process by excluding relevant evidence.\" (People v. Harris, supra, 47 Cal. 3d at pp. 1094-1095, fn. omitted.) In light of this conclusion, the Supreme Court expressly did not consider whether Evidence Code section 351.1 applied to the defendant's trial. (Id. at p. 1095, fn. 26.)\n\nIn the instant case, defense counsel did not make the requisite offer of proof. Van Meter argued that McMorris v. Israel (7th Cir. 1981) 643 F.2d 458(cert. den. 455 U.S. 967 [71 L.Ed.2d 684, 102 S.Ct. 1479]) contained a documented discussion of the scientific validity of the polygraph, and urged the trial court to read the case. He responded to Gindes's concerns about the reliability of defendants' polygraph examiner by implying that a lack of competence had not been shown in other situations in which said examiner was used. Eyherabide commented that he felt polygraph examinations were reliable since large corporations and the Federal Bureau of Investigation used them. Sims stated that Grace passed the test and, if given the opportunity, he believed he could show it was reliable. Rubin expressly stated that defendants were not asking for an evidentiary hearing because of Evidence Code section 351.1.\n\nNone of the foregoing constitutes a sufficient offer of proof under Harris, nor does the record suggest the trial court precluded the making of such an\n\noffer. The trial court never denied a defense request for an evidentiary hearing; defendants chose not to make such a request. Under these circumstances, the trial court properly excluded any evidence of or reference to polygraph results, and we need not address the constitutionality of Evidence Code section 351.1.\n\nVI.\n\nAppointment of Counsel for Child Victims\n\nAt the end of the first preliminary hearing, Gindes and Ms. Darling were concerned about Christine being traumatized if she had to talk about the case. They decided that Christine needed an attorney to represent her and protect her rights. J. J. Gianquinto was appointed. Judge Bowles subsequently appointed him in superior court to represent Johnny, Tommy, Brian, Amanda, Windy, Carol, Lisa, and Christine. Judge Bowles further ordered that all pleadings, notices, and motions be served on Gianquinto. Insofar as the record shows, the order was obtained ex parte by Gindes based on his own declaration, which stated in part that the children had been identified as victims of violations of section 288, subdivision (b), and that Judge Lund had appointed Gianquinto at the preliminary hearing. The declaration concluded, \"Defense counsel have made motions to require the child victims to submit to interviews and physical examinations. [para.] Because of the above, all of said children need counsel to represent them.\"\n\nThe court appointed counsel pursuant to former subdivision (c) of section 288, now subdivision (d) (hereinafter referred to as section 288, subdivision (d)). At all times pertinent, it provided:\n\n\"In any arrest or prosecution under this section the peace officer, the district attorney, and the court shall consider the needs of the child victim and shall do whatever is necessary and constitutionally permissible to prevent psychological harm to the child victim.\" (Minor amendments have since been made which do not affect the case at bench.)\n\nDefendants contend that appointment of counsel for the minors unconstitutionally interfered with their (defendants') rights to effective assistance of counsel, to prepare a defense, and to compulsory process. They argue that appointment of counsel was beyond the trial court's power, and that in any event, counsel impermissibly blocked access to the children. We conclude that appointment of counsel for minor victims is constitutionally and statutorily permissible, but that proper procedures were not followed in the instant case.\n\nIn Hochheiser v. Superior Court (1984) 161 Cal. App. 3d 777 [208 Cal. Rptr. 273], the prosecution sought an order whereby alleged child molestation victims would be permitted to testify via closed-circuit television. Based on testimony by the children's parents regarding behavioral problems exhibited by the children after they testified at the preliminary hearing, the trial court granted the order, relying on its inherent power to control the courtroom and develop new procedures. (Id. at pp. 780-783.) The Court of Appeal issued a writ of prohibition. In noting the need for judicial restraint, it found such a far-reaching innovation more appropriately left to the Legislature. (Id. at p. 783.)\n\nDefendants rely on Hochheiser as supporting their proposition that the trial court in the instant case was without the inherent power to appoint counsel for the minors. However, the Hochheiser court was faced with a somewhat different problem. As it noted, a court is \"'not the proper body to create procedural rules that tend to impinge on the traditional and arguably constitutional rights of a criminal defendant' . . . [citation].\" (Hochheiser v. Superior Court, supra, 161 Cal. App. 3d at pp. 784-785.) \"The closed-circuit television order herein raises significant and complex federal and state constitutional issues, potentially affecting petitioner's fundamental rights to a public trial, confrontation of witnesses against him and due process. [Citations.]\" (Id. at pp. 785-786, fn. omitted.) As will be discussed, appointment of counsel per se does not present such constitutional questions.\n\nDefendants also rely on the Hochheiser court's analysis of section 288, subdivision (d). Based on the settled rule that \"legislative enactments should not be construed to overthrow long-established principles of law unless such an intention is clearly shown by express declaration or necessary implication\" (Hochheiser v. Superior Court, supra, 161 Cal. App. 3d at pp. 791-792), the court examined the legislative history of section 288, subdivision (d) and found no indication that testimony via closed-circuit television was even considered (id. at pp. 790-791 and fn. 9). The court concluded: \"[T]he Summary of 1981 Crime Legislation Report compiled by the Joint Committee for Revision of the Penal Code merely states that 'S.B. 586 mandates that in any prosecution for child molestation the needs of the child to be protected from further psychological harm during arrest and prosecution be placed on an equal priority with the successful prosecution of the offender.' [Citation.] We construe this language to mandate a philosophical change focusing on the minor's needs. But we cannot read into this statute a legislative mandate for a closed-circuit television procedure or, indeed, any other specific procedure, which so drastically affects the rights of a defendant.\" (Id. at p. 791.)\n\nFrom the foregoing, defendants reason that appointment of counsel for the minors is not expressly authorized by the terms of the statute; therefore, it is not permitted. Again, however, the Hochheiser court was clearly facing a problem of constitutional dimensions. Unlike testimony by closed-circuit television, appointment of counsel for minor victims does not drastically affect the rights of a defendant, unless counsel is permitted to interfere with preparation or presentation of the defense. Accordingly, we conclude that, upon a proper showing and with proper limitations, a trial court may permissibly appoint counsel for alleged child victims pursuant to section 288, subdivision (d).\n\nThe procedures used in the instant case were not proper, however. First, there was no showing as to why the motion for appointment of counsel had to proceed ex parte instead of by way of noticed motion. As a policy matter, it would appear prudent to require a noticed hearing. Effective January 1, 1985, California Rules of Court, rule 227.5 provides:\n\n\"(a) Unless otherwise ordered or specifically provided by law, all pretrial motions, accompanied by points and authorities, shall be served and filed at least 10 calendar days, all papers opposing the motion at least five calendar days, and all reply papers at least two court days before the time appointed for hearing. Proof of service of the moving papers shall be filed no later than five calendar days before the time appointed for hearing.\n\n\"(b) The court may consider the failure without good cause of the moving party to serve and file points and authorities within the time permitted as an admission that the motion is without merit.\"\n\nCalifornia Rules of Court, rule 379 provides that in civil cases: \"An application for an order shall not be made ex parte unless it appears by affidavit or declaration (1) that within a reasonable time before the application the party informed the opposing party or the opposing party's attorney when and where the application would be made; or (2) that the party in good faith attempted to inform the opposing party and the opposing party's attorney but was unable to do so, specifying the efforts made to inform them; or (3) that for reasons specified the party should not be required to inform the opposing party or the opposing party's attorney.\"\n\nAlthough there is no corresponding provision in the criminal law and motion rules, we can conceive of no good reason why the same requirements should not prevail in criminal cases as well. Defense concerns about access to the children, etc., could be addressed and ground rules for counsel worked out.\n\nMore importantly, the showing made here was utterly insufficient. By its own terms, section 288, subdivision (d) requires the trial court to do what is\n\n(1) necessary and (2) constitutionally permissible to (3) prevent psychological harm to the child victim. Gindes's declaration did not show appointment of counsel for the minors to be necessary or even beneficial to prevent psychological harm, or to be constitutionally permissible. \"[T]he burden of proof on the issue of invocation of [the procedure] rests with the proponent of the procedure and the showing must be made by competent evidence.\" (Hochheiser v. Superior Court, supra, 161 Cal. App. 3d at p. 793.) Since each case must be determined on its own facts (ibid.), we need not determine what type of showing would be adequate. Presumably, however, it would involve more than the mere fact that defense counsel had filed some motions.\n\nDefendants also complain that appointment of counsel in the instant case was merely a ruse whereby the prosecution was able to block defense access to the children, something it could not do directly. Since this case is being reversed on other grounds, we need not determine the truth of this assertion.\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e64\u003c/span\u003e However, for the guidance of the trial court and the parties on remand, we note some pertinent legal principles.\n\nA victim is not a party to a criminal action, which \"is prosecuted in the name of the people of the State of California, as a party, against the person charged with the offense.\" (§ 684; People v. Parriera (1965)237 Cal. App. 2d 275, 282 [46 Cal. Rptr. 835].)Accordingly, counsel appointed for minor victims cannot have the same status, vis-a-vis his ability to control the proceedings, as the prosecutor or defense counsel.\n\nMoreover, \"[w]itnesses and potential witnesses belong to neither side to an adversary proceeding. Within constitutional limitations, access to potential witnesses should remain open to all parties in a legal controversy.\" (People v. Hannon (1977) 19 Cal. 3d 588, 601 [138 Cal. Rptr. 885, 564 P.2d 1203].) Thus, a prosecutor has no right to instruct witnesses not to talk with a defendant or defense counsel. (Clark v. Superior Court (1961) 190 Cal. App. 2d 739, 743 [12 Cal. Rptr. 191].) A defendant, having the right to compulsory process for obtaining witnesses to testify in his behalf, also has the right either personally or by attorney, subject in certain instances to the proper exercise of judicial supervision, to ascertain what their testimony will be. (Walker v. Superior Court (1957) 155 Cal. App. 2d 134, 140 [317 P.2d 130].) This does not mean, of course, that a court has the authority to\n\ncompel a witness to submit to an interview where the witness objects. (Ibid.) It simply means a defendant is free to interview a witness where the witness is willing. (People v. Mersino (1965) 237 Cal. App. 2d 265, 269 [46 Cal. Rptr. 821].) Where the witness informs one party of his or her knowledge of a case and refuses to speak to the other party's representative, the remedy is impeachment of the witness's testimony on the basis of bias. (People v. Hannon, supra, 19 Cal. 3d at p. 601.)\n\nSection 288, subdivision (d) cannot properly be interpreted so as to override a defendant's right to a fair trial or to fully present his or her case. Since the trial court is only empowered by the statute to do what is constitutionally necessary to prevent psychological harm, it stands to reason it cannot appoint counsel for the minors who will in essence act as the prosecution's agent, interfering arbitrarily with defense access to those children. While counsel will have ethical obligations toward the children as clients, counsel's role under the statute will be more advisory in nature: for example, he or she may coordinate prosecution and defense contact with the children; advise the children and their guardians on whether they are required to submit to physical examinations, interviews, etc., and the consequences at trial (such as impeachment) that are likely to occur if they do not; transmit their wishes to the court in appropriate circumstances -- for example, in determining whether to order the children to submit to physical examinations, the trial court may properly consider the potential for psychological harm to the victim (People v. Nokes (1986) 183 Cal. App. 3d 468, 479 [228 Cal. Rptr. 119]); and be present, upon the children's/guardians' request, during any interviews of the children to ensure that neither party becomes abusive or overbearing toward the children. The attorney could also have input in fashioning any of the court's orders, regarding discovery and other such matters, so as to minimize harm to the children. Depending on the circumstances of the case, counsel might also properly be involved in other aspects. He or she could not, however, have the power to veto defense access to the children, requests for discovery, or the like, except as that power is vested in the children/their guardians and conveyed to the court through the attorney.\n\nWe recognize the inherent tension between counsel's role under the statute and his or her ethical obligations to clients. Therefore, if a trial court appoints counsel for a child victim pursuant to section 288, subdivision (d), the attorney's role should be carefully spelled out following a full hearing, at which time the prosecution, defense, and proposed counsel should be allowed to participate and provide input. Should there be a situation in which ex parte appointment of counsel is necessary under the statute, a full hearing should follow within a reasonable time.\n\nVII.\n\nInstructional Error\n\nDefendants complain that various prejudicial instructional errors occurred. We conclude that although error occurred, in light of the reversal on other grounds, an analysis of prejudice need not be undertaken.\n\nA. The Children Touching Children Counts\n\nThis contention affects counts 13, 15, 16, 17, 20, 27, 44, 51, 52, and 53 as to everyone but Forsythe; 57 as to Grace, Dill, and Gina; and 7, 9, 29, and 31 as to Forsythe.\n\nDefendants contend that reversal is required of the children touching children counts, because there was no evidence to support conviction on an aiding and abetting theory, and special instruction A-19A did not adequately inform the jury of the intent it had to find in order to convict. Respondent counters that the instructions as a whole adequately informed the jury as to intent, and that in any event the instructions provided for conspiracy as an alternate theory of liability. In her reply brief, Colleen states that \"the question presented is not one of sufficiency of evidence, but an instructional one.\" She concedes the evidence was sufficient to convict appellants on these counts under a theory of constructive touching, but argues the jury was not instructed on that theory of guilt.\n\nAt the People's request, the trial court gave special instruction A-19A, which stated: \"In certain counts of the Information, it is alleged that a violation of Section 288(b) of the Penal Code as I have defined such has been committed, and a specific act is identified wherein the crime is set forth as one in which a child is alleged to have participated in a lewd and lascivious act with another child.\n\n\"In order to find a defendant guilty under such circumstances, it must be proved that, one, such defendant aided and abetted the commission of such act. I have previously instructed you on the definition of aiding and abetting. Or, two, a defendant was a member of a conspiracy wherein the lewd and lascivious act was the purpose of said conspiracy, and said act was done in furtherance of said conspiracy, and all of the other requirements that I have previously set forth exist as to the liability of a co-conspirator.\"\n\nThis instruction is at worst wrong, and at best incomplete. In order to be liable under an aiding and abetting theory, a defendant must \"act with knowledge of the criminal purpose of the perpetrator and with an\n\nintent or purpose either of committing, or of encouraging or facilitating commission of, the offense. [Citations.]\" (People v. Beeman (1984) 35 Cal. 3d 547, 560 [199 Cal. Rptr. 60, 674 P.2d 1318].) For example, if, during one of the orgies described in the instant case, defendant \"A\" makes Christine touch Johnny's penis, the other defendants can be convicted of violating section 288 on the ground that they aided and abetted \"A,\" and the jury should be so instructed. \"A,\" however, is not an aider and abettor (hence he or she cannot be convicted of violating section 288 on an aiding and abetting theory) unless one of the children has the requisite specific intent under section 288, i.e., unless one of the children is violating section 288. (See In re Billie Y. (1990) 220 Cal. App. 3d 127, 130-133 [269 Cal. Rptr. 212].) If one of the children is not violating section 288, there is nothing for \"A\" to aid and abet. \"A's\" liability is direct, not vicarious.\n\nWhere, as here, there is no evidence, and the prosecution does not proceed on the theory, that the children had the requisite lewd intent, the jury must be instructed that \"A's\" liability is as a principal, predicated on the theory of constructive touching (see People v. Meacham (1984) 152 Cal. App. 3d 142 [199 Cal. Rptr. 586]) or use of the child as the innocent agent (instrumentality) by which \"A\" committed the offense (see People v. Austin (1980) 111 Cal. App. 3d 110 [168 Cal. Rptr. 401]).\n\nPeople v. Roberts (1972) 26 Cal. App. 3d 385 [103 Cal. Rptr. 25], which was cited as the source of special instruction A-19A, does not hold to the contrary. In Roberts, the defendant was charged with aiding and abetting violations of section 288, in that he instructed and encouraged the five alleged victims to engage in sexual activities with each other. On the People's appeal from an order granting a section 995 motion to set aside two counts of the information, the Court of Appeal held that an aider and abettor need not have actual physical contact with the victim. (Roberts, supra, at p. 388.)\n\nThe court rejected Roberts's contention that since the children were incapable of committing a crime pursuant to section 26,\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e65\u003c/span\u003e he could not be guilty as a principal \"in any crime so committed\" under section 31. The court found it \"reasonable to assume that the Legislature intended by section 26 to merely relieve the persons listed therein from responsibility for criminal conduct and by section 31 to hold the aider and abettor liable as a principal 'in any crime so committed.'\" (People v. Roberts, supra, 26 Cal. App. 3d at p. 388.) The issue of the children's intent under section 288,\n\nor lack thereof, is not addressed, although the concept of relieving one from responsibility for criminal conduct appears to assume one committed a crime in the first place. Moreover, the cases relied on by the Roberts court all involve rape or statutory rape, which are general intent crimes. (People v. Griffin (1988) 46 Cal. 3d 1011, 1030 [251 Cal. Rptr. 643, 761 P.2d 103]; People v. Hernandez (1964)61 Cal. 2d 529 [39 Cal. Rptr. 361, 393 P.2d 673, 8 A.L.R.3d 1092].) Under these circumstances, Roberts does not stand for the proposition that a defendant can be convicted of aiding and abetting a violation of section 288, regardless of whether one or more of the actors (children touching children) themselves have the knowledge and specific intent required for a violation of that statute.\n\nRespondent contends that, assuming the aiding and abetting theory was incorrect, the jury was properly instructed that it could find defendants liable on a conspiracy theory. This ignores the problem of determining upon which theory the jury based its verdicts. In any event, since the case is being reversed on other grounds, we need not determine whether the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. (Cf. People v. Lee (1987) 43 Cal. 3d 666, 674-675 and fn. 1 [238 Cal. Rptr. 406, 738 P.2d 752]; People v. Macedo (1989) 213 Cal. App. 3d 554, 561-562 [261 Cal. Rptr. 754]; People v. Leffel (1988) 203 Cal. App. 3d 575, 585 [249 Cal. Rptr. 906].) Suffice it to say that, in the event of retrial on the counts involving children touching children, the jury should be instructed on the \"innocent agent/instrumentality\" and/or \"constructive touching\" theories of liability, but not on aiding and abetting insofar as the principal is concerned.\n\nB. Flight Instruction\n\nDefendants contend the trial court erred in instructing the jury in the language of CALJIC No. 2.52 (1979 rev.)(4th ed. bound vol.)\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e66\u003c/span\u003e (flight after crime), without making various modifications. The jury was instructed: \"The flight of a person immediately after he is accused of a crime is not sufficient in itself to establish his guilt, but it's a fact which, if proved, may be considered by you in the light of all other proved facts in deciding the question of his guilt or innocence. The weight to which such circumstance is entitled is a matter for the jury to determine.\n\n\"In giving this instruction, you must draw no inference that in fact this Court has determined that the flight of a defendant has or has not occurred. Whether or not evidence of flight shows a consciousness of guilt and the significance to be attached to such a circumstance, are matters for your determination.\"\n\nSpecifically, Dill argues that by refusing to expressly limit the instruction's applicability to Forsythe, the trial court erroneously permitted the jury to consider Dill's moving to a different residence as consciousness of guilt. Forsythe, on the other hand, contends the instruction should not have been given regarding him because his identity was in dispute (for this issue, but not for purposes of admission of the Knotts Street evidence), and that in any event the unmodified version wrongfully permitted the jury to consider Cliffy's and Clovette's flight to infer consciousness of guilt on the part of all defendants.\n\nFlight is relevant because it may demonstrate consciousness of guilt. Evidence of flight has no other probative value. (People v. Hill (1967) 67 Cal. 2d 105, 120 [60 Cal. Rptr. 234, 429 P.2d 586], cert. den. 389 U.S. 1009 [19 L.Ed.2d 607, 88 S.Ct. 572].) \"An instruction on flight is properly given if the jury could reasonably infer that the defendant's flight reflected consciousness of guilt, and flight requires neither the physical act of running nor the reaching of a far-away haven. [Citation.] Flight manifestly does require, however, a purpose to avoid being observed or arrested.\" (People v. Crandell (1988) 46 Cal. 3d 833, 869 [251 Cal Rptr. 227, 760 P.2d 423], cert. den. 490 U.S. 1037 [104 L.Ed.2d 408, 109 S.Ct. 1936].) A flight instruction should not be given where, for example, the evidence merely shows the defendant was arrested some time after the crime and miles away from the scene, since such evidence, standing alone, does not support an inference of guilt. (People v. Watson (1977) 75 Cal. App. 3d 384, 403 [142 Cal. Rptr. 134].)Moreover, where there is sufficient evidence of flight by some defendants but not others, the flight instruction should be limited accordingly. (People v. Mora (1956) 139 Cal. App. 2d 266, 274 [293 P.2d 522].)\n\nIn the case at bench, Gindes cross-examined Dill about where he was living when he learned that Rick and Tutti had been arrested and whether he moved shortly thereafter. Dill admitted that he and Carol Forsythe and her children moved into Carla Joyce's one-bedroom residence around the time of the arrests, but contended he did not recall whether it was before or after he learned of the arrests, and that he did not know he was wanted at the time. He continued to work at D \u0026 D Auto Sales.\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e67\u003c/span\u003e\n\nIn People v. Mora, supra, 139 Cal. App. 2d at page 274, sufficient evidence to support the flight instruction was found as to two defendants who, the day after the offense, failed to return home and spent the night elsewhere after learning the police were asking questions about them. In the instant case, however, leaving aside the implications of Gindes's questions, the only evidence was that Dill changed residences at a certain time and continued to work at his normal place of employment. Under these circumstances, there was no evidence to support the flight instruction as to Dill.\n\nGindes implicitly admitted as much when, during the instruction conference, he stated there was evidence of flight as to one person, that being Wayne Forsythe. Counsel for Dill requested the flight instruction be modified to indicate its application to Forsythe, but Gardiner objected and the trial court refused the modification.\n\nThe trial court found that such a modification might indicate to the jury that the court thought there was evidence of flight on Forsythe's part. However, pursuant to People v. Mora, supra, 139 Cal. App. 2d at page 274, the instruction should have been modified to tell the jury that the mere changing of residences, standing alone, did not constitute evidence of flight.\n\nAs far as Cliffy and Clovette are concerned, Ron Darling testified to efforts to coordinate their arrests in Boswell, Oklahoma, with the arrests of Gina, Grace, and Dill. He also testified about a search of their Boswell residence, which turned up an article about this case from a Bakersfield newspaper. In the jury's presence, Vendrasco sought to have the article admitted into evidence on the ground it was relevant to the knowledge of the people at the Boswell residence. Various defense counsel interposed relevancy objections, to which Vendrasco responded that flight of a coconspirator was relevant as to whether there was an admission of guilt. The article was eventually received into evidence. Outside the jury's presence, Gindes subsequently argued that evidence of Oklahoma and the flight of Cliffy and Clovette was not introduced to show a consciousness of guilt, but to show that at least two defendants were involved in preventing the prosecution\n\nfrom gaining access to Brandy and Bobo, i.e., a suppression of evidence, and also to show why Brandy and Bobo were not witnesses.\n\nAssuming the evidence was properly admitted for those purposes, the jury was never so informed. Under the circumstances, especially given Vendrasco's statements in the jury's presence, the jury could have inferred from the unmodified flight instruction that it could consider Cliffy's and Clovette's conduct as evidencing a consciousness of guilt on the part of all defendants. Accordingly, the instruction should have been modified to exclude consideration of Cliffy's and Clovette's conduct in this regard.\n\nForsythe is incorrect in his assertion that the instruction should not have been given as to him at all. According to his testimony, he was arrested on October 11, 1984, but had heard rumors about a warrant as early as August. He would not have visited Colleen in jail if he was hiding out, and he stayed in Tehachapi because of a job. However, Fields testified that after his arrest, Forsythe stated he had been lying low.\n\nWe have previously held that Forsythe's identity was not in issue\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e68\u003c/span\u003e and there was substantial evidence of his flight apart from his identification as a perpetrator. (See, e.g., People v. Batey (1989) 213 Cal. App. 3d 582, 585-588 [261 Cal. Rptr. 674]; People v. Rhodes (1989) 209 Cal. App. 3d 1471, 1475-1477[258 Cal. Rptr. 71].) The existence of alternative explanations for the conduct in question did not affect the propriety of the instruction, but merely went to the weight of the evidence. (Ibid.)\n\nC. Note-taking Instruction\n\nDefendants contend the trial court erred in refusing to give Forsythe's requested special instruction \"Y,\" a cautionary instruction regarding note taking: \"You have been provided with note pads and pencils so that you may take notes during the course of this trial. [para.] These notes are merely to assist you in the performance of your duties as jurors. You will be allowed to take them with you when you deliberate, but you must remember that the true and accurate record of the evidence has been kept by the stenographic reporter. [para.] If any dispute arises concerning the evidence, you may always request that the reporter read back to you the record of such evidence.\"\n\nRegardless of whether the court would have had a sua sponte duty to give such an instruction, it erred in failing to give the instruction upon request.\n\n(See People v. Harris, supra, 47 Cal. 3d at p. 1096; People v. Ghent, supra, 43 Cal. 3d at p. 758, cert. den. 485 U.S. 929; People v. Leach (1985) 41 Cal. 3d 92, 107 [221 Cal. Rptr. 826,710 P.2d 893].)\n\nD. Defense Instructions\n\nDefendants contend the trial court erred by refusing to give certain instructions requested by the defense.\n\n(a) Assessing Testimony of Children and Defendants\n\nDefendants requested, and the trial court refused, several instructions regarding the evaluation of children's testimony. CALJIC No. 2.20 (1980 rev.) (4th ed. pocket pt.) (credibility of witnesses) adequately covered most of the requested subjects, although not specifically with a view toward children's testimony. In any event, upon retrial the children will be considerably older than they were at the time of the original trial. Thus, we deem it neither necessary nor fitting to determine what, if any, instructions would be appropriate regarding their testimony. Nor are we faced with the question of what instructions should be given if, for some reason, the children's original trial testimony is admitted into evidence upon retrial.\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e69\u003c/span\u003e\n\nThe trial court also refused to give several requested instructions regarding the testimony of defendants. However, defendants have failed to show that the instructions given, taken as a whole, failed to adequately inform the jury of how to properly view their testimony.\n\n(b) Informers, Drug Addicts, and Immunized Witnesses\n\nDefendants requested several instructions aimed at witnesses Idolina Lopez, Linda Moten, and Laurancia Lopez. These instructions generally provided that the testimony of drug addicts, immunized witnesses, informers, and witnesses who agreed to testify in exchange for lenient treatment, was to be examined with greater caution than testimony of a normal witness. Additionally, some defendants requested a modified version of CALJIC No. 17.42 (jury must not consider penalty -- noncapital case), which would have instructed the jury not to consider punishment as to defendants, but that it could be considered with regard to any witness who had charges pending at the time he or she testified, or who was on probation. The trial court refused all of these requested instructions.\n\nAlthough the trial court was under no sua sponte duty to give cautionary instructions regarding the testimony of informers, drug addicts, or immunized witnesses, appropriate instructions should have been given upon request. (See People v. Malone (1988) 47 Cal. 3d 1, 27 [252 Cal. Rptr. 525, 762 P.2d 1249], cert. den. 490 U.S. 1095 [104 L.Ed.2d 998, 109 S.Ct. 2442] [informant]; People v. Leach, supra,41 Cal. 3d at p. 106 [immunized witnesses]; People v. Harvey (1984) 163 Cal. App. 3d 90, 112 [208 Cal. Rptr. 910] [immunized witnesses].) Defendants have failed to show prejudice, since the testimony in issue was not the sole basis for the convictions (People v. Hovey, supra, 44 Cal. 3d at p. 565, cert. den. 488 U.S. 871 [102 L.Ed.2d 157, 109 S.Ct. 188]; People v. Castro (1979) 99 Cal. App. 3d 191 [160 Cal. Rptr. 156]) and much of the information was covered in CALJIC No. 2.20 (1980 rev.) (4th ed. pocket pt.) (credibility of witnesses). We can assume the error will not be repeated in the event of a retrial. (See § 1127a, added by Stats. 1989, ch. 901, § 1.)\n\n(c) Reasonable Doubt\n\nDefendants contend the trial court erred in refusing requested instructions on the relationship of certain evidence to reasonable doubt. Grace's special instruction 16 provided:\n\n\"If, after examining all of the evidence, you find that you have a reasonable doubt that the acts alleged to have been committed by the defendants could have taken place in the location described by the witness(es), that reasonable doubt may be considered by you as one of the factors relating to the credibility of the witness(es) who testified to the acts occurring at such a location.\" Grace's special instruction 17 stated: \"If, after examining all of the evidence, you find that you have a reasonable doubt that the acts alleged to have been committed by the defendants could have taken place in the location described by the witness(es), that reasonable doubt may form the basis for a verdict of not guilty.\" Other defendants requested similar instructions. The jury was instructed in the language of CALJIC No. 2.90 (1979 rev.) embodying the language of section 1096. Pursuant to section 1096a, \"no further instruction on the subject of the presumption of innocence or defining reasonable doubt need be given.\" Nevertheless, a defendant has the right, upon request, to an instruction \"that directs attention to evidence from a consideration of which a reasonable doubt of his guilt could be engendered.\" (People v. Sears (1970) 2 Cal. 3d 180, 190 [84 Cal. Rptr. 711, 465 P.2d 847].)\n\nWhere the defendant's proposed instruction is repetitious of instructions already given, however, the trial court may properly refuse it. (People v. Wright (1988) 45 Cal. 3d 1126, 1134 [248 Cal. Rptr. 600, 755 P.2d 1049].)\n\nThe trial court may also properly refuse to give argumentative instructions, i.e., ones which \"invite the jury to draw inferences favorable to the defendant from specified items of evidence on a disputed question of fact . . . .\" (Id. at p. 1135.) Such inferences belong in counsel's argument to the jury, not in instructions. A proper instruction does not select \"'certain material facts, or those which are deemed to be material, and endeavor[] to force the court to indicate an opinion favorable to the defendant as to the effect of such facts, by incorporating them into instructions containing a correct principle of law.'\" (Ibid.) In a proper instruction, \"'[w]hat is pinpointed is not specific evidence as such, but the theory of the defendant's case.' [Citation.]\" (Id. at p. 1137, italics in original.)\n\nHere, the proposed instructions pinpointed specific evidence, i.e., the number of people allegedly in the room during the molestations, as well as the theory of defendants' cases. By requesting the court to emphasize, albeit subtly, the number of people versus the size of the rooms, defendants in essence attempted to obtain from the court an indication of opinion favorable to them with regard to that fact. The court's refusal of the instructions was proper.\n\n(d) Failure to Specify Applicability of Instructions\n\nDefendants challenge the trial court's failure to specify to which defendants the jury was to apply CALJIC No. 2.23 (credibility of witness -- conviction of a felony), People's special instruction A-6 (attempt to suppress evidence by offer of compensation to witness), People's special instruction A-7 (effort to suppress evidence by third person for defendant's benefit), CALJIC No. 2.52 (1979 rev.) (flight after crime), and CALJIC No. 2.71.5 (adoptive admission -- silence, false or evasive reply to accusation). This constituted prejudicial error, the argument runs, because the jury was instructed pursuant to CALJIC No. 1.11 that \"[t]he word 'defendant' as used in these instructions, applies equally to each defendant in this case except as you may be otherwise instructed.\" Therefore, they could have considered evidence of limited admissibility as to all defendants.\n\nThe flight instruction has been previously discussed. Had it been properly modified, it would have clearly applied only to Forsythe without prejudicing him by indicating whether he fled. Similarly, the instruction dealing with felony convictions could have only been interpreted as applying to Forsythe, as among the defendants.\n\nWith regard to the other challenged instructions, the jury was also instructed to consider the instructions as a whole (CALJIC No. 1.01 (1979 rev.)), and was instructed in the language of CALJIC No. 2.09 (evidence\n\nlimited as to purpose), CALJIC No. 2.07 (1979 rev.) (evidence limited to one defendant only), and CALJIC No. 2.08 modified (plaintiff's special instruction A-4; evidence of postarrest statement limited to defendant making statement). These instructions adequately reminded the jury of the limiting admonitions given them when certain evidence was admitted. To the extent limiting admonitions were not timely given, or the prosecutors argued evidence of limited admissibility for a purpose for which, or against a defendant against whom it was not admitted, we may assume the error will not be repeated in the event of a retrial.\n\nE. Instructions on Lesser Included Offenses\n\nDefendants contend the trial court prejudicially erred by failing to instruct on nonforcible lewd acts (§ 288, subd. (a)) as a lesser included offense of forcible lewd acts (§ 288, subd. (b)). They are incorrect.\n\n\"'\"It is settled that in criminal cases, even in the absence of a request, the trial court must instruct on the general principles of law relevant to the issues raised by the evidence. [Citations.] The general principles of law governing the case are those principles closely and openly connected with the facts before the court, and which are necessary for the jury's understanding of the case.\" [Citation.] That obligation has been held to include giving instructions on lesser included offenses when the evidence raises a question as to whether all of the elements of the charged offense were present [citation], but not when there is no evidence that the offense was less than that charged. [Citations.]' (People v. Sedeno (1974) 10 Cal. 3d 703, 715-716 [citations].)\" (People v. Wickersham (1982) 32 Cal. 3d 307, 323-324 [185 Cal. Rptr. 436, 650 P.2d 311].)\n\nInstructions on lesser included offenses need only be given \"if the accused proffers evidence sufficient to 'deserve consideration by the jury, i.e., \"evidence from which a jury composed of reasonable men could have concluded\"' that the particular facts underlying the instruction did exist. [Citations.]\" (People v. Wickersham, supra, 32 Cal. 3d at p. 324.) \"The trial court is not obligated to instruct sua sponte on necessarily included offenses unless the evidence would justify a conviction of such offenses.\" (Id. at p. 325; People v. Leach, supra, 41 Cal. 3d at p. 106.)\n\nIn the instant case, the court and counsel discussed whether the court had a sua sponte duty, under the evidence presented, to instruct on section 288, subdivision (a) as a lesser included offense of section 288, subdivision (b). No defense counsel requested such an instruction, and the court accurately observed that none of them relied on a defense involving the commission of a violation of subdivision (a) as opposed to subdivision (b). Accordingly,\n\nthe trial court found itself under no sua sponte duty to give the instruction.\n\nThe court's ruling was correct, and the failure to give instructions on section 288, subdivision (a) was not error. All defendants denied taking part in any molestations. According to them, either they were misidentified or the crimes never actually occurred. If the People's evidence were believed, they were guilty as charged. If the defendants' evidence were believed, they were not guilty of anything. Under no view of the evidence was any of them guilty of nonforcible molestation pursuant to section 288, subdivision (a). (See People v. Leach, supra, 41 Cal. 3d at p. 106; People v. Lema (1987) 188 Cal. App. 3d 1541, 1545 [234 Cal. Rptr. 173].)\n\nVIII.\n\nSufficiency of the Evidence\n\nDefendants contend the evidence is insufficient to support their convictions on various counts. They do not all challenge the same counts. For the sake of fairness and convenience, however, we will treat each as joining in the others' arguments. This approach will not disadvantage either respondent or any individual defendant.\n\nIt is settled that the test of sufficiency of the evidence is whether, reviewing the whole record in the light most favorable to the judgment below, substantial evidence is disclosed such that a reasonable trier of fact could find the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt. (People v. Johnson (1980) 26 Cal. 3d 557, 578 [162 Cal. Rptr. 431, 606 P.2d 738, 16 A.L.R.4th 1255].) Substantial evidence is that evidence which is \"reasonable, credible, and of solid value.\" (Ibid.) An appellate court must \"presume in support of the judgment the existence of every fact the trier could reasonably deduce from the evidence.\" (People v. Reilly (1970) 3 Cal. 3d 421, 425 [90 Cal. Rptr. 417, 475 P.2d 649].) It must not reweigh the evidence (People v. Culver (1973) 10 Cal. 3d 542, 548 [111 Cal. Rptr. 183, 516 P.2d 887]), reappraise the credibility of the witnesses, or resolve factual conflicts, as these are functions reserved for the trier of fact (In re Frederick G. (1979) 96 Cal. App. 3d 353, 367 [157 Cal. Rptr. 769], cert. den. 446 U.S. 934 [64 L.Ed.2d 787, 100 S.Ct. 2150]). Furthermore, an appellate court can only reject evidence accepted by the trier of fact when the evidence is inherently improbable and impossible of belief. (People v. Maxwell (1979) 94 Cal. App. 3d 562, 577 [156 Cal. Rptr. 630].)\n\nA. The Child Pornography Counts\n\nThis contention affects counts 14 (Johnny) and 23 (Tommy) as to everyone but Forsythe, and counts 8 (Johnny), 16 (Tommy), 32 (Amanda), 33 (Brandy), 34 (Bobo), and 35 (Windy) as to Forsythe.\n\nForsythe contends the evidence was insufficient to sustain convictions for violating section 311.4, subdivision (c), because the \"commercial purposes\" requirement was shown only by evidence that was wrongfully admitted.\n\nAt the time the alleged offenses were committed, section 311.4, subdivision (c) read: \"Every person who, with knowledge that a person is a minor under the age of 14 years, or who, while in possession of any facts on the basis of which he or she should reasonably know that the person is a minor under the age of 14 years, knowingly promotes, employs, uses, persuades, induces, or coerces a minor under the age of 14 years, or any parent or guardian of a minor under the age of 14 years under his or her control who knowingly permits the minor, to engage in or assist others to engage in either posing or modeling alone or with others for purposes of preparing a film, photograph, negative, slide, or live performance involving sexual conduct by a minor under the age of 14 years alone or with other persons or animals, for commercial purposes, is guilty of a felony and shall be punished by imprisonment in the state prison for three, six, or eight years.\"\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e70\u003c/span\u003e\n\nWe conclude that a commercial purpose was sufficiently shown, even leaving aside any evidence of questionable admissibility.\n\nLaurancia Lopez, who was housed with Grace, Colleen, and Tutti, testified to overhearing Grace say they had gotten rid of everything, and the camera that was seized was not good because it did not take good pictures.\n\nLinda Moten, Colleen's cellmate at another time, testified to hearing Colleen say she had burned some pictures that were evidence. According to Moten, Colleen also said they took pictures of children and sex acts and orgies and sold them to a guy in Los Angeles for drugs and stuff. Moten's testimony was admitted only against Colleen.\n\nToby Tyler testified in detail to equipment commonly used in the production of, and acts commonly seen in, commercial child pornography. His testimony raised the reasonable inference that the pornography allegedly\n\nproduced in the instant case was produced at least in part for commercial purposes. The fact that it may have also been produced, and the acts committed, for the personal gratification of the adults involved does not preclude a conviction for violating section 311.4, subdivision (c). Since the children testified that all of the defendants were involved on occasions when filming occurred, the evidence was sufficient as to all defendants.\n\nFurthermore, the evidence was sufficient even without Tyler's testimony. Johnny testified to a voice on the videotape that named the children and said what they were doing. The jurors could reasonably infer that it was unlikely someone making such a film solely for personal use would need to identify the participants, all of whom were either family members or acquaintances. Additionally, the equipment used as testified to by the children, especially the lighting, is fairly sophisticated when compared to that used for ordinary home videos. The amount of material being produced must also be considered, as well as the fact that none of it was found. Evidence was presented that tapes of virtually the same acts and participants were allegedly made every other weekend for approximately 18 months. It could be inferred that rather than being stockpiled for personal use the material was being sold as quickly as it was produced. There was no evidence that anyone involved possessed the equipment needed to copy this material; under such circumstances, it could reasonably be inferred that defendants did not keep master tapes but instead produced new material on a regular basis. Given the foregoing, the jury could have reasonably concluded that the pornography was filmed for commercial purposes. \"An appellate court must . . . uphold the trial court's disposition if, on the basis of the evidence presented, the jury's determination is reasonable.\" (People v. Garrison (1989) 47 Cal. 3d 746, 774 [254 Cal. Rptr. 257, 765 P.2d 419].)\n\nB. The Urine Drinking Counts\n\nThis contention affects counts 19 (Tommy), 46 (Johnny), and 47 (Brian) as to everyone but Forsythe, and count 12 (Tommy) as to Forsythe.\n\nDefendants contend that section 288 does not contemplate the drinking of urine; therefore there was insufficient evidence to sustain their convictions for violating section 288, subdivision (b) based on such acts. The argument is two-pronged: urine drinking does not constitute a lewd act, and it does not involve a touching.\n\nAt the time of the alleged offenses, section 288 provided in relevant part: \"(a) Any person who shall willfully and lewdly commit any lewd or lascivious act including any of the acts constituting other crimes provided for in\n\nPart 1 of this code upon or with the body, or any part or member thereof, of a child under the age of 14 years, with the intent of arousing, appealing to, or gratifying the lust or passions or sexual desires of such person or of such child, shall be guilty of a felony and shall be imprisoned in the state prison for a term of three, six, or eight years.\n\n\"(b) Any person who commits an act described in subdivision (a) by use of force, violence, duress, menace, or threat of great bodily harm, shall be guilty of a felony and shall be imprisoned in the state prison for a term of three, six or eight years.\"\n\nWe conclude that under the circumstances of the instant case, sufficient evidence supports the jury's conclusion that forcing the children to drink urine constituted a lewd act within the meaning of the statute.\n\nWebster's Third New International Dictionary (1986) partially defines \"lewd\" as: \"2 a : sexually unchaste or licentious : Dissolute, Lascivious b : suggestive of or tending to moral looseness : inciting to sensual desire or imagination : Indecent, Obscene, Salacious . . . .\"\n\n\"Lascivious\" is defined as \"1 : inclined to lechery : Lewd, Lustful . . . 2 : tending to arouse sexual desire : Libidinous, Salacious . . . .\"\n\nVirtually any act can fit this description, depending upon the intent with which it is done. As stated in People v. Hobbs (1952) 109 Cal. App. 2d 189, 192 [240 P.2d 411]: \"Section 288 of the Penal Code was enacted to protect children from the lustful advances and tamperings of callous and unscrupulous persons as well as from the assaults of depraved unfortunates. In all cases arising under this statute the purpose of the perpetrator in touching the child is the controlling factor and each case is to be examined in the light of the intent with which the act was done. In People v. Owen, 68 Cal. App. 2d 617, 620 [citation], it is said that 'It is not the accomplishment but the intent of the party that is the basis of the commission of the acts condemned in Penal Code section 288.' If intent of the act, although it may have the outward appearance of innocence, is to arouse, or appeal to, or gratify the lust, the passion or the sexual desire of the perpetrator it stands condemned by the statute, or, if it is intended to arouse feelings of passion or sexual desire in the child, it likewise stands condemned.\"\n\nCertainly it cannot be said that forcing a child to drink urine has the outward appearance of innocence.\n\nThe question of intent is one of fact, to be determined by the jury \"'except in a case where the facts proven afford no reasonable ground for\n\nan inference as to intent.'\" (People v. Pineda (1940) 41 Cal. App. 2d 100, 105 [106 P.2d 25].) Intent is rarely susceptible of direct proof and must usually be inferred from a consideration of all the facts and circumstances shown by the evidence. (People v. Lyles (1957) 156 Cal. App. 2d 482, 486 [319 P.2d 745].) A jury can conclude that defendant had the requisite intent from the circumstances surrounding the incident in question. (People v. Dontanville (1970) 10 Cal. App. 3d 783, 795-796 [89 Cal. Rptr. 172].) \"[I]f the evidence is sufficient to justify a reasonable inference that the requisite intent existed, the finding of its presence in a particular case, may not be disturbed on appeal [citations].\" (People v. Lyles, supra, 156 Cal. App. 2d at p. 486.)\n\nIn the instant case, the prosecution, during Vendrasco's opening argument, elected certain testimony as providing the basis for the counts in question. According to Tommy's testimony, Rick urinated in a bottle. At the time, Tutti was on the bed. Rick stuck the bottle up her vagina, then made Tommy, Johnny and Brian put the bottle in their mouths and drink some of the urine. Forsythe told Tommy he had to do this. All of the adults were in the room when the boys did this. Tommy further testified that all of the adults had their clothes off at the time and were watching the boys and laughing. Forsythe took pictures of this.\n\nBrian testified that he saw Rick urinate in a cup, after which Brian had to drink the urine. Rick said to do it, or he would beat Brian to death. This happened in Rick and Tutti's room; Johnny, Tommy, and Bobo also had to do it. Brian saw both Rick and Tutti urinate in the cup. All the children and adults were present. No one took a picture of Brian doing this; his clothes were on at the time.\n\nJohnny testified that Rick urinated into a bottle and made Johnny drink it. This was on an occasion when Rick forced Johnny to orally copulate him. The group of people were all around watching; Cliffy was taking pictures. Bobo, Windy, Brandy, Tommy, and Brian also had to drink urine on this occasion.\n\nGiven the circumstances surrounding the urine drinking, as testified to by the boys, there was sufficient evidence to support the jury's conclusion that the acts were done with a lewd intent. Tommy and Johnny both testified to being forced to commit the act during a period of numerous molestations. Consideration of all the circumstances shows that, while the acts may have been performed to an extent for pornographic purposes, the jury could reasonably conclude they were also performed to arouse, appeal to, or gratify the lust, passions, or sexual desires of the adults, who were standing around watching. Although Brian's testimony is less clear, since\n\naccording to him the act was not filmed and he was clothed, the presence of the orgy participants and the indisputable implication that molestations also occurred on this occasion, also indicate the existence of a lewd act. Given the absence of filming, the inference is even stronger that this act was intended to appeal sexually to the adults, as opposed to being merely for purposes of pornography.\n\nA closer question is whether these acts constituted \"touchings.\" \"[A] touching is required to commit a felonious section 288 lewd act.\" (People v. Austin, supra, 111 Cal. App. 3d at p. 113.) Defendants argue that here there was no physical touching between the bodies of themselves and the victims, nor was there a physical touching of the victim's body by the victim. Since the only contact shown was between the victim's mouth and a drinking vessel, the argument runs, there was insufficient evidence to show a violation of section 288. Respondent counters that a touching occurred because the bodily fluid of a coconspirator touched the lips, mouths, and digestive systems of the victims.\n\nIt is settled that the private parts of the victim's body need not be touched in order to sustain a section 288 conviction. (See, e.g., People v. Dontanville, supra, 10 Cal. App. 3d at p. 796.) Moreover, where, as here, a defendant is charged as an aider and abettor, he or she need not have physical contact with the victim in order to be guilty of a section 288 charge. (People v. Roberts, supra, 26 Cal. App. 3d at p. 388.)\n\nIn People v. Austin, supra, 111 Cal. App. 3d 110, this court upheld a section 288 conviction where the defendant did not touch the victim but had her pull down her own panties. While noting the need for a touching, we observed that the act of removing panties was such that the hands of the one doing the removing came in contact with the body of the child. (People v. Austin, supra, at pp. 113-114.) In Austin, the defendant caused the victim to physically touch her own person, and his intent was inferable from his conduct. (Id. at pp. 114-115.) We held that the touching necessary for a section 288 violation may be done by the child victim on his or her own person provided it is done at the instigation of a person who had the required specific intent. (Austin, supra, at p. 114.) We noted that at common law, one who caused a crime to be committed by an innocent agent was deemed guilty of the crime as a principal, which rule is contained in section 31.\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e71\u003c/span\u003e (Austin, supra, at p. 114.)\n\nIn People v. Meacham, supra, 152 Cal. App. 3d 142, a jury instruction based on Austin was approved. Although adopting the holding of Austin -- that the touching requirement could be satisfied by the child's touching his or her own person at the instigation of one having the requisite specific intent -- the Second Appellate District took a different route. Instead of reasoning that the child victim was the innocent agent of the perpetrator, the Meacham court found that a child's touching of its own genitalia at defendant's instigation constituted a \"constructive touching\" by defendant himself. (People v. Meacham, supra, at pp. 152-153.) The defendant instructed or posed the children in such a manner that their hands were caused to be placed on their own genitalia; these acts were imputable to defendant as if they had actually been done by defendant's own hands. (Id. at p. 154.)\n\nUnder these authorities we conclude that compelling a child to drink urine from a cup or bottle is a sufficient \"touching\" to constitute a violation of section 288. Under the facts at hand, these were lewd acts committed \"upon or with\" at least the mouths of the children. If a defendant lewdly touched a child with an object rather than with some part of that defendant's body, it would in our view be no less a violation of section 288. Since the requisite touching can be done by the child himself, the presence or absence of an object (here, the cup or bottle) seems to us to be immaterial.\n\nC. Conspiracy\n\nGrace, with Dill and Gina specifically joining, contends that the conspiracy allegation was improperly pleaded and there was insufficient evidence to support a conviction therefor.\n\n\"'A conspiracy is an agreement between two or more persons with the specific intent to agree to commit a public offense . . ., and with the further specific intent to commit such offense, followed by an overt act committed in this state by one or more of the parties for the purpose of accomplishing the object of the agreement.' [Citations.]\" (1 Witkin \u0026 Epstein, Cal. Criminal Law (2d ed. 1988) Elements of Crime, § 156, p. 173.)\n\n\"Conspiracy is a specific intent crime, with the intent divided into two elements: '(a) the intent to agree or conspire, and (b) the intent to commit the offense which is the object of the conspiracy . . . . To sustain a conviction for conspiracy to commit a particular offense, the prosecution must\n\nshow not only that the conspirators intended to agree but also that they intended to commit the elements of the offense.' [Citation.]\" (People v. Backus (1979) 23 Cal. 3d 360, 390 [152 Cal. Rptr. 710,590 P.2d 837].)\n\nThe first portion of defendants' contention has to do with the manner in which the overt acts were pleaded in the information. Basically, the argument turns on whether a period was erroneously inserted instead of a comma, so that the jury was not informed that the overt acts alleged had to be committed in furtherance of the conspiracy. Defendants argue the problem was compounded by the vague and ambiguous language of the overt acts.\n\nAssuming defects existed in the wording, however, they appeared on the face of the information and hence any objection was waived by defendants' failure to demur on this ground. (§ 1012; People v. White (1987) 188 Cal. App. 3d 1128, 1137, fn. 7 [233 Cal. Rptr. 772]; People v. Williams (1979) 97 Cal. App. 3d 382, 387-388 [158 Cal. Rptr. 778].) Additionally, the jury was instructed that the overt acts had to be committed for the purpose of accomplishing the object of the agreement. Absent strong and specific reason to think otherwise, we are required to assume the jury properly understood and applied the trial court's instructions. (See, e.g., Zuckerman v. Underwriters at Lloyd's (1954) 42 Cal. 2d 460, 478-479 [267 P.2d 777].)\n\nWith reference to the claim of insufficiency of the evidence, the totality of the circumstances supports the jury's finding that all defendants knowingly participated in a conspiracy to violate sections 288 and 311.4, subdivision (c).\n\n\"To establish agreement, the People need show no more than a tacit, mutual understanding between coconspirators to accomplish an unlawful act.\" (People v. Lauria (1967) 251 Cal. App. 2d 471, 475 [59 Cal. Rptr. 628].)\n\n\"[I]t is not necessary to prove that the parties met and actually agreed to perform the unlawful act or that they had previously arranged a detailed plan for its execution. Rather significantly, the agreement may be inferred from the conduct of the defendants mutually carrying out a common purpose in violation of a penal statute [citations].\" (People v. Lipinski (1976) 65 Cal. App. 3d 566, 575-576[135 Cal. Rptr. 451], italics omitted.)\n\nTaken in the light most favorable to the judgment below, the evidence shows that all defendants met numerous times for the purpose of molesting children and filming these acts. Johnny, for one, identified all defendants, including Grace, Dill, and Gina, as being present a lot of the times the \"nasty things\" occurred. Their agreement can be reasonably inferred from\n\nthe number of times this went on and the nature of the acts that occurred, as can their dual purpose and intent.\n\nD. Aiding and Abetting\n\nDefendants also contend their convictions cannot be sustained on an aiding and abetting theory.\n\nPeople v. Beeman, supra, 35 Cal. 3d 547sets forth the requirements for imposition of liability upon a theory of aiding and abetting:\n\n\"[T]he weight of authority and sound law require proof that an aider and abettor act with knowledge of the criminal purpose of the perpetrator and with an intent or purpose either of committing, or of encouraging or facilitating commission of, the offense. [Citations.]\n\n\"When the definition of the offense includes the intent to do some act or achieve some consequences beyond the actus reus of the crime [citation], the aider and abettor must share the specific intent of the perpetrator. By 'share' we mean neither that the aider and abettor must be prepared to commit the offense by his or her own act should the perpetrator fail to do so, nor that the aider and abettor must seek to share the fruits of the crime. [Citation.] Rather, an aider and abettor will 'share' the perpetrator's specific intent when he or she knows the full extent of the perpetrator's criminal purpose and gives aid or encouragement with the intent or purpose of facilitating the perpetrator's commission of the crime. [Citations.]\" (People v. Beeman, supra, 35 Cal. 3d at p. 560.)\n\nIn People v. Croy (1985) 41 Cal. 3d 1, 12, footnote 5 [221 Cal. Rptr. 592, 710 P.2d 392], the Supreme Court elaborated on Beeman and noted that the liability of an aider and abettor is vicarious. If that person's acts are undertaken with the intent that the actual perpetrator's purpose be facilitated thereby, the aider and abettor is guilty of the offense that he intended to facilitate and encourage, and also of any reasonably foreseeable offense that is committed by the person he aids and abets. Whether a person aided and abetted a crime is a question of fact (People v. Mitchell (1986) 183 Cal. App. 3d 325, 329 [228 Cal. Rptr. 286]), as is the question whether an offense is the natural and probable consequence of the act knowingly aided or encouraged (People v. Croy, supra, at p. 12, fn. 5).\n\nEvidence of intent is usually not direct. (People v. Beeman, supra, 35 Cal. 3d at p. 558.) An act which has the effect of giving aid and encouragement and which is done with the knowledge of the criminal purpose of the person aided may indicate intent. (Id. at p. 559.) Proof of\n\nintent may be made by way of inferences from a defendant's volitional acts which are done with knowledge of the probable consequences, and presence at the scene of the crime, while insufficient of itself to make one an aider and abettor, is one factor which tends to show intent. Other factors which may be considered include the defendant's failure to take steps to prevent the commission of the crime, companionship, and conduct before and after the crime. (People v. Jones (1980) 108 Cal. App. 3d 9, 15[166 Cal. Rptr. 131].)\n\nConsidering the evidence adduced at trial in light of the foregoing principles, it is clear substantial evidence supports defendants' convictions on the aiding and abetting theory.\n\nGrace argues that assuming she allowed a child to make oral contact with her breast, it does not necessarily follow she would condone the sodomizing of a small child. However, assuming she only intended to commit the first act, she nevertheless knowingly participated in a situation such that other, varied acts of molestation were the natural and probable consequences thereof. Moreover, despite Grace's argument that it is unlikely she was present during all of the charged acts, she has failed to demonstrate that she was not present, or that, assuming she was not present, she still was not vicariously liable for the offenses.\n\nDefendants' various claims of insufficiency of the evidence are rejected.\n\nIX.\n\nLate Election/Counts Not Shown at Preliminary Hearing\n\nDefendants contend they were prejudiced by the trial court's refusal to require the prosecution to elect the act upon which it relied to support each count. They also contend they were improperly convicted of numerous counts which were not shown by evidence adduced at their respective preliminary hearings. Respondent concedes defendants preserved both issues for appeal.\n\nThree separate preliminary hearings were held. The Rick/Tutti/Colleen hearing was held July 5-July 12, 1984. The Grace/Dill/Gina hearing was held July 24-August 8, 1984. The Forsythe hearing was held October 31-November 1, 1984. The only witness called by the prosecution to testify as to the charged offenses at each preliminary hearing was alleged child victim Johnny M.\n\nInformation No. 27641 was filed against Rick, Tutti, and Colleen on July 25, 1984. Information No. 27774 was filed against Grace, Dill, and Gina on\n\nAugust 16, 1984. For the most part, both informations were the same and alleged offenses occurring between January 1, 1982, and December 30, 1983. The charges all involve violations of the Penal Code. Force was alleged in all of the section 288 counts; in some the defendant allegedly forcing the child victim was specified; in most of the counts, it was expressly alleged that other defendants aided and abetted. For the present purposes, it is sufficient to merely identify the time frame, principal participants, and act alleged, as follows:\n\nPenal Code\n\nCount Section Summary of Charge\n\n1) 182 Conspiracy

27. On December 17, 1984, a few days after the start of trial, the People were granted permission to file amended informations as to all defendants except Forsythe. Colleen's motion to require an election of the acts relied on in counts 17, 20, and 27 was denied.\n\nThe amended informations made the following changes:\n\nPenal Code\n\nCount Section Summary of Charge\n\n12) 288(b) Bobo put his mouth between Colleen's legs.\n\n(Changed in Rick/Tutti/Colleen information\n\nonly.)\n\n17) 288(b) Johnny put his penis in contact with another\n\nchild.\n\n20) 288(b) Unspecified act involving Christine.\n\n21) 288(b) Tommy lay on Tutti; omitted allegation that\n\noffense occurred on different date than counts\n\n2-17.

(Changed in Grace/Dill/Gina\n\ninformation only.)\n\n48) 288(b) Rick put his penis on Brian's behind.\n\nColleen's demurrer, in which other defendants joined, was overruled. Additionally, her motion to dismiss (§ 995) counts 17, 20, and 27 was denied, as were Forsythe's and Dill's motions pursuant to section 995. Also denied was a defense motion regarding proof of uncharged acts. Defendants' motion for election of acts as to all counts was likewise denied.\n\nAt trial, the children testified to many more offenses than were charged in the informations. Further defense requests for election were denied, as were motions to strike testimony. Objections that the offenses testified to were not shown by evidence at the preliminary hearing were routinely overruled.\n\nOn May 20, 1985, following presentation of the People's evidence and just prior to resting their case, the prosecution orally moved to be allowed to \"make some minor amendments on the information to conform to proof and state elections.\" Defense objections were overruled. In the jury's presence, the following amendments were stated as to Forsythe's information:\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e75\u003c/span\u003e\n\nCount Summary of Charge\n\n12) Changed Tommy licked urine from a bottle to Tommy\n\ndrank urine from a bottle.\n\n18) Changed Tommy orally copulated Rick to Tommy put his\n\nmouth on Rick's penis.\n\n24) Changed Tutti lay on Brian to Brian lay on Tutti.\n\n25) Changed Tutti orally copulated Brian to Brian put his\n\nmouth on Tutti's vagina.\n\n28) Changed from unspecified act involving Windy to Rick put\n\nhis penis on Windy's behind.\n\n29) Changed from unspecified act involving Brandy to Brian lay\n\non Brandy.\n\n44) Changed misdemeanor child endangerment (§ 273a, subd.

They were amended as follows:\n\nCount Summary of Charge\n\n54) Changed from unspecified act involving Johnny to Johnny\n\nput his mouth on Dill's penis.\n\n55) Changed from unspecified act involving Brian to Brian put\n\nhis mouth on Forsythe's penis.\n\n56) Changed from unspecified act involving Tommy to Tommy\n\nput his mouth on Dill's penis.\n\n57) Changed from unspecified act involving Bobo to Windy\n\ntouched Bobo's privates.\n\n58) Changed from unspecified act involving Brian to Forsythe\n\nput his penis in contact with Brian's behind.\n\nIn response to the oral amendments, various defense counsel filed motions to dismiss (§ 995), motions opposing election, motions alleging some offenses were not shown by evidence adduced at the preliminary hearing, demurrers, and for a continuance. The motions were denied and the demurrers overruled.\n\nOn May 20, the day the amendments were stated in open court, the trial court \"requested\" the prosecution to file an amended information \"the next day or so.\" On June 4, following objections from defense counsel that nothing had been filed, the court ordered the prosecution to file an amended information by June 10, pursuant to amendments made in open court to conform to proof. On June 10, second amended informations were filed as to Rick/Tutti/Colleen and Grace/Dill/Gina, and a first amended information was filed as to Forsythe. Despite such a change not having been announced beforehand or approved by the court, these informations deleted any allegations of a time frame other than that of January 1, 1982, through December 30, 1983. Thus, there were no longer allegations that certain acts occurred on a date different from certain other acts within the same time frame.\n\nDuring the first of the prosecution's closing arguments, Vendrasco elected the testimony on which the People relied to prove the various allegations. Reference was made to pages of the reporters' transcripts, and Vendrasco read portions thereof. Prior to this election, the jury was instructed, pursuant to special instruction A-1: \"Ladies and Gentlemen of the jury, I have given you a general explanation of the nature and purpose of the arguments that will be given by the attorneys. There is, however, one additional purpose of the opening argument by the prosecution. It's required by law that the People make specific elections as to which specific acts constitute each crime alleged in the information.\n\n\"You will be informed as to the elected acts by the People in the following manner: First, a copy of the information, that's the complaint filed against each defendant will be available to you in your deliberations. Second, it's my understanding that the People will in their opening argument make specific references to the acts that they have elected for each alleged crime charged in the information. You should, therefore, take note of these acts that the prosecution has elected for each crime alleged in the information.\"\n\nThe jury was later instructed, pursuant to special instruction A-17: \"It is the responsibility of the prosecution to identify to the jury which specific act is alleged to constitute each crime alleged in the Information. The jury is bound by the identification of said act by the prosecutor. The prosecutor has identified said specific acts by pleading certain language in the Informations, and by referring to the acts identified in his opening argument to the jury.\"\n\nSpecial instruction A-18 was also read to the jury: \"You will be provided with a copy of the Informations filed by the People in these consolidated cases.\n\n\"As you have previously been told, the Information is a pleading which alleges what offenses the defendants are charged with. The Information consists of the formal charges against the defendants and is not evidence and must in no degree be considered as such. The Information is not provided to you to define or set forth the elements of any crime. The sole purpose of allowing you to use the Informations in your deliberations is to assist you in identifying the crimes and any overt acts which are alleged in such.\n\n\"The definition of each crime and the elements required to be proved, correction, and the elements required to prove each crime are included in the instructions that I am giving to you. The Information may not be used or considered for any other purpose.\"\n\nA. Failure to Compel Timely Election\n\nDefendants contend they were prejudiced by the trial court's refusal to require, prior to trial or at least early in the proceedings, the prosecution to elect the specific act upon which it was relying to prove each count. Respondent counters that any error was harmless and defendants' due process rights were not violated, as a unanimity instruction was given.\n\nRecently, in People v. Jones, supra, 51 Cal. 3d 34, our Supreme Court discussed the election doctrine and evidentiary and due process requirements in cases where the victim's testimony is \"generic,\" i.e., unparticularized as to details of the alleged offenses. In the instant case, however, the convictions were supported by evidence sufficiently specific as to time, place or circumstance. Moreover, Jones did not address the due process issue that exists where, as here, many of the specific offenses of which defendants were convicted were not shown by evidence adduced at the preliminary hearings. Thus, the problem is not merely one of election or jury unanimity, but whether defendants received adequate notice of the acts against which they might be called upon to defend. The prosecution could have elected at the outset of trial and the court could have given any number of unanimity instructions, but if defendants were ultimately forced to defend against offenses not shown at the preliminary hearing, there still existed a due process violation such that reversal is required.\n\nBecause the convictions are being reversed on other grounds, we need not determine whether any of the counts would have to be reversed solely because of the election problem, or whether the giving of the unanimity instruction would have cured the failure of election absent the preliminary hearing problem. The preliminary hearing problem must be addressed, however, because counts reversed on this ground could not merely be retried.\n\nInstead, the People would have to recharge them so there could be a preliminary examination thereon. This would leave defendants free to move for dismissal on whatever grounds might be appropriate, including statute of limitations, etc.\n\nB. Offenses Not Shown at Preliminary Hearing\n\nSection 739 provides in part: \"When a defendant has been examined and committed, . . . it shall be the duty of the district attorney of the county in which the offense is triable to file in the superior court of that county . . . an information against the defendant which may charge the defendant with either the offense or offenses named in the order of commitment or any offense or offenses shown by the evidence taken before the magistrate to have been committed . . . .\"\n\n\" [A]n information which charges the commission of an offense not named in the commitment order will not be upheld unless (1) the evidence before the magistrate shows that such offense was committed [citation], and (2) that the offense 'arose out of the transaction which was the basis for the commitment' on a related offense. [Citations.]\" (Jones v. Superior Court (1971) 4 Cal. 3d 660, 664-665 [94 Cal. Rptr. 289, 483 P.2d 1241].)\n\nA trial court has no jurisdiction to proceed on an information which runs afoul of this rule; such an information is defective and on motion must be set aside. (People v. Firestine (1968) 268 Cal. App. 2d 533, 536-537, fn. 3 [74 Cal. Rptr. 168].)\n\nThe same general rule holds where an amendment is concerned. Section 1009 provides in relevant portion: \"An . . . information may be amended by the district attorney, . . . without leave of court at any time before the defendant pleads or a demurrer to the original pleading is sustained. The court in which an action is pending may order or permit an amendment of an . . . information, . . . for any defect or insufficiency, at any stage of the proceedings, . . . An indictment or accusation cannot be amended so as to change the offense charged, nor an information so as to charge an offense not shown by the evidence taken at the preliminary examination . . . .\"\n\nWithin the limitations expressed in Jones v. Superior Court, supra, 4 Cal. 3d at pages 664-665, section 1009 gives the trial court discretion to permit an amendment of the information to charge any offense shown by evidence taken at the preliminary examination, at any time during trial, provided the defendant's substantial rights are not prejudiced thereby. (People v. Hernandez (1961)197 Cal. App. 2d 25, 31 [17 Cal. Rptr. 20].)Section 1009 preserves a defendant's substantial right to trial on a charge of\n\nwhich he had due notice. (People v. Flowers (1971) 14 Cal. App. 3d 1017, 1020-1021 [92 Cal. Rptr. 647].) In other words, section 1009 protects a defendant's right to due process.\n\nThis court has previously stated in an election context: \"Notice of the specific charge is a constitutional right of the accused. [Citation.] An information which charges a criminal defendant with multiple counts of the same offense does not violate due process so long as (1) the information informs defendant of the nature of the conduct with which he is accused and (2) the evidence presented at the preliminary hearing informs him of the particulars of the offenses which the prosecution may prove at trial. [Citations.] The information plays a limited but important role -- it tells a defendant what kinds of offenses he is charged with and states the number of offenses that can result in prosecution. However, the time, place, and circumstances of charged offenses are left to the preliminary hearing transcript. This is the touchstone of due process notice to a defendant. [Citation.] So long as the evidence presented at the preliminary hearing supports the number of offenses charged against defendant and covers the time-frame(s) charged in the information, a defendant has all the notice the Constitution requires. The defendant may demur if he or she believes the lack of greater specificity hampers the ability to defend against the charges. [Citation.]\" (People v. Jeff, supra, 204 Cal. App. 3d at pp. 341-342; see People v. Jones, supra, 51 Cal. 3d at p. 51.)\n\nRespondent seizes on the last portion of the foregoing and argues that, although certain counts were not supported by evidence of the specific acts averred in the charges, defendants suffered no lack of notice or prejudice from the disparity. Respondent argues: \"[E]ach Section 288 count identified a victim who was lewdly touched, and there were ample numbers of occasions testified to in the preliminary hearings showing these touchings with the specified victims. As appellants were bound over and charged as co-conspirators in each Section 288 charge, it was permissible to amend to conform to proof under Section 1009, to change the actor in each count where a lewd touching is charged against a certain victim. Under this reasoning, it would be permissible to amend the information to charge the victim was touched in the same way by another child, acting as an agent of one of the co-conspirators, or another adult . . . .\n\n\"Additionally, it could be argued that the informations simply were amended to conform to proof at trial on matters which were not essential elements of the crime. [Citation.] Each charge was stated against appellants that 'on or about' the time frame in issue, they 'willfully, unlawfully and lewdly committed a lewd and lascivious act upon and with the body of' a specified victim, and only then described the manner in which the act\n\noccurred. Under this reasoning, as long as the preliminary hearing provides evidence of a certain number of lewd acts upon the specified victim 'on or about' the time frame in issue, it should be immaterial in what manner the act is described in the charge. [Citations.]\n\n\"Under this approach, appellants are on notice to defend themselves against any touchings 'upon and with the body of' the victim within the time frame alleged in the information and at the green house. Consequently, . . . appellants suffered no harm, surprise or inability to defend themselves from the charge merely from the absence in the preliminary hearing transcript of the specific act with those players identified in the charge where it read 'in the following manner.' In People v. Britton (1936) 6 Cal. 2d 1, 4, it was noted that 'the particular mode or means employed in the commission of an offense' need not be alleged. '[P]articulars as to manner, means, place or circumstances need not in general be added to the stratutory [ sic ] definition. [Citations.] The . . . information need only charge the essential elements of the statutory offense. It then fairly apprises the defendant of what he is to meet at the trial.' [Citation.]\" (Fn. omitted.)\n\nThis argument ignores the differences in function between an information and the transcript of the preliminary hearing. It is true that an information need not notify a defendant of all the particulars of the crime charged. That role is left to the preliminary hearing transcript. Where, as here, the particulars are not shown by the preliminary hearing transcript, the defendant is not on notice in such a way that he has the opportunity to prepare a meaningful defense. Thus, in People v. Diaz (1987) 195 Cal. App. 3d 1375 [241 Cal. Rptr. 366], this court stated: \"As long as a criminal defendant has the meaningful opportunity to prepare a defense to specific acts, . . . no meaningful purpose would have been served in forcing this prosecutor to make an election at the beginning of the trial. The prosecution in the instant action never wavered from the evidence presented at the preliminary hearing. It is clear that the defendant in the Williams [ People v. Williams (1901) 133 Cal. 165 (65 P. 323)] case did not have the benefit of a preliminary hearing or a pretrial election by the prosecution to give him the opportunity to focus upon specific acts so that he could tender a meaningful defense. That is not the situation in the instant action.\" (Id. at p. 1383, italics added.) It is, however, the situation here.\n\nA hypothetical is in order. Suppose the evidence at a preliminary hearing revealed the commission of four distinct violations of section 288, say two oral copulations and two lewd touchings, involving victim X and occurring over a four-month period in defendant's bedroom. X, being a child, could not pinpoint the times of the offenses except to say that one set occurred near Christmas and the other following a school athletic event. Suppose\n\nfurther that the information charged in statutory language only two violations occurring within the four-month time frame. Further assume that the evidence at trial revealed the same acts occurring within the same time frame inside defendant's home.\n\nAbsent unusual circumstances, an amendment at trial to charge the remaining two violations would not violate due process, because the defendant was on notice from the preliminary hearing as to what charges he might potentially have to be prepared to defend against at trial. In such a situation, the defendant would not be prejudiced by a variance in time or place, so long as the evidence showed the offenses were committed within the original four-month period and somewhere in the house. The evidence adduced at the preliminary hearing placed the defendant on notice as to all possible charges; under normal circumstances, his opportunity to prepare an effective defense would not be affected merely because the evidence at trial showed the offenses occurred at a different time (within the time frame alleged in the original information) or a different room of the house. Even in alibi cases, neither the time (People v. Wrigley (1968) 69 Cal. 2d 149, 155 [70 Cal. Rptr. 116,443 P.2d 580]) nor the place at which an offense is committed (People v. Thompson (1934) 3 Cal. App. 2d 359, 362-363 [39 P.2d 425]; § 956) is material, and an immaterial variance will be disregarded (People v. LaMarr (1942) 20 Cal. 2d 705, 711 [128 P.2d 345].)\n\nIf the defendant is misled in making his defense, however, the variance is material. (People v. LaMarr, supra, 20 Cal. 2d at p. 711.) Suppose, in the foregoing hypothetical, the evidence at trial showed two acts of sodomy and two of sexual intercourse and the information was amended accordingly. In such a situation, the preliminary hearing transcript would not afford the defendant adequate notice of the specific acts against which he might have to defend. Moreover, in such a situation the opportunity to prepare a meaningful defense would obviously be adversely affected, since the change in alleged acts would affect medical testimony, cross-examination of the alleged victim(s), etc. If the amendments were not specified until the close of the People's case and the defendant were given no continuance to meet them, the problem would be even greater.\n\nTo say that due process would not be violated in the second situation because the defendant knew to defend against four violations of section 288 within a certain time frame is to ignore the reality of the situation. In the case at bench, the prosecution's attitude to the whole problem is revealed by a statement made by Gindes, outside the jury's presence, during argument over a motion to strike Windy's testimony as being without foundation and irrelevant to the charges at hand. As noted in our discussion of misconduct, he said:\n\n\"If they want people to testify against them that know dates, they should molest adults instead of children. Maybe adults can do that or accountants who keep diaries. We're dealing with little kids here. I think we're not having a due process right taken away from the defendant by the prosecution, they're denying themselves the right to have specific dates because of their choice of victims, and we have no control over that.\"\n\nThis concept, which goes hand-in-hand with the idea that defendants already know the times, acts, and places involved, \"assumes the guilt of the accused, or its practical equivalent . . . . Such a concept of presumed guilt is foreign to our system of criminal justice.\" (Sallas v. Municipal Court (1978) 86 Cal. App. 3d 737, 743 [150 Cal. Rptr. 543].) Criminal trials, regardless of the nature thereof, must be conducted in a manner consistent with the defendants' constitutional rights.\n\nThis is not to say that all particulars of an offense are material. Under the circumstances of the instant case, it does not appear due process was violated where the evidence at the preliminary hearing showed a specific act occurring on one occasion (for instance, the \"last time\"), whereas the evidence at trial placed the act on another occasion (for example, the \"time after the track meet time\"). Nor is it material that evidence at the preliminary hearings placed all molestations in Rick and Tutti's room, whereas some were shown at trial to have occurred in Carol and Lisa's room. Although defendants attempted to show that Rick and Tutti's room was too small to house an orgy of the size testified to by the children, it would not have been difficult for them to obtain the dimensions of the girls' room in order to attempt to show it was equally as unlikely a location. In fact, there was some testimony as to the size of the girls' room.\n\nIn some counts as charged in the second amended informations (first amended as to Forsythe), however, the specific act and/or actors changed from previous amendments, and/or the specific act involving specific actors was not shown by evidence adduced at a particular preliminary hearing. Respondent essentially argues defendants were on notice to defend against any and all lewd acts involving any child shown by preliminary hearing evidence to have been present during the molestations.\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e76\u003c/span\u003e To hold such variances are immaterial, however, would be to hold that due process is satisfied as long as the preliminary hearing evidence shows five violations of a statute and the evidence at trial shows the same number of violations of the same statute, regardless of the particulars. Such a holding would basically do away with use of the preliminary hearing transcript as a means for\n\ngiving fair notice. (See fn. 77.) This is not the law; a preliminary hearing transcript affording notice of the time, place and circumstances of charged offenses \"'is the touchstone of due process notice to a defendant.'\" (People v. Jeff, supra, 204 Cal. App. 3d at p. 342.)\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e77\u003c/span\u003e\n\nAccordingly, under the circumstances of the instant case, we reject respondent's argument that the convictions based upon the second amended informations (first amended, for Forsythe) were valid merely because the evidence at the preliminary hearings may have supported the same number of violations in the same time frame or because conspiracy was charged.\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e78\u003c/span\u003e We hold that convictions on the following counts must be reversed as to the individual defendants indicated because evidence supporting the offense charged in each of said counts was not adduced at defendants' respective preliminary hearings.\n\nSecond Amended Information No. 27641 (Rick, Tutti and Colleen)\n\nCount 11, charge: Rick put his penis in Windy's behind. The only evidence of such an act was adduced at Forsythe's preliminary hearing. Respondent offers no authority for using evidence from one defendant's preliminary hearing to supply evidence missing from another defendant's hearing, merely because the defendants subsequently have their cases consolidated for trial.\n\nCount 13, charge: Johnny touched Windy's genitals. No evidence of such conduct was adduced at the Rick/Tutti/Colleen preliminary hearing.\n\nCount 16, charge: Johnny put his penis in contact with Christine's genitals. Respondent concedes there was no evidence of such an act adduced at the Rick/Tutti/Colleen preliminary hearing.\n\nCount 20, charge: Tommy lay on top of Christine. There was no testimony about such an act at the Rick/Tutti/Colleen preliminary hearing. The\n\nfact that Christine was mentioned as being involved in other acts did not adequately notify defendants of the need to defend against this particular act.\n\nCount 24, charge: Tommy put his penis in contact with Tutti's vagina. Johnny did not testify to any such act during the Rick/Tutti/Colleen preliminary hearing, aside from Tommy lying on Tutti, which supports count 21. Since Johnny did not testify to any other such acts occurring between Tommy and Tutti, count 24 cannot stand.\n\nCount 27, charge: Christine touched Johnny's penis. Respondent concedes no evidence of such an act was adduced at the Rick/Tutti/Colleen preliminary hearing.\n\nCount 29, charge: Tutti touched her genitals to Brian's. Johnny did not testify to any act involving a touching between Tutti's and Brian's genitals, during the Rick/Tutti/Colleen preliminary hearing. Accordingly, count 29 cannot stand as to them.\n\nCount 31, charge: Brian lay on top of Tutti. No evidence was presented as to such an act at the Rick/Tutti/Colleen preliminary hearing.\n\nCount 37, charge: Forsythe touched Windy's privates. No evidence of such an act was adduced at the Rick/Tutti/Colleen preliminary hearing.\n\nCount 39, charge: Rick touched Christine's genitals. Respondent concedes no such act was shown by evidence adduced at the Rick/Tutti/Colleen preliminary hearing. Although there was evidence at that hearing that Rick sodomized Christine, the elected trial testimony consisted of Rick touching her genitals with his hand.\n\nCount 44, charge: Windy touched Johnny's penis. During the Rick/Tutti/Colleen preliminary hearing, Johnny did not testify to performing any act with Windy.\n\nCounts 51, 52 and 53, charges: Brian lay on top of Amanda, Brian touched Amanda's genitals, and Amanda touched Brian's privates. Respondent concedes no evidence of any such acts was adduced at the Rick/Tutti/Colleen preliminary hearing.\n\nSecond Amended Information No. 27774 (Grace, Dill and Gina)\n\nCount 4, charge: Rick put his penis in Johnny's mouth. At the Rick/Tutti/Colleen preliminary hearing, Johnny testified to sucking white\n\npowder from Rick's penis on three separate occasions. One of these occasions is used to support count 2. This means that one occasion is available to support count 4. Although as elected Johnny's testimony at trial made no reference to white powder, the presence or absence of powder is an immaterial detail insofar as due process is concerned. The basic act is oral copulation of Rick by Johnny; that act is supported as to Rick, Tutti, and Colleen. However, in the Grace/Dill/Gina preliminary hearing, Johnny testified to one act of sucking white powder from Rick's penis, and no other acts of oral copulation of Rick by him at the green house. This being the case, count 4 cannot stand as to Grace, Dill, or Gina.\n\nCount 11, charge: Rick put his penis on Windy's behind. The only evidence of such an act was adduced at Forsythe's preliminary hearing. Respondent argues that since the evidence showed that Rick put his penis in Windy's vagina (such evidence was adduced at the Grace/Dill/Gina preliminary hearing only -- it was not shown by testimony at the Rick/Tutti/Colleen hearing), defendants received adequate notice of the acts against which they might be required to defend. However, defendants were placed on notice to defend against a certain type of act (intercourse) involving Rick and Windy, and were not placed on notice regarding a different type of act (sodomy).\n\nCount 12, charge: Bobo put his mouth between Colleen's legs. At the Rick/Tutti/Colleen preliminary examination, Johnny testified that during the last time, Bobo and other children put their mouths on Colleen's breasts and between her legs. At the Grace/Dill/Gina hearing, there was no testimony about an act involving Bobo and Colleen.\n\nCount 13, charge: Johnny touched Windy's genitals. At the Grace/Dill/Gina preliminary hearing, Johnny testified that during the last time, he had to stick his penis in the vaginas of Windy and \"Rick's girls.\" He also testified to putting his mouth between Windy's legs more than once. While either of these acts could technically support count 13, the prosecution elected testimony wherein Windy essentially stated that she and Johnny were forced to touch each other's genitals with their hands. Johnny did not testify to such contact between Windy and himself at the Grace/Dill/Gina preliminary hearing.\n\nCount 16, charge: Johnny put his penis in contact with Christine's genitals. Respondent concedes there was no evidence of such an act adduced at the Grace/Dill/Gina preliminary hearing.\n\nCount 19, charge: Tommy drank urine. At the Rick/Tutti/Colleen preliminary hearing, Johnny testified that besides himself, Tommy, Brian, and\n\nBobo had to drink Rick's urine on different occasions. At the Grace/Dill/Gina hearing, however, Johnny only testified to drinking urine himself.\n\nCount 20, charge: Tommy lay on top of Christine. There was no testimony about such an act at the Grace/Dill/Gina preliminary hearing. (See discussion of count 20 regarding Rick, Tutti, and Colleen, ante.)\n\nCount 22, charge: Rick put his penis in Tommy's mouth. At the Rick/Tutti/Colleen hearing, Johnny testified that during the track meet time, Tommy sucked white powder from Rick's penis and also orally copulated Rick on other occasions. At the Grace/Dill/Gina preliminary examination, Johnny testified to Tommy and other children sucking Rick's penis the last time. However, this act is used to support count 8. Since at the Grace/Dill/Gina hearing Johnny only testified to one act of Tommy orally copulating Rick, count 22 cannot stand as to those three defendants.\n\nCount 24, charge: Tommy put his penis in contact with Tutti's vagina. During the Grace/Dill/Gina preliminary hearing, Johnny testified to Tommy and others sucking Tutti's breasts and putting their penises in her vagina during the last time. That testimony supports count 21. Since Johnny did not testify to any other such acts occurring between Tommy and Tutti, count 24 cannot stand.\n\nCount 25, charge: Rick put his penis in Tommy's mouth. At the Rick/Tutti/Colleen preliminary hearing, Johnny testified to various occasions when Tommy orally copulated Rick. One occurred the last time; it supports count 8. Another occurred the track meet time; it supports count 22 as to Rick, Tutti, and Colleen. Count 25 is supported as to Rick, Tutti, and Colleen, by Johnny's testimony that Tommy also put his mouth on Rick's penis the time after the last time, when Johnny was in fourth grade. At the Grace/Dill/Gina hearing, however, Johnny only testified to one such act, which supports count 8. Accordingly, count 25 cannot stand as to Grace, Dill, or Gina.\n\nCount 27, charge: Christine touched Johnny's penis. Respondent concedes no evidence of such an act was adduced at the Grace/Dill/Gina preliminary hearing.\n\nCount 37, charge: Forsythe touched Windy's privates. No evidence of such an act was adduced at the Grace/Dill/Gina preliminary hearing.\n\nCount 39, charge: Rick touched Christine's genitals. Respondent concedes no such act was shown by evidence adduced at the Grace/Dill/Gina preliminary hearing.\n\nCounts 42 and 43, charges: Johnny sucked Colleen's breasts and put his penis on Colleen's vagina. At the Rick/Tutti/Colleen preliminary examination, Johnny testified to sucking Colleen's breasts and putting his penis in her vagina during the last time. At the Grace/Dill/Gina hearing, he did not testify to performing any act with Colleen. Accordingly, counts 42 and 43 cannot stand as to those three defendants.\n\nCount 44, charge: Windy touched Johnny's penis. At the Grace/Dill/Gina preliminary examination, Johnny testified to putting his penis in Windy's vagina. Technically, this could support count 44 as to those defendants; however, the trial testimony elected in support of count 44 involved Windy \"playing\" with the penises of Johnny and other boys. There was no testimony at the Grace/Dill/Gina hearing about Windy touching Johnny's penis with her hand or \"playing\" with his penis.\n\nCount 45, charge: Tommy put his mouth to Colleen's vagina. At the Grace/Dill/Gina preliminary hearing, Johnny did not testify to any act involving Tommy and Colleen. Accordingly, count 45 cannot stand as to those three defendants.\n\nCount 47, charge: Brian drank urine. At the Rick/Tutti/Colleen hearing, Johnny testified that Tommy, Brian, and Bobo had to drink pee on different occasions. Although not tied to any specific time frame within the overall dates alleged (e.g., the last time, track meet time, etc.), the act of drinking urine is specific enough so that Rick, Tutti, and Colleen were on notice to defend against it, and also to permit them to formulate a meaningful defense thereto. At the Grace/Dill/Gina preliminary examination, however, the only testimony about urine was that Johnny was made to drink it. Accordingly, count 47 cannot stand as to those three defendants.\n\nCounts 49 and 50, charges: Brian sucked Colleen's breast and put his mouth on her vagina. At the Rick/Tutti/Colleen preliminary hearing, Johnny testified that on the last time, Brian and other children put their mouths on Colleen's breasts and between her legs. Brian also performed the acts on another occasion. However, at the Grace/Dill/Gina hearing, Johnny did not testify to any activity between Brian and Colleen. Accordingly, counts 49 and 50 cannot be sustained as to them.\n\nCounts 51, 52 and 53, charges: Brian lay on top of Amanda, Brian touched Amanda's genitals, and Amanda touched Brian's privates. Respondent concedes no evidence of any such acts was adduced at the Grace/Dill/Gina preliminary hearing.\n\nCount 55, charge: Brian put his mouth on Forsythe's penis. Although such an act was shown by evidence adduced at Forsythe's preliminary\n\nhearing, no such act was testified to at the Grace/Dill/Gina hearing. Accordingly, count 55 cannot stand as to those three defendants.\n\nCount 57, charge: Windy touched Bobo's privates. Respondent concedes the evidence adduced at the preliminary hearing does not show this specific act.\n\nCount 58, charge: Forsythe put his penis in contact with Brian's behind. Although such an act was shown by evidence adduced at Forsythe's preliminary hearing, it was not shown at the Grace/Dill/Gina hearing. Accordingly, the count cannot stand.\n\nAmended Information No. 28244 (Forsythe)\n\nCount 4, charge: Rick put his penis in Johnny's mouth. At Forsythe's preliminary hearing, Johnny testified to one act of sucking white powder from Rick's penis. That testimony supports count 2. Since Johnny did not testify to any other acts of oral copulation of Rick by him at the green house, count 4 is not supported as to Forsythe. (See discussion of count 4 regarding Grace, Dill, and Gina, ante.)\n\nCount 10, charge: Johnny put his penis to Clovette's genitals. Respondent contends this count is supported by Johnny's testimony that on more than one occasion, he had to put his mouth on Clovette's breast and vagina, and stick his penis in her vagina. However, that testimony was adduced at the Grace/Dill/Gina preliminary hearing. At Forsythe's preliminary examination, Johnny testified to Clovette's presence. However, the only specific act testified to involving Clovette was when Tommy stuck his penis in Clovette's vagina.\n\nCount 18, charge: Tommy put his mouth on Rick's penis. At Forsythe's preliminary examination, Johnny testified to Tommy and other children putting their mouths on Rick's penis during the last time. However, since count 15 alleges the same act and Johnny only testified to one such act in Forsythe's preliminary hearing, counts 15 and 18 cannot both be sustained.\n\nCount 20, charge: Tommy licked white powder from Rick's penis. Although Johnny testified at Forsythe's preliminary examination to Tommy and other children putting their mouths on Rick's penis, said act only supports count 15. (See discussion of count 18 regarding Forsythe, ante.)\n\nCount 24, charge: Brian lay on Tutti. Although Johnny never specifically testified to Brian lying on Tutti, this count could arguably be supported by his testimony that Brian put his penis in Tutti's vagina. However, because\n\nof the limited number of such acts specifically shown by Johnny's testimony (two), if counts 22 and 23 stand, count 24 cannot. Respondent concedes this count, assuming we do not accept the argument that Forsythe was on notice to defend against any and all lewd acts involving Brian.\n\nCount 29, charge: Brian lay on Brandy. Respondent concedes there was no evidence of this act adduced at Forsythe's preliminary hearing.\n\nCount 31, charge: Amanda touched Brian's privates. Johnny did not testify to such an act at Forsythe's preliminary hearing.\n\nRecapitulation -- under the foregoing analysis, the following counts must be reversed:\n\nAs to Rick, Tutti, and Colleen : Second Amended Information No. 27641, counts 11, 13, 16, 20, 24, 27, 29, 31, 37, 39, 44, 51, 52, and 53.\n\nAs to Grace, Dill, and Gina : Second Amended Information No. 27774, counts 4, 11, 12, 13, 16, 19, 20, 22, 24, 25, 27, 37, 39, 42, 43, 44, 45, 47, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 55, 57, and 58.\n\nAs to Forsythe : Amended Information No. 28244, counts 4, 10, 18, 20, 24, 29, and 31.\n\nRespondent asserts that retrial of the foregoing counts is not barred by double jeopardy principles. We agree. \"[J]eopardy attaches to a defendant when he is placed on trial before a court of competent jurisdiction upon a valid indictment or information before a jury duly impaneled and charged with his deliverance.\" (Jackson v. Superior Court (1937) 10 Cal. 2d 350, 352 [74 P.2d 243, 113 A.L.R. 1422], italics added.) Since an information cannot validly charge, or be amended to charge, an offense not shown by evidence adduced at the preliminary hearing, the first amended (Forsythe) and second amended (remaining defendants) informations were invalid as to the foregoing counts. Accordingly, jeopardy never attached as to those counts, and retrial thereon is not barred by double jeopardy principles. (See People v. Tong (1909) 155 Cal. 579, 581-584 [102 P. 263] [where information improperly charges count, verdict on said count is a nullity and double jeopardy does not bar retrial thereon].)\n\nThis does not mean, however, that retrial is automatically permissible. Since defendants were never validly charged with said counts, the People\n\nwould be required to file new charges with reference to those offenses. Such action might be barred by the statute of limitations. This court need not determine this issue; if the prosecution elects to proceed on the counts in question, defendants can bring appropriate motions in the trial court.\n\nX.\n\nJury Selection Issues\n\nDefendants complain of alleged prejudicial errors occurring in the formation of the venire and during the selection of the trial jurors. Since we reverse on other grounds, we deem it unnecessary to address these complaints other than to note that the People concede that automatic exclusion from the venire of prospective jurors residing outside a 75-mile radius from the City of Bakersfield \"was unauthorized by any legislation, rule or regulation, as the superior court district included the entire county.\"\n\nXI.\n\nPending Motions\n\nAll motions pending before this court not ruled upon in this opinion or not previously ruled upon are denied.\n\nThe judgments are reversed.\n\nThe trial court is directed to enter its order dismissing the following counts:\n\nCounts 11, 13, 16, 20, 24, 27, 29, 31, 37, 39, 44, 51, 52, and 53 of Second Amended Information No. 27641;\n\nCounts 4, 11, 12, 13, 16, 19, 20, 22, 24, 25, 27, 37, 39, 42, 43, 44, 45, 47, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 55, 57, and 58 of Second Amended Information No. 27774;\n\nCounts 4, 10, 18, 20, 24, 29, and 31 of Amended Information No. 28244.\n\nDisposition\n\nThe judgments are reversed. The trial court is directed to enter its order dismissing the following counts: Counts 11, 13, 16, 20, 24, 27, 29, 31, 37, 39, 44, 51, 52, and 53 of Second Amended Information No. 27641; Counts 4, 11, 12, 13, 16, 19, 20, 22, 24, 25, 27, 37, 39, 42, 43, 44, 45, 47, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 55, 57, and 58 of Second Amended Information No. 27774; Counts 4, 10, 18, 20, 24, 29, and 31 of Amended Information No. 28244.\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003e51. The Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution provides in part: \"In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial, by an impartial jury . . ., and to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation; to be confronted with the witnesses against him; to have compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor, and to have the Assistance of Counsel for his defence.\" Article I, section 15 of the California Constitution provides in part: \"The defendant in a criminal cause has the right to a speedy public trial, to compel attendance of witnesses in the defendant's behalf, to have the assistance of counsel for the defendant's defense, to be personally present with counsel, and to be confronted with the witnesses against the defendant . . . .\"\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003e52. In Dominick, Copeland, a jail trusty, had been a narcotics informant in the past. Dominick was placed in his unit, apparently according to normal housing procedures, and a deputy asked Copeland to explain basic jail procedures to Dominick. Approximately one month earlier, Copeland had contacted a district attorney's investigator, who had no connection with defendant's case, and asked about receiving consideration on his sentence if he came across anything. The investigator told him to stay in touch, but did not tell him to seek out information or pay him to act as a listening post in jail. Ultimately, Dominick confessed to Copeland, who offered the information to authorities if certain conditions were met. Eventually, he received money and time off of his sentence. Dominick's conviction was affirmed, there being no evidence Copeland was acting on instructions to deliberately elicit information. Defendant's confession was spontaneous and voluntary. (People v. Dominick, supra, 182 Cal. App. 3d at pp. 1198-1199.)\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003e53. In Talamantez, an officer intercepted a letter from inmate Daniels to another inmate regarding a heroin smuggling operation run in jail by defendant. Daniels agreed to provide information and was instructed to obtain information from defendant only regarding the drug operation. As a result of said information, defendant's conversation with a visitor was monitored. During that conversation, defendant made incriminating statements regarding a murder, the details of which he subsequently also told Daniels. His statements to Daniels were not in response to any questions. Daniels received an early release after supplying narcotics information. In holding there was no interference with the relationship between client and counsel, the court noted Daniels did not engage defendant in surreptitious interrogation, informed on a different crime from that for which defendant was in custody, and obtained information from defendant which was not in response to any questions by Daniels. The court noted it was not Daniels's role to act as an informant in the murder case. (People v. Talamantez, supra, 169 Cal.

Aranda-Bruton error is now judged under the \"harmless beyond a reasonable doubt\" standard of Chapman v. California, supra, 386 U.S. at page 24[17 L.Ed.2d at p. 711]. Such error is harmless where properly admitted evidence is overwhelming and the evidence proved by the incriminating extrajudicial statement is cumulative of other direct evidence presented through eyewitness testimony or defendant's own mouth.

Counts 29-33 and count 35 alleged offenses committed between January 1, 1982, and December 30, 1983, \"but upon a date different than alleged in counts to [ sic ] through twenty-four, inclusive.\"\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003e74. Counts 54-58 were charged against Grace, Dill, and Gina only.\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003e75. Amendments to children's names, such as changing a last name, were also made. They are insignificant and so are not shown. Defendants do not contend they were prejudiced by such changes.\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003e76. Respondent concedes that counts 11, 13, 16, 20, 27, 31 (Rick/Tutti/Colleen only); 37, 39, 43, 44, 51, 52, and 53 (everyone but Forsythe); count 57 (Grace/Dill/Gina only); and counts 23, 24, 28, and 29 (Forsythe) must be reversed if we do not agree with this argument.\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003e77. This conclusion is not changed by section 956, which states: \"When an offense involves the commission of, or an attempt to commit a private injury, and is described with sufficient certainty in other respects to identify the act, an erroneous allegation as to the person injured, or intended to be injured, or of the place where the offense was committed, or of the property involved in its commission, is not material.\" Section 956 states a rule of pleading; the errors described therein are not fatal because the accused receives notice of the particulars of the offense from the preliminary hearing transcript. (See People v. Gordon (1945) 71 Cal. App. 2d 606, 610-611 [163 P.2d 110].)\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003e78. In People v. Jones, supra, 51 Cal. 3d 34, the Supreme Court did not address or reverse the holding of the Court of Appeal that, as to certain counts, reversal was required because amending the time frame alleged in the information changed the offense to one not shown by evidence at the preliminary hearing and the change violated the defendant's fundamental right to be apprised as to when the events occurred.\u003c/span\u003e\n\n",
