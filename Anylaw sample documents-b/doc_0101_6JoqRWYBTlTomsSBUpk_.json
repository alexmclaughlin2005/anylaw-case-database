    "body": "MEMORANDUM OPINION\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nEvery ten years, after the census, the Florida legislature is requiredto redraw the State's congressional districts and the State Senate andHouse districts to adjust for population shifts. The 2000 census revealedthat Florida's population grew by more than 3 million people during the1990s. As a result, Florida was apportioned two additionalrepresentatives in the United States House of Representatives, and theFlorida legislature, which was controlled by a substantial Republicanmajority in each house, adopted a redistricting plan for the State'sCongressional districts to adjust for the shifts in population and theincrease in the number of representatives. On March 27, 2002, GovernorJohn Ellis \"Jeb\" Bush signed into law House Bill 1993, which establishedthe lines for Florida's 25 congressional districts.\n\nFollowing the 2000 census, the Republican-controlled Floridalegislature also adopted redistricting plans for the State Senate andHouse districts to adjust for the population changes since the 1990census. On March 22, 2002, the Florida legislature passed House JointResolution 1987, which established the lines for Florida's 40 Senatedistricts and 120 House districts.\n\nFollowing the passage of the redistricting legislation, plaintiffs andintervenors brought this action for declaratory and injunctive reliefagainst the Speaker of the Florida House of Representatives, thePresident of the Florida Senate, the Governor of Florida, the FloridaSecretary of State, and the Florida Attorney General.\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e1\u003c/span\u003e Plaintiffsalleged (1) that the process used to arrive at the redistricting plan wasinadequate under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendmentand Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. § 2000d,because minorities were not given sufficient opportunity to participate;(2) that the reapportionment plan led to the dilution of black\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e2\u003c/span\u003evoting power\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e3\u003c/span\u003ein violation of section 2 of the Voting Rights Act of1965, 42 U.S.C. § 1973; and (3) that the Florida legislaturepolitically gerrymandered the congressional districts to favorRepublicans, thereby violating the rights of Democratic voters guaranteedby the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e4\u003c/span\u003e Weaddress each of these claims in turn.\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e5\u003c/span\u003e\n\nIn part I, we address the plaintiffs' \"process\" claims. First, wepresent detailed findings of fact regarding the redistricting process andthe opportunity afforded Florida citizens to participate in thatprocess. We conclude that plaintiffs have failed to present sufficientevidence to show that defendants were motivated by discrimination againstblacks or Hispanics in deciding what redistricting software or allocationmethod to use, where to hold public hearings, when to hold publichearings, what type of notice to provide, or whether to consider inputfrom Florida citizens and Democratic legislators in drawing theredistricting plans. Absent such a showing, plaintiffs' process claimsmust fail.\n\nIn part II, we address plaintiffs' vote dilution claims. We presentdetailedfindings of fact comparing voting behavior by race in performingblack districts existing before and after the redistricting process atissue in this litigation. We conclude that in the districts underchallenge in this litigation, black candidates of choice\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e6\u003c/span\u003e willcontinue to prevail in most elections. We outline the three Ginglespreconditions for prevailing on a claim of vote dilution under section 2of the Voting Rights Act: (1) geographic compactness, (2) politicalcohesiveness, and (3) bloc voting on behalf of the majority group.Thornburg v. Gingles, 478 U.S. 30, 50-51, 106 S.Ct. 2752, 2766-67, 92L.Ed.2d 25 (1986). Because it is undisputed that these preconditions aremet, section 2 clearly required the drawing of at least some number ofdistricts likely to perform for black candidates of choice. We concludethat the legislature satisfied its section 2 obligation by drawingperforming black districts which are, in fact, likely to perform for blackcandidates of choice. Therefore, under the redistricting plans, blackvoters will not have \"less opportunity than other members of theelectorate to participate in the political process and to electrepresentatives of their choice,\" 42 U.S.C. § 1973 (b) — i.e.,black voting power has not been diluted — and plaintiffs havefailed to establish a violation of section 2 of the Voting Rights Act.\n\nFinally, in part III, we address plaintiffs' political gerrymanderingclaims. We begin by holding that the three Gingles preconditions apply toequal protection claims in the political gerrymandering context just asthey do in the racial vote dilution context. Next, we address thetwo-prong Bandemer test for unlawful political gerrymandering —legislative intent to discriminate and discriminatory effects. Davis v.Bandemer, 478 U.S. 109, 127, 106 S.Ct. 2797, 2808, 92 L.Ed.2d 85 (1986).Although we conclude that the Florida legislature intended to draw thecongressional districts in a way that favors Republicans, we concludethat plaintiffs have failed to demonstrate discriminatory effects thatare serious enough to warrant federal court intervention. Plaintiffsfailed to establish the preconditions of geographic compactness,political cohesiveness, and bloc voting on behalf of the majority group.Plaintiffs also failed to establish that, under a totality of thecircumstances, the redistricting plan gives Democrats \"less opportunityto participate in the political process and to elect candidates of theirchoice.\" Id. at 131, 106 S.Ct. 2809. Thus, this final claim too mustfail.\n\nI. THE \"PROCESS\" CLAIMS\n\nThe Martinez plaintiffs alleged in count I of their second amendedcomplaint that the process, practice, and procedure adopted and employedby Florida's legislature in conducting redistricting hearings andadopting the state's congressional and legislative plans violated theEqual Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and42 U.S.C. § 1983. They also alleged a violation of Title VI of theCivil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. § 2000d, based on the sameconduct. We refer to these claims as the \"process\" claims.\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e7\u003c/span\u003e Because,as we explain below, these claims all require a showing of intentionaldiscrimination, and because the question of discrimination is a questionof fact, and not an issue of law,we briefly summarize the legalframework which governs the \"process\" claims.\n\nA. LEGAL FRAMEWORK\n\nThe central purpose of the Fourteenth Amendment, as articulated bycases like Washington v. Davis, 426 U.S. 229, 239, 96 S.Ct. 2040, 2047,48 L.Ed.2d 597 (1976), is \"racial neutrality in governmental decisionmaking.\" Clark v. Putnam County, 293 F.3d 1261, 1266 (11th Cir. 2002).\"[A]s a general rule, `[d]istinctions between citizens solely because oftheir ancestry are by their very nature odious to a free people whoseinstitutions are founded upon a doctrine of equality.'\" Oyama v.California, 332 U.S. 633, 646, 68 S.Ct. 269, 275, 92 L.Ed. 249 (1948)(quoting Hirabayashi v. United States, 320 U.S. 81, 100, 63 S.Ct. 1375,1385, 87 L.Ed. 1774 (1943)).\n\nTo prevail on their equal protection claim relating to theredistricting hearing and adoption processes, the Martinez plaintiffsmust show, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the Floridalegislature acted with racially discriminatory intent. See Washington,426 U.S. at 240, 96 S.Ct. at 2048 (noting that school desegregation caseshave \"adhered to the basic equal protection principle that the invidiousquality of a law claimed to be racially discriminatory must ultimately betraced to a racially discriminatory purpose\"); Village of ArlingtonHeights v. Metropolitan House. Dev. Corp., 429 U.S. 252, 265, 97 S.Ct.555, 563, 50 L.Ed.2d 450 (1997) (\"Proof of racially discriminatory intentor purpose is required to show a violation of the Equal ProtectionClause.\"); cf. Crawford-El v. Britton, 523 U.S. 574, 592-94, 118 S.Ct.1584, 1594, 140 L.Ed.2d 759 (1998) (rejecting argument that where stateof mind is an element of a constitutional claim, mens rea must be shownby clear and convincing evidence). Although the Martinez plaintiffs neednot establish that a racially discriminatory motive was the sole orprimary purpose, they have to establish that it was a motivating factor ofthe challenged process. See Village of Arlington Heights, 429 U.S. at265, 97 S.Ct. at 563 (noting that a plaintiff need not prove that a\"challenged action rested solely on racially discriminatory purposes\");Garza v. County of Los Angeles, 918 F.2d 763, 771 (9th Cir. 1990)(holding that the redistricting plan of county supervisor districtsviolated the Equal Protection Clause where the supervisors who drew thedistricts were motivated by both an intent to fragment the Hispanicvoting population and an intent to preserve incumbencies, because\"discrimination need not be the sole goal in order to be unlawful\")(citing Arlington Heights, 429 U.S. at 265, 97 S.Ct. at 555). The factthat biased state decision makers may have had other motives that werenot discriminatory does not make their conduct any less intentional.See, e.g., Barnett v. Daley, 32 F.3d 1196, 1199 (7th Cir. 1994) (holdingthat \"the fact that discrimination may have an ulterior motive that isnot discriminatory does not make it any the less intentional\" for equalprotection purposes in a challenge to a redistricting plan of cityalderman wards). Once the Martinez plaintiffs establish a prima faciecase of discrimination, the defendants may only overcome the presumptionof unconstitutional action by showing that permissibly neutral criteriaand procedures produced the discriminatory result. See Washington, 426U.S. at 241, 96 S.Ct. at 2048.\n\nAn invidious discriminatory racial purpose need not be express, and\"may often be inferred from the totality of the relevant facts includingthe fact, if it is true, that the law bears more heavily on one race oranother.\" Washington, 426 U.S. at 241-42, 96 S.Ct. at 2048-49. Thefactors that may be probative of adiscriminatory purpose or intentinclude: (i) the impact of the official action; (ii) the historicalbackground of the decision, particularly if it reveals a series ofofficial actions taken for invidious purposes; (iii) a specific sequenceof events leading up to the challenged decision; (iv) departures fromnormal procedural sequences; and (v) substantive departures from factorsusually considered important by the decision maker and which stronglyfavor a decision contrary to the one reached. See Village of ArlingtonHeights4, 429 U.S. at 266-67, 97 S.Ct. at 564-65.\n\nLike the equal protection claim, the Title VI and section 1983 claimsare dependent on a showing of intentional discrimination. First, Title VIprovides no greater protection than the Equal Protection Clause. SeeUnited States v. Fordice, 505 U.S. 717, 732 n. 7, 112 S.Ct. 2727, 2737n. 7, 120 L.Ed.2d 575 (1992) (\"Our cases make clear and the parties donot disagree that the reach of Title VI's protection extends no furtherthan the Fourteenth Amendment.\"); Elston v. Talladega County Bd. ofEduc., 997 F.2d 1394, 1405-06 n. 11 (11th Cir. 1993) (\"Since Title VIitself provides no more protection than the Equal Protection Clause— both provisions bar only intentional discrimination — wewill not engage in a separate discussion of the Title VI statutoryanalysis, as such an inquiry would duplicate our equal protectionanalysis.\"). Second, it is well settled that a section 1983 plaintiffmust show a violation of a right secured by the Constitution or federallaw in order to prevail. See, e.g., Collins v. City of Harker Heights,503 U.S. 115, 120-22, 112 S.Ct. 1061, 1066-67, 117 L.Ed.2d 261 (1992);Baker v. McCollan, 443 U.S. 137, 140, 99 S.Ct. 2689, 2692, 61 L.Ed.2d 433(1979); Montero v. Temple Union High School Dist., 158 F.3d 1022, 1026(9th Cir. 1998). A \"finding of intentional discrimination is a finding offact\" subject to clearly erroneous review. Anderson v. City of BessemerCity, 470 U.S. 564, 573, 105 S.Ct. 1504, 1511, 84 L.Ed.2d 518 (1985); seealso, e.g., Easley v. Cromartie, 532 U.S. 234, 241-58, 121 S.Ct. 1452,1458-66, 149 L.Ed.2d 430 (2001) (reviewing, under the clearly erroneousstandard, finding of three-judge court that congressional redistrictingplan was racially motivated). We therefore proceed to make our subsidiaryfindings of fact and our ultimate findings on the issue of intentionaldiscrimination.\n\nB. PRELIMINARY FINDINGS OF FACT FOR THE \"PROCESS\" CLAIMS\n\n1.

On May 3, 2002, the Florida Supreme Court issued its opinionvalidating the state legislative districts under article III, section 16of the Florida Constitution and following limited review of applicableprinciples arising under the United States Constitution. See In reConstitutionality of House Joint Resolution 1987, 817 So.2d 819 (Fla.2002). In its opinion, the Florida Supreme Court found that \"the maximumpercentage deviation between the largest and smallest number of people per[House district] (statistical overall range) is 2.79%.\" Id. at 825. Incontrast, \"the maximum percentage deviation between the largest andsmallest number of people per [Senate district] (statistical overallrange) is 0.93%.\" Id. at 826. The Florida Supreme Court thus held that\"the Legislature has achieved a mathematical preciseness in the districtsthat complies with the equal protection requirements of both the Floridaand United States Constitutions.\" Id. The Florida Supreme Court alsosaid, among other things, that due to time constraints it was not able torule on fact-intensive federal challenges to the state legislativedistricts, including claims ofpolitical gerrymandering under theFourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection Clause and claims based onsection 2 of the Voting Rights Act, 42 U.S.C. § 1973. See id. at828-29. Such challenges, the Florida Supreme Court said, would have to bebrought in a court of \"competent jurisdiction.\" Id. at 829.\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e8\u003c/span\u003e\n\n57. On May 14, 2002, Attorney General Butterworth filed suit in theUnited States District Court for the District of Columbia, initiallyasking for a declaration regarding the validity of the variousredistricting plans under section 5 of the Voting Rights Act, and thenamending his complaint to request a declaration of validity. See Floridav. United States, Case No. 1:02 CV 00941 (D.D.C. 2002) (the \"D.C.action\"). A three-judge court was then impaneled in the District ofColumbia pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2284.\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e9\u003c/span\u003e\n\n58. On May 15, 2002, certain Martinez plaintiffs — Mr. Warren,Ms. Holmes, and SVREP — along with Representative Alcee Hastingsand the UNO Federation for Community Services, Inc., moved to interveneas plaintiffs in the D.C. action. These Martinez plaintiffs alleged, inpart, that the section 5 submissions by Governor Bush, Speaker Feeney, andPresident McKay were improper because they were not made by AttorneyGeneral Butterworth.\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e10\u003c/span\u003e On May 28, 2002, the three-judge court in theD.C. action granted the motion to intervene, but aligned the intervenorsas defendants.\n\n59. On May 24, 2002, the Deutsch intervenors — RepresentativeDeutsch, Ms. Grace, Mr. Totin, Mr. Johnson, Ms. Lobben, Ms. Mayeri, Ms.Nachimson, and Mr. Rizzo — moved to intervene in the D.C. action asdefendants.\n\n60. On May 29, 2002, Governor Bush, Speaker Feeney, and President McKaymoved to intervene in the D.C. action as plaintiffs.\n\n61. In the D.C. action, the Department of Justice took the positionthat the pre-clearance submission had been properly made by GovernorBush, Speaker Feeney, and President McKay.\n\n62. On June 4, 2002, the three-judge court granted the motions tointervene filed by Governor Bush, Speaker Feeney, and President McKay andby the Deutsch intervenors, aligning the Governor, the Speaker, and thePresident as plaintiffs and the Deutsch intervenors as defendants.\n\n63. On June 7, 2002, the United States Department of Justicepre-cleared Florida's congressional redistricting plan, stating by letterthat the Attorney General \"d[id] not interpose any objection\" to thatplan. By directing the letter to Governor Bush, Speaker Feeney, andPresident McKay, the Department of Justice apparently concluded that thesubmission of the congressional plan by these Florida officials did notconstitute a change in voting procedure that had to be preclearedpursuant to section 5.\n\n64. On June 7, 2002, the Governor, the Speaker, and the President movedon an emergency basis to dismiss the D.C. action as moot.\n\n65. On June 10, 2002, the United States also moved to dismiss the D.C.action as moot.\n\n66. On June 13, 2002, the three-judge court in the D.C. action grantedthe motions to dismiss filed by the United States, Governor Bush, SpeakerFeeney, and President McKay, and dismissed all pending claims in thataction as moot.\n\n67. By virtue of the dismissal, the three-judge court in the D.C.action rejected the claim raised by the intervening Martinez plaintiffsthat the submission of the congressional plan by Governor Bush, SpeakerFeeney, and President McKay constituted a change in voting procedure thathad to be pre-cleared pursuant to section 5. This dismissal thereforeincludes the claim raised in count XV of the Martinez plaintiffs' secondamended complaint, and constitutes an adjudication of the issue ofwhether the submission by Governor Bush, Speaker Feeney, and PresidentMcKay was proper under section 5 and a finding that their submission wasproper.\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e11\u003c/span\u003e\n\n68. On June 20, 2002, the Department of Justice pre-cleared Florida'sState Senate redistricting plan.\n\n69. On July 1, 2002, the Department of Justice, by letter, interposedan objection to Florida's State House plan, concluding that proposed HD101 was retrogressive within the meaning of section 5 of the VotingRights Act. Due to this objection, we held an emergency evidentiaryhearing and issued an order adopting an interim State House plan that hadbeen proposed by Speaker Feeney. See Order Granting Speaker's Motion forEmergency Relief and Adopting Interim Remedial State House Plan [D.E.315]. We directed Secretary Harris to conduct the 2002 elections underthis interim remedial plan.\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e12\u003c/span\u003e\n\n5. THE REDISTRICTING PROCESSe\n\n70. Florida began the redistricting process in 2001. The legislatureprepared the technological groundwork for redistricting, held a series of24 public hearings throughout Florida, and then enacted redistrictinglegislation. During the 1991-1992 redistricting process, 33 publichearings and at least one statewide teleconference were held throughoutFlorida.\n\n71. Both the House and Senate established redistricting websites. Thesewebsites made the following information available to the public:\n\n• The names and districts of committee members for each of the redistricting committees.\n\n• Every plan submitted by any member of the legislature.\n\n• A committee and council meeting timeline, along with transcripts and meeting packets that were utilized in any of the meetings.\n\n• A public hearings timeline, with information about the specific locations and times of each of the public hearings to be held.\n\n• A public hearings archive including downloadable information following each of the public hearings.\n\n• The constitutional requirements for redistricting Florida's legislative districts under the Florida Constitution.\n\n• News and press releases regarding the redistricting process.\n\n• A \"Frequently Asked Questions\" (\"FAQ\") page with information regarding the 2000 census data.\n\n• Florida census data and a 54-page slide presentation providing an overview of Florida census data and trends.\n\n• Information on the FREDS 2000\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e13\u003c/span\u003e software, including: an order form, installation instructions, a dataset with Florida redistricting information to be integrated for use with the software, a downloadable update to the software, and a page dedicated to providing tutorial and other information to assist users of the software.\n\n• Information on how to contact the House and Senate Redistricting Committees and their staffs.\n\n72. The times and dates of the public hearings were advertised innewspapers, as well as listed on the redistricting websites, though thetiming of the announcements posted on the websites was not coordinatedwith the timing of the notices advertised in the media. The newspapers inwhich the public hearings were advertised are the Tallahassee Democrat,Florida Times-Union, Orlando Sentinel, Daytona News-Journal, TampaTribune, The Ledger, The Stuart News, Palm Beach Post, Sarasota HeraldTribune, Naples Daily News, Ft. Myers News Press, Miami Herald/El NuevoHerald, Ft. Lauderdale Sun Sentinel, Pensacola News Journal, and theGainesville Sun. Most of the newspaper advertisements were published only2-3 days before the scheduled public hearing.\n\n73. The websites provided hearing times and locations, as well as theprotocol and procedure for the hearings. The websites encouraged personsunable to attend the meetings to submit written testimony and plans tothe House or Senate Redistricting Committee, and also provided contactinformation so that members of the public could contact the committeeseither before or after the public hearings.\n\n74. The legislative leadership did not conduct any public meetings,workshops, or committee meetings to discuss the 2001 public hearingprocess or the selection of the hearing sites before the schedule waspresented to the public and Democratic members of the legislature.\n\n75. The public hearings took place between July 12, 2001, and October16, 2001, in Tallahassee (July 12 from 10:00 a.m. to 1:15 p.m.),Jacksonville (August 6 from 6:00 p.m. to 8:50 p.m.), Ocala (August 7 from1:30 p.m. to 4:30 p.m.), Orlando (August 20 from 6:00 p.m. to 11:05p.m.), Daytona Beach (August 21 from 10:00 a.m. to 12:45 p.m.), Tampa(August 27 from 9:30 a.m. to 1:35 p.m.), Clearwater (August 27 from 5:00p.m. to 7:05 p.m.), Lakeland (August 28 from 1:30 p.m. to 3:00 p.m.), VeroBeach (September 5 from 9:00 a.m. to 11:20 a.m.), West Palm Beach(September 5 from 4:00 p.m. to 6:40 p.m.), Defray Beach (September 6 from6:00 p.m. to 9:10 p.m.), Wachula (September 20 from 2:00 p.m. to 3:00p.m.), Sarasota (September 21 from 9:00 a.m. to 11:00 a.m.), LaBelle(September 24 at 10:00 am.), Naples (September 24 from 6:00 p.m. to 8:45p.m.), Ft. Myers (September 25 at 1:00 p.m.), Pembroke Pines (October 1 at9:00 a.m.), Ft. Lauderdale (October 1 at 5:00 p.m.), Miami (October 2 at4:00 p.m.), Miami (October 3 at 3:00 p.m.), Key Largo (October 3 at 10:00a.m.), Pensacola (October 15 at 6:00 p.m.), Panama City (October 16 at11:00 a.m.), and Gainesville (October 16 at 6:00 p.m.). Some citizens,including some minority citizens, were unaware of thehearings and/orwere unable to attend the hearings in their respective areas because ofthe time of the hearings. There were no official interpreters at thehearings, and no announcements about interpreters were posted prior tothe hearings, but some bilingual legislative staff members were availableat the sign-in table at some of the hearings (e.g., the hearings inMiami) to translate in Spanish or Creole if someone requestedassistance.\n\n76. After several requests of State Senator Debbie Wasserman-Schultz— a Democratic member of the legislature — a second publichearing was conducted in Broward County. The Republican leadership,however, rejected the requests of several Democratic legislators thatadditional hearings be held in the southern portion of Miami-DadeCounty.\n\n77. Only one public hearing was held in a predominantly black communityin Miami-Dade County. This hearing was held at Miami Central High Schoolon October 2, 2001, and began at 4:00 p.m.\n\n78. Only one public hearing, convened on October 3, 2001, at 3:00 p.m.at Florida International University, was held in a predominantly Hispaniccommunity in Miami-Dade County. Through Mayor Martinez, the City ofHialeah — which is predominantly Hispanic — offered to host apublic hearing free of charge, but no hearing was held in the city.\n\n79. Those public hearings that were held after 5:00 p.m. had thegreatest participation of blacks and Hispanics.\n\n80. Approximately 4,500 people attended the 24 public hearings in2001, three times the number of people that attended the 33 redistrictinghearings in 1991-1992. Over 1,000 people spoke at the 2001 publichearings, in contrast to the fewer than 400 people who spoke at the 1992hearings. In the 1991-1992 cycle, approximately 17 legislators attendedeach meeting; in the 2001-2002 cycle, approximately 26 legislatorsattended.\n\n81. The 2001 hearings consisted of an overview of the legal parametersof redistricting, a brief census overview outlining demographic facts insummary form, and public testimony, which included opportunities forlegislators to ask clarifying questions. The public, however, was notpermitted to pose questions to the legislators, and the legislators werenot allowed to ask the public substantive questions.\n\n82. The public hearing transcripts indicate that the appropriateprotocol for the hearings was followed, and that such protocol wasexplained to the public prior to the hearings.\n\n83 Following the public hearings, the redistricting committee websitesmade the following information available for downloading by the generalpublic (and, of course, any legislators): (1) either an audio or videorecording of the hearing; (2) a written transcript of the hearing; (3)the slide presentation made at the hearing; and (4) any public documentsmade available at the hearings and submissions (e.g., correspondence)from the public.\n\n84. In addition to the public hearings, hundreds of letters and e-mailcommunications were received from the public.\n\n6. THE FREDS REDISTRICTING SOFTWARE\n\n85. As part of its redistricting efforts, the Florida legislaturedeveloped the Florida Redistricting System or \"FREDS\" software, startingthe development process in late 1997 or the beginning of 1998.Development of FREDS was a joint House and Senate project coordinated byJohn Guthrie, Florida Senate StaffDirector for Systems Operations andTraining, and Todd Thomson, Florida House Staff Director of the HouseRedistricting Committee.\n\n86. Mr. Guthrie is a career public servant who has worked for theFlorida legislature for 14 years. For the past 13 years, Mr. Guthrie hasworked for the Florida Senate, under both Democratic and RepublicanSenate leadership. Additionally, Mr. Guthrie worked with the Martinezplaintiffs' counsel, Norman Powell, Esq., on behalf of the Democraticmajority in the 1991-1992 Florida redistricting, and worked with theMartinez plaintiffs' expert, Dr. Alan Lichtman, in defending Florida'sredistricting plans in 1994-1996.\n\n87. In 2001-2002, members of the legislature and the public had accessto redistricting information and technology through FREDS. No other statein the country provided affordable redistricting software for personalcomputers to the general public.\n\n88. The purpose of FREDS was to create a program for drawing andreviewing districting plans that would be easy to use by both thelegislature and the public. Though FREDS was initially intended as a toolfor the legislature in the redistricting process, it was recognized fromthe outset that FREDS could be made available to the public.\n\n89. FREDS contained data from the 1990 and 2000 censuses and Floridaelection results. The census data included population counts broken downby race, including voting-age population, and registration counts brokendown by party, gender, age, and race; the election data included actualelection results for Florida elections in 1992, 1994, 1996, 1998, and2000.\n\n90. In 2000, based upon census guidelines, citizens could self identifywith respect to race by choosing one or more of six options. Toaccommodate the 2000 census reporting options the United States Office ofManagement and Budget (\"0MB\") and the United States Department of Justice(\"DOJ\") issued guidelines with respect to allocation of minorities.Specifically, the DOJ guidelines set forth the allocation methodologyappropriate for civil rights enforcement. FREDS incorporated the federalallocation guidelines. In July of 2000, the allocation method utilized byFREDS was discussed with Joe Rich, Chief of the Voting Rights Section ofthe DOJ and received a \"positive\" reaction. Due to the use of the DOJ and0MB guidelines, FREDS did not have a separate category for \"Single-RaceBlack,\" though information for such a category was available in the 2000census. Instead, FREDS had the following population categories:\"Non-Hispanic Black;\" \"Hispanic Black;\" \"Hispanic;\" \"Single-Race White;\"and \"Other.\"\n\n91. FREDS uses a disaggregation method (an estimation technique) forapplying precinct data to census blocks. This disaggregation method usedby the legislature — which seeks to take information from a largergeographic level and import the character of that data to a smallergeographic level — is consistent with past practice, and is anappropriate method for applying election results to census blocks inFlorida.\n\n92. A potential alternative method for applying voter registrationcounts to census blocks is known as geocoding. Geocoding involves the useof voter registration data, which includes address information, from theFlorida central voter files, to match voters with their addresses andplace them within census blocks. A state employee attempted to geocode thecentral voter file, but he did not know the particulars of which countyor counties were selected and what methods were used. Mr. Guthrie askedFlorida's Office of Demographic and Economic Research (\"ODER\") to attemptto geocode the election information to the census block level. The ODERreported, however, that it was unable to geocode \"15 to 20 percent of thevoters\" to their census blocks. Mr. Guthrie therefore decided to use thedisaggregation method.\n\n93. In order to disaggregate election information from the precinctlevel to the census block level, the FREDS development team relied uponan assumption of homogenous distribution of population for every censuscategory within a census block.\n\n94. The FREDS development team did not develop or have an understandingof what the margin of error was for the assumption of homogenous censusgeography relied upon in developing FREDS.\n\n95. The Martinez plaintiffs' second expert, Dr. Gerald Webster,testified in his deposition that it was not possible to geocode thedata. There is no testimony by the Martinez plaintiffs' expertssuggesting that disaggregation is not an appropriate methodology. Infact, some of the Martinez plaintiffs' experts used the district levelestimates derived using the FREDS disaggregation method.\n\n96. On July 12, 2001, a beta version of FREDS was released to membersof the legislature, as well as to the public, for full scale testing.This initial release revealed that FREDS was incompatible with olderversions of Microsoft Internet Explorer. FREDS, for example, crashed theCity of Hialeah's computer. The necessary Internet Explorer update,however, was available at no cost on the Microsoft website long beforethe July 12, 2001, beta release of FREDS. In any event, the problem wasdiagnosed within hours of the release of FREDS, and the method ofresolving it was publicized by posting the information on theredistricting websites and directly calling the 20 or so members of thepublic that had purchased FREDS at that time.\n\n97. The FREDS software costs $20, in contrast to commercially availableprograms that could be used to draw district lines, such as Maptitude,which costs $3,500 and requires additional expenditures before it can beused for redistricting.\n\n98. Despite its low cost, less than 300 people purchased the FREDSsoftware.\n\n99. The computer requirements for running FREDS are not substantial. Atthe time of trial, a computer with capabilities exceeding therequirements for running FREDS — a Windows 98 or higher operatingsystem, a 300 megahertz or higher processor, and RAM of 64 megabytes orhigher — could be purchased for less than $500.\n\n100. In addition to selling the software for $20, FREDS was madeavailable to the public through distribution to 508 public librariesacross the state of Florida, 28 depository libraries, every public andprivate college library, and supervisors of elections in each county.FREDS was also available at no cost on the redistricting websites.\n\n101. Training on how to use FREDS was made available in a variety ofways. After it was suggested that training be provided at the August 27,2001, public hearing in Clearwater, assistance and training wereavailable at each public hearing from that date forward for about an hourprior to the start of the hearing. These were not formal training sessionsor classes, however, and consisted of Mr. Guthrie and others answeringthe questions of citizens who dropped by. The software package includes a138-page help manual and a tutorial. This manual wasavailable for viewing and downloading on the redistricting websites.\n\n102. None of the traditional methods of contacting one's legislatorwere curtailed or affected by FREDS or the redistricting process used bythe legislature. Accordingly, any Floridian with concerns aboutredistricting was able to visit, telephone, and write to his or herlegislator, in addition to the additional methods provided through thedistribution of FREDS, the public hearings, and the establishment of theHouse and Senate redistricting websites.\n\n7. THE REDISTRICTING PLANS\n\n103. The legislature reached out to specific voting rights and publicinterest groups. On December 21, 2001, Representative Johnnie B. Byrd,Jr., Chairman of the House Procedural and Redistricting Council, sent aletter to the Florida Democratic and Republican Parties, Common Cause,the Florida State Conference of NAACP Branches, the Florida League ofWomen Voters (both statewide and the Tallahassee chapter), and theAmerican Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees. In theletter, Chairman Byrd invited these organizations to participate in theredistricting process:\n\nIn the continuing spirit of having the most fair and open redistricting in Florida's history I would like to personally invite you to our redistricting committee meetings on January 7, 2002 to present your view on the maps that have been proposed thus far and offer any redistricting plans or ideas that your organization has developed. These committee meetings will serve as yet another opportunity for the public to have their voice heard on redistricting matters.\n\n104. On January 7, 2002, the Florida State Conference of NAACP Branches(\"NAACP\") responded to Chairman Byrd's letter with a memorandum to theHouse Redistricting Committee, noting that while the \"NAACP usuallyincludes alternative redistricting plans\" when it presents analysis ofredistricting plans being considered by state and local jurisdictions, itwas \"not necessary\" to do so at that point in Florida's redistrictingprocess, based on the plans already proposed.\n\n105. The NAACP further observed that \"Florida has done a better jobthan many states\" in its endeavor to comply with section 2 of the VotingRights Act. The letter also provided the NAACP's analysis of plans underconsideration at that time.\n\n106. On January 22, 2002, Representative Mario Diaz-Balart, Chairman ofthe House Congressional Redistricting Committee, sent another letter tothe NAACP, thanking it for the memorandum and inviting NAACPparticipation in a committee meeting to workshop and discuss thememorandum.\n\n107. There were four House committees that were responsible fordrafting and approving the House legislative and congressional plans forfull chambers consideration. These were the House Procedural andRedistricting Council (\"Procedural\"), House Congressional RedistrictingCommittee (\"Congressional\"), House Redistricting Committee (\"House\"), andSenate Redistricting Committee (\"Senate\") (collectively the \"HouseCommittees\"). Speaker Feeney appointed each member of the HouseCommittees and each of those committees had at least a majority ofRepublicans. The partisan break down for each House Committee was asfollows: Procedural (13 Republicans and 6 Democrats); House (6Republicans and 3 Democrats); and Senate (4 Republicans and 3Democrats). No Democrat chaired or co-chaired a House Committee. Noamendment to the House Committee maps that was introduced by a Democraticcommittee member or member of the House was ever adopted. No Democraticmember's amendment was ever adopted during the House floor debate on thecommittees' maps.\n\n108. In total, the House Committees (e.g., House, Senate, andCongressional) held 16 meetings between October of 2001 and February of2002 to discuss the concepts being presented by various plans and anyamendments that had been filed.\n\n109. During this time, the legislative leadership announced that thestaff of the redistricting committees was available to assist any memberof the legislature in understanding demographic, legal, or other relevantissues. All members were encouraged to engage in the process by filingplans and plan amendments, and to utilize the committee staff. Each of theplans filed was posted on the Internet and available for public review andcomment.\n\n110. There were few maps proposed by the public that were sponsored bylegislative members.\n\n111. Proposed congressional and state redistricting plans were filedfor consideration by Representative William F. Andrews (H087H001 andH087H002); Representative Anna Holliday Benson (H003H001 and H003H002);Representative Phillip J. Brutus (H108H001 and H108H002); RepresentativeByrd, Jr. (H062H001, H062S001, and H062C002); Representative Larry Crow(H049H001 and H049H002); Representative Nancy Detert (H070H002 andH070H004); Representative Greg Evers (H001H001); Representative FrankFarkas (H052C001, H052H001 and H052H002); Representative Andy Gardiner(H040C001 and H040H001); Representative James Harper, Jr. (H084H001);Representative Mike Hogan (H013C001 and H013H003); Representative Lerner(H119H001); Representative Will Kendrick (H010H003 and H010H005);Representative Bev Kilmer (H007H001); Representative Jeffrey D. Kottkamp(H074H001); Representative Mitch Needelman (H031H003 and H031H005);Representative Joe Negron (H082H003); Representative Joe H. Pickens(H021H002); Representative Marco Rubio (H111H001, H111H003, andH111S001); Representative Timothy M. Ryan (H099H001, H099H002, andH099S001); Representative David Simmons (H037H002); Representative JosephR. Spratt (H077H004); Representative Rob Wallace (H047H001 andH047S001); Senator Alex Diaz de la Portilla (534500017 and S34S00031);Senator Holzendorf (S02S0010, S02S00012, S02S00019, S02S00025,S02S00028, and S02S00035); Senator Bill Posey (S15S0002 and S15S00030);Senator Charlie Clary (S07S00033 and S07S00034); Senator Daniel Webster(S12S00027); Senator Wasserman-Schultz (S32S0008); Senator John F.Laurent (S17S0001, S17S0003, S17S0005, S17S0006, S17S0009, S17S00011,S17S00016, S17S00022, S17S00023, S17S00024, S17S00026, S17S00032, andS17S00036); Senator Steven A. Geller (S29S0007, S29S00013, S29S00014,S29S00015, S29S00018, S29S00020, S29S00021, and S29S00029);Representative Edward L. Jennings, Jr. (H023S001); Representative DavidD. Russell, Jr. (H0445001); Representative Bruce Kyle (H073S0001);Representative Christopher L. Smith (H093C001 and H0935001); Senator JackLatvala (S19C0004, S19C0005, S19C0010, S19C0011, S19C0015, S19C0016,S19C0017); Senator Daryl L. Jones (S40C0006 and S40C0012); Senator BurtL. Saunders (S25C0007); Senator Walter G. Campbell (S33C0009); SenatorGinny Brown-Waite (S10C0013); Senator Lesley Miller, Jr. (S21C0014);Representative J. Dudley Goodlette (H076C001); Representative Meadows(H094C001 and H094C002); Representative Diaz-Balart (H112C001 H112C002,H112C003, and H112C004).\n\n112. Representative Lerner, a Democrat, drafted and participated insubmitting an alternative house plan to the legislature that kept formerHD 119 relatively unchanged. She withdrew the plan, however, because shewas satisfied with the plan submitted by Representative Ryan.\n\n113. The redistricting proceedings in the Senate mirrored the Houseproceedings, with one exception. The Senate did not draw a Senatelegislative House plan. Instead, the Senate informed the House that itwas not going to draw House districts, and the Senate expected that theHouse would not draw Senate districts. As noted above, however, the Housedrew a Senate map.\n\n114. Three Senate committees were primarily responsible for draftingand approving the Senate legislative and congressional plans for fullchambers consideration: Senate Committee on Reapportionment (\"SenateReapportionment\"), Senate Reapportionment Subcommittee on CongressionalApportionment and Redistricting (\"Senate Congressional\"), and SenateReapportionment Subcommittee on Legislative Apportionment andRedistricting (\"Senate Legislative\") (collectively \"Senate Committees\").President McKay appointed each member of the Senate Committees.Republicans constituted at least a majority of the membership of each ofthe Senate Committees. As in the House, no amendment introduced by aDemocratic committee member was adopted in committee or on the Senatefloor.\n\n115. Although the Senate Committees did not conduct simultaneousmeetings, the Senate Legislative Committee cancelled three consecutivemeetings, on February 28, 2002, March 7, 2002, and March 8, 2002. TheSenate Legislative Committee did not post the final maps it wouldconsider until after midnight on the morning of the Senate LegislativeCommittee meeting of March 12, 2002.\n\n116. At the March 12, 2002 Senate Legislative Committee Meeting, theChair of the Committee voted against the committee's map and voiced hisconcern that the public had not received adequate notice and anopportunity to consider the committee's proposed maps. Chairman Websteralso voiced his concerns that the start time did not allow constituentsenough time to contact the individual senators regarding any concernsthey may have with the maps:\n\nI think we told the public that we would have these things posted as soon as we could on the Internet and that people could look at them. And if they had questions, they could either call their members or call us or write us, or do something, get in touch with us in a way that would allow us to respond to whatever it is that they had a concern about. And that didn't happen this time, and so I guess for me, it is just a statement to say, I'm voting no because I feel like the public didn't have enough time on this particular issue. If you have a conscience that's bothering you, then I guess you could join me, but I'm not asking that. I'm just saying mine did, because I'm the one that made the statements, I'm the one that defended the Senate, I'm the one that said we would have an open and an inclusive and a fair process. And I felt like in this one step, we did not.\n\n117. Despite Chairman Webster's concerns, the proposed SenateLegislative Committee bill was eventually approved.\n\n118. Public testimony was also presented to the Senate LegislativeCommittee at the March 12, 2002 meeting that questioned the Committee'scancellation of its meetings and the adverse effect the cancellations hadon the public's ability to participate. For example, the RepublicanChairman of Marion County made the following statement:\n\nIt is a shame, however, that the public has to be put through what they have had to be put through to get to this point.\n\nMany times, the meetings have been canceled and rescheduled and canceled and rescheduled. The public in many cases has given up on trying to even come and testify any longer. But it is sad process.\n\n119. In total, the Senate Redistricting Committees held seven meetingsbetween January 7, 2002 and March 12, 2002 to discuss the formulation ofredistricting plans.\n\n120. Disputes between Speaker Feeney and President McKay led to delaysin the redistricting process.\n\n121. When Speaker Feeney and President McKay reached a last-minuteresolution of their dispute, the legislature did not refer the Senate'sproposed Senate map to a House Committee or otherwise consider the map onthe House floor. The Senate also did not refer the House proposed versionof the legislative House map to a Senate committee or otherwise considerthe House legislative districts.\n\n122. Once the Senate adopted the Senate legislative map and substitutedthe same in the House proposed resolution (HJR 1987) for the Senate map,the House considered the revised resolution as a message from the Senateon a motion of Representative Goodlette, a Republican. Thereafter,Republican Representative Byrd moved that the House concur in SenateAmendment 3 under House Rule 12.6(a)(2). Prior to any debate, questions,or discussion of the Senate amendment, Representative Rubio, aRepublican, moved the previous question on the motion to concur in theSenate amendment. The motion passed 74-43. All Democrats present votedno. Two Republicans also voted no. Under House Rule 11.8, a motion forthe previous question is not debatable and a majority vote will end alldebate, except that the sponsor and opponent of the bill are allowedthree minutes of debate each. The proponent and opponent are also allowedto yield time to other members. In this case, Speaker Feeney selected twoRepublicans to debate the resolution, Representative Kyle andRepresentative Byrd. All debate on the resolution, therefore, was limitedto two Republican members and no Democrat was afforded an opportunity todebate. A final vote was taken on the motion to concur in the Senateamendment, which passed 73-43. All Democrats voted no along withRepresentative Kyle.\n\n123. The Republican-controlled legislature intended to maximize thenumber of Republican congressional and legislative seats through theredistricting process, and used its majority power to control the typesof bills and maps that would be considered in the House and Senate.\n\n124. One of the most complicated and significant issues the legislaturefaced was the result of the need to create an additional congressionaldistrict in south Florida — one of the two additional districts towhich Florida was entitled as a result of the 2000 census —combined with the slow growth and under-population in several of theexisting south Florida congressional districts (e.g., old CD 17). Thisproblem was specifically addressed during the House floor debate onproposed congressional plans. As RepresentativeDiaz-Balart put it: \"Therewere significant changes in other south Florida districts largely due,Mr. Speaker, to the creation of the new district [CD 25], and also due tothe slow growth in Districts 17, 18, 22, and 23 that required additionalareas to be added to these districts.\"\n\nC. ULTIMATE FINDINGS ON THE \"PROCESS\" CLAIMS\n\nWe find that the Martinez plaintiffs have failed to carry their burdenof showing intentional discrimination against blacks, Hispanics, or anyother minority groups on their \"process\" claims.\n\nThe Martinez plaintiffs contend that the Republican legislativeleadership did not follow customary legislative protocol in devisingFlorida's public hearing schedule. In particular, they claim that nopublic meetings or legislative committee discussions were held concerningthe proposed hearings or for the receipt of public input concerning theredistricting process. Furthermore, they point out, when the hearingschedule was presented to the Democratic members of the legislature andthe public, the legislative leadership refused to answer questionsregarding the selection of the hearing locations and start times. Inshort, the Martinez plaintiffs claim that all decisions regarding theredistricting hearing process were predetermined or made behind closeddoors, and that the plans were therefore drawn devoid of public input andscrutiny.\n\nThe Martinez plaintiffs also assert that the public hearing process hada disproportionate impact on the state's blacks and other minorities.They maintain that these groups traditionally hold jobs that requiredaily attendance during working hours, and that 18 of the 24 hearingswere held at some point during the day between normal business hours. Incontrast, only four public hearings began after 6:00 p.m. They furtherargue that the public hearing schedule avoided high population citieswhere the vast majority of Florida's black and minority communitiesreside. Only one hearing was held in a predominately black community, andonly one hearing conducted in a predominately Hispanic community.Moreover, the Martinez plaintiffs say that the notices that were providedto the public were inadequate and frequently provided too close in timeto the meeting dates to provide the public with an opportunity to arrangefor their participation.\n\nAt a general level, we share some of the concerns articulated by theMartinez plaintiffs in their \"process\" claims. First, although theRepublican leadership of the legislature did not prevent anyone frompresenting their views on redistricting, held numerous hearings throughoutthe state on redistricting which large numbers of people attended, andcreated a software program — FREDS — that was economical andavailable to the public, it appears that the leadership also wanted tolimit the actual substantive debate on the merits of the various plansthat were proposed, and did not much care about input from the Democraticminority or the public on the redistricting process or the plansthemselves. This raw exercise of majority legislative power does not seemto be the best way of conducting a critical task like redistricting, butit does seem to be an unfortunate fact of political life around thecountry. Second, as the Martinez plaintiffs point out, it might have beenpreferable to provide more than two to five days' notice in newspapers tothe public about upcoming hearings rather than rely on internetwebsites.\n\nOther concerns voiced by the Martinez plaintiffs, however, are notwell-founded. For example, the claim that choosing FREDS over otheravailable redistricting software was somehow discriminatory ishollow. FREDS was much less expensive than Maptitude and therefore moreaccessible to the public. Similarly, the allocation of minority groups inFREDS was not motivated by any racial animus, as that allocation wasbased on a methodology that was consistent with DOJ and OMB guidelines.Finally, the use of a disaggregation method over geocoding was notdiscriminatory in any way.\n\nIn any event, our role is not to determine whether the proceduralchoices made by the legislature were the best among a range of options,whether the legislative action had to reflect the testimony received atthe public hearings, or whether the legislature was required to considerthat testimony or input during its redistricting deliberations.\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e14\u003c/span\u003e Ourtask, instead, is to determine whether the legislature's actions violatedfederal law, and our finding is they did not. The Martinez plaintiffsfailed to present any evidence to show that the defendants were motivatedby discrimination against blacks or Hispanics in deciding whatredistricting software or allocation methodology to use, where to holdthe public hearings, when to hold public hearings, what type of notice toprovide, or whether to consider input from Florida citizens and Democraticlegislators in drawing the redistricting plans.\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e15\u003c/span\u003e\n\nII. VOTE DILUTION BASED ON RACE\n\nAfter having addressed plaintiffs' process claims, we now turn to theallegations of racial vote dilution. For purposes of this litigation, theparties do not dispute that section 2 requires the creation of performingminority districts and that the number created by the Florida legislatureis sufficient to satisfy that obligation. Rather, the plaintiffs claimthat the reapportionment plan used by the Florida legislature results inthe dilution of black voting power,\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e16\u003c/span\u003e and hence a violation of theVoting Rights Act, because the newly drawn performing districts areeither not sufficiently likely to perform or are excessively packed so asto \"waste\" minority votes.\n\nTo evaluate these allegations concerning the composition of theperforming minority districts — a necessarily fact-intensive inquiry— the bulk of this part is dedicated to setting forth our findingsof fact with respect to racial voting behavior, the Florida redistrictingprocess, and the makeup and voting history of each of the challengeddistricts. In subpart II.B. below, we conclude that the evidence does notsupport a finding that the strength of black voters will be negativelyimpacted by the reapportionment. The evidence suggests that blackcandidates of choice will prevail in a very high percentage of electionsin the challenged districts and that none of the districts areimpermissibly stacked.\n\nA. FINDINGS OF FACT\n\n1. GENERAL FINDINGS: VOTING BEHAVIOR BY RACE\n\n125. There is a substantial degree of racially polarized voting insouth Floridaand northeast Florida — the areas of the stateinvolved in plaintiffs' claims of racial vote dilution. A substantialmajority of black voters in these areas sometimes favors candidates thatmost other voters do not favor. A substantial majority of non-blackvoters sometimes opposes black candidates of choice.\n\n126. In any district in these areas in which blacks do not comprise amajority or near majority of actual voters, it is likely that the blackcandidate of choice (if different from the candidate of choice ofnon-black voters) will not often prevail; instead, the candidate ofchoice of non-black voters will prevail. Black candidates of choice oftenwill prevail, however, in a district in which blacks comprise a nearmajority of actual voters, even when they do not comprise a majority,because a significant number of non-black voters support black candidatesof choice.\n\n127. Voting behavior by race for any district in these geographic areascannot be projected with certainty. The most constant characteristic ofthe Florida population is that it constantly changes; voters in anydistrict come and go. This is especially so in south Florida. By the timeof the 2002 elections, the demographics of any district will differ fromthose reflected in the 2000 census. By 2008 or 2010, the differences willbe substantial. Projections of 2002 election outcomes based on 2000census data are uncertain. Projections of 2008 or 2010 election outcomesbased on 2000 census data are even more uncertain.\n\n128. Projections based on prior voting behavior also are uncertain.Although voting turnout and preference by race for the geographic areacovered by a district can reasonably be estimated for prior elections,the movement of voters into and out of the area necessarily means theprior votes were cast by a different set of voters than will vote in anyfuture election. And even those voters who stay in a district do notalways vote as they did previously.\n\n129. More fundamentally, neither voters nor candidates are fungible,whether within or without the same racial or ethnic groups. Turnout andvoter preference vary not only with such factors as the type of electionand race of the candidates, but also with overall political trends andwith the particular issues and candidates involved in a particularelection.\n\n130. For the districts at issue in this case, it is impossible toproject with certainty the voter turnout and preference by race that willoccur during the coming decade.\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e17\u003c/span\u003e Nonetheless, reasonable projectionscan be made. In making suchprojections, all relevant circumstances anddata properly are considered; no one type of analysis or set of data issufficiently reliable to justify its use standing alone. Bothdemographics and past voting performance are relevant.\n\n2. CONGRESSIONAL PLAN\n\na. BACKGROUND\n\n131. During each recent decade, Florida's population has grownsubstantially, resulting in an increase in Florida's number ofrepresentatives in the United States House of Representatives.\n\n132. As a result of the 1990 census, Florida's number ofrepresentatives increased from 19 to 23. The Florida legislature wasunable to agree on an apportionment plan. Florida law provided no methodfor adopting a plan in the absence of action by the Florida legislature.Because of increases and shifts in population, the preexisting plan asadopted in 1982 was malapportioned, in violation of the one person, onevote principle. Litigation in the United States District Court for theNorthern District of Florida led to the implementation of a plan drawn bya court-appointed expert based on the litigants' submissions.\n\n133. The court-drawn plan included three districts (numbered 3, 17, and23) that were projected to perform for a black candidate of choice andtwo districts (numbered 18 and 21) that were projected to perform for anHispanic candidate of choice. Districts that are projected to perform forminority candidates of choice are sometimes referred to in this order as\"minority districts.\"\n\n134. Each of these five minority districts performed as anticipated. In1992, voters elected Corrine Brown (in CD 3), Carrie Meek (in CD 17), andAlcee Hastings (in CD 23), each of whom is black, and Ileana Ros-Lehtinen(in CD 18) and Lincoln Diaz-Balart (in CD 21), each of whom is Hispanic.Each was the candidate of choice of the relevant minority in thedistrict. Each was reelected in 1994, 1996,\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e18\u003c/span\u003e 1998, and 2000, andcontinues to serve.\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e19\u003c/span\u003e\n\n135. As a result of the 2000 census, Florida's number ofrepresentatives in the United States House of Representatives increasedfrom 23 to 25. The Florida legislature was controlled by a substantialRepublican majority in each house. The legislature adopted acongressional reapportionment plan on March 22, 2002, with 25 singlemember districts. Governor Bush, also a Republican, signed the plan intolaw on March 27, 2002.\n\nb. ULTIMATE FINDINGS\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e20\u003c/span\u003e\n\n136. The legislature's overriding goal with respect to congressionalreapportionment was to adopt a plan that would withstand legal challengesand would maximize the number of districts likely to perform forRepublicans. The legislature had no purpose to discriminate against blackor Hispanic candidates or voters. To the contrary, the legislatureaffirmatively intended not to discriminate against black or Hispaniccandidates or voters. The legislature recognized that adopting districtsthat would not dilute black or Hispanic voting strength was fullyconsistent with — perhaps even essential to — the goal ofadopting a plan that would withstand legal challenges.\n\n137. The legislature's plan included three districts (still numbered3, 17, and 23) intended to perform for black candidates of choice.\n\n138. It is likely that CDs 3, 17, and 23 will in fact perform for blackcandidates of choice, and that black candidates of choice will be electedin these districts throughout the coming decade.\n\n139. The legislature determined, correctly, that increases in theHispanic population made it feasible to draw a third reasonably compactdistrict that would perform for Hispanic candidates of choice. Thelegislature's plan included three districts (two still numbered 18 and 21and a new district numbered 25) intended to perform for Hispaniccandidates of choice.\n\n140. It is likely that CDs 18, 21, and 25 will in fact perform forHispanic candidates of choice, and that Hispanic candidates of choicewill be elected in these districts throughout the coming decade.\n\n141. Race was considered in the drawing of CDs 3, 17, and 23, andHispanic status was considered in the drawing of CDs 18, 21, and 25, inan effort to enhance performance of the districts for black or Hispaniccandidates of choice, to avoid dilution of the votes of black or Hispanicvoters, and to comply with section 2 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965.Traditional districting principles also were considered and respected inthe drawing of these districts. No effort was made to afford blacks orHispanics substantially greater than proportional representation or toafford them representation inconsistent with traditional districtingprinciples. Neither race nor Hispanic status was the controlling orpredominant factor in the drawing of such districts.\n\n142. CDs 3, 17, 23, 18, 21, and 25 are reasonably compact.\n\n143. CDs 3, 17, 23, 18, 21, and 25 in fact comply to a reasonableextent with traditional districting principles.\n\n144. No greater number of reasonably compact performing minoritydistricts reasonably could have been drawn.\n\nc. CENSUS DATA\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e21\u003c/span\u003e\n\n145. The 1990 census included as a racial category \"Black or Negro.\"The 2000 census included as a racial category \"Black, African Am. orNegro.\" In this order, we use \"black\" as shorthand for this category. Seesupra note 2.\n\n146. In the 2000 census, respondents were required to self identify asat least one race; they were free to self identify as more than onerace. Various races (including \"White,\" \"Black, African Am., or Negro,\"\"American Indian or Alaska Native,\" and various Asian nationalities) werelisted, as was a category \"Some other race — Print race.\" In the1990 census, respondents were required to self identify as one and onlyone race; various races (substantively the same as for 2000) werelisted, as was a category \"Other race (Print race).\" In both the 1990 and2000 censuses, race was a wholly separate category from Hispanic status;regardless of a respondent's racial self-identification, the respondentwas required to self identify as either Hispanic or not Hispanic.\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e22\u003c/span\u003e\n\n147. It is likely that some individuals who identified themselves asboth black and another race in 2000 identified themselves in the singlecategory black in 1990. It also is likely that some individuals whoidentified themselves as both black and another race in 2000 did notidentify themselves as black in 1990 but instead listed themselves asanother race or as \"Other race.\" So far as this record reflects or we areaware, there are no reliable studies of the effect of the change from the1990 single race response requirement to the 2000 allowance of multiplerace responses. It is unlikely that the change materially affects theanalysis relevant to this case, because the number of persons counted asblack under the 2000 methodology who would not be counted as black underthe 1990 methodology probably is small. The discrimination of primaryconcern for present purposes is discrimination (that is, vote dilution)against blacks; it seems unlikely that such discrimination would bedirected to single race blacks but not multi-race blacks, or viceversa.\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e23\u003c/span\u003e\n\nd. CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT 23\n\n148. According to the 2000 census, the non-Hispanic black population ofnew CD 23 was 54.6%, and the Hispanic black population was 1%, for atotal black population of 55.6%. The non-Hispanic black voting agepopulation was 49.3%, and the Hispanic black voting age population was0.8%, for a total black voting age population of 50.1%.\n\n149. Voting age population, not total population, is relevant toassessing potential voting strength as of 2000, but some of those whowere underage in 2000 already have come of age, and others of course willdo so in ensuing years. Other things being equal, the 50.1% black votingage population will increase during the coming decade.\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e24\u003c/span\u003e\n\n150. Even with only a 50.1% black voting age population, the districtwill afford black voters a reasonable opportunity to elect candidates ofchoice and probably will in fact perform for black candidates of choice.\n\n151. This is so in part because, according to 2000 data, blacksconstitute 59.2% of registered Democrats in new CD 23, and Democratsconstitute 65.0% of registered voters. Republicans constitute only 19.5%of registered voters. Actual voting also is overwhelmingly Democratic; inthe 2000 presidential election, voters in new CD 23 voted 78.5% forDemocratic candidate Al Gore and 19.9% for Republican candidate GeorgeW. Bush. The black candidate of choice is likely to win a contestedDemocratic primary, and the Democratic nominee is likely to win thegeneral election.\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e25\u003c/span\u003e\n\n152. The history of prior CD 23 — which had different boundariesbut the same core and similar demographics as new CD 23 — suggeststhat a 55.6% total black population and 50.1% black voting age populationare sufficient to cause the district to perform for black candidates ofchoice. When first drawn in 1992,\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e26\u003c/span\u003e prior CD 23 had (according to the1990 census) a non-Hispanic black population of 50.2%, Hispanic blackpopulation of 1.5%, and total black population of 51.7%, nearly fourpercentage points lower than the total black population of newly createdCD 23 under the 2000 census. Similarly, when first drawn in 1992, priorCD 23 had (according to the 1990 census) a non-Hispanic black voting agepopulation of 44.4%, Hispanic black voting age population of 1.4%, andtotal black voting age population of 45.8%, more than four points lowerthan new CD 23 has under the 2000 census.\n\n153. The black percentage of total population in prior CD 23 increasedthroughout the decade of the 1990s, as did the black percentage of votingage population. By the time of the 2000 census, prior CD 23 had blacktotal population of 58.7% and black voting age population of 53.9%— higher than new CD 23 — but there is no reason to believethat percentages that high were necessary for the district to perform forblack candidates of choice.\n\n154. Prior CD 23 performed for the black candidate of choice in everyelection from 1992 through 2000. New CD 23 has demographics morefavorable to black candidates of choice than did prior CD 23 when it wascreated. The demographics of new CD 23 are likely to become morefavorable for black candidates of choice as time passes, just as occurredin prior CD 23. There is no reason to believe racial polarization haschanged materially since 1992. There is no reason to believe that new CD23 will perform less favorably for black candidates of choice in thecoming decade than did old CD 23 in the prior decade.\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e27\u003c/span\u003e\n\n155. Techniques of ecological regression and projection of futurevoting behavior that are reasonably reliable and accepted in the field ofpolitical science support the conclusion that CD 23 will perform for blackcandidates of choice. Such techniques require choosing past elections onwhich ecological regression is performed and making assumptions andchoosing data sets for use in projecting the results of futureelections. There is no single reliable or accepted approach for choosingpast elections or choosing data sets for projecting future elections. Theparties' experts have performed their analyses using various pastelections and various assumptions and data sets for projecting futureelections; they could have performed the analysis in many additional waysas well. No purpose would be served by addressing all the analyses thathave been or could be done for CD 23. We address only so much of theanalysis as necessary to explain why, even if plaintiffs' data areaccepted, it is still clear that CD 23 can be expected to perform forblack candidates of choice.\n\n156. There have been two changes in Florida law in the last decade thataffect the analysis. First, in elections prior to and during 1998,political party primaries always were \"closed,\" that is, only registeredmembers of a political party could vote in that party's primaries.Effective January 5, 1999, the Florida Constitution was amended toprovide that, when the only candidates for an office are from the sameparty, so that that party's nominee will have no opposition in the generalelection, the party's primary is \"open,\" that is, all voters mayparticipate in the primary, regardless of party registration.\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e28\u003c/span\u003e TheFlorida Secretary of State has interpreted this provision to mean that aprimary is \"open\" only if there are no other candidates who have qualifiedto have their names on the general election ballot and also no qualifiedwrite-in candidates.\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e29\u003c/span\u003e The interpretation of the Secretary of Statehas not, so far as we are aware, been challenged; it has been followed inall elections since the \"open primary\" provision was adopted. Nor, so faras we are aware, has the Florida \"open primary\" provision beenchallenged.\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e30\u003c/span\u003e\n\n157. The second change in Florida law occurred in 2001. Prior to thattime, there was a \"majority vote requirement\" in party primaries. If nocandidate received a majority of the votes in a primary, there was a\"runoff\" or \"second primary\" between the two candidates who received thehighest number of votes in the first primary. In 2001, the Floridalegislature eliminated the majority vote requirement; there is now asingle primary, with the candidate who receives the most votes, even ifless than a majority, advancing to the general election. The newprovision sunsets, however, on January 1, 2004. After that date, therewill again be a majority vote requirement, unless the legislature takesaction to the contrary.\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e31\u003c/span\u003e\n\n158. It is clear that, in a closed Democratic primary in which only asingle candidate has substantial support among black voters, CD 23 islikely to perform for that candidate, as against a single opposingcandidate or indeed as against all comers. The parties' analysesconsistently have projected a vote in excess of 50% for the blackcandidate of choice in such an election. Plaintiffs have presented noprojections to the contrary. Further, the likelihood is overwhelming thatthe Democratic primary winner will prevail in any general election;plaintiffs concede as much.\n\n159. The virtually uncontested findings set forth in paragraph 158,without more, make it likely that CD 23 will perform for black candidatesof choice, because if ever the ability of CD 23 to elect a blackcandidate of choice is in jeopardy, it is likely that the Democraticprimary will be closed (see infra paragraph 160), and it is likely thatthere will be a single candidate with substantial support among blackvoters (see infra paragraphs 161-162).\n\n160. There have been 115 congressional elections in Florida sinceadoption of the 1992 congressional reapportionment plan — five ineach of the 23 districts. Only two of those 115 elections would have hadan \"open\" primary if the new Florida open primary provision had been ineffect. Both were Republican primaries, one in 1992 and one in 1994.Thus, the conditions that would lead to an open Democratic primary havenot occurred in at least a decade. The likelihood that any Democraticprimary in any district will be \"open\" in the next decade is small.Moreover, it is likely that, in any election in which the ability of CD23 to elect a black candidate of choice is in jeopardy because of thepossibility that the primary will be open, a write-in candidate willqualify for the general election, thus closing the primary.\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e32\u003c/span\u003e\n\n161. It is possible that in a given Democratic primary election in CD23, there could be two or more candidates with substantial support amongblack voters. It is possible that, even though such candidates incombination would receive a majority of all votes cast in the primary,another candidate would win the primary, because of the elimination ofthe majority vote requirement. It is likely, however, that in anyelection in which the ability of CD 23 to elect a black candidate ofchoice would be in jeopardy for this reason, a single candidate favoredby the black community would emerge, either as a result of withdrawal ofcompeting candidates with support in the black community, or bycoalescence of black voters behind the single candidate. Even if that didnot occur, this would indicate not that black voters had not had areasonable opportunity to elect a candidate of their choice, but onlythat, in a particular instance, that opportunity was not realized.\n\n162. In any event, elimination of the majority vote requirement canmake a difference only if there are three or more candidates in theprimary. The possibility is more theoretical than real that there will beany such election in CD 23 prior to reinstatement of the majority voterequirement. Mr. Hastings, the incumbent, has drawn no primary oppositionat all since 1992. The possibility that in 2002 there would be threecandidates in the Democratic primary — including a candidate inaddition to Mr. Hastings who has substantial support in the blackcommunity — was remote. The majority vote requirement will returnin 2004 unless the legislature takes action to the contrary.\n\n163. Even the analysis most favorable to plaintiffs fails to underminethe conclusion that CD 23 is likely to perform for black candidates ofchoice. Plaintiffs posit that if there is an open Democratic primary withRepublicans and independents voting, and if the turnout of black votersas a percentage of overall voters is only the same as in the 1998 generalelection, and if black voters are only as cohesive as in a mix oflow-visibility, sometimes non-partisan elections, and if there is noincumbency effect, then a black candidate of choice would poll only 48.0%of the vote, and thus would lose. See Pl. Exh. 81-C at 5, Table 3. Infact, however, if the ability of CD 23 to elect a black candidate ofchoice is in jeopardy, there is not likely to be an open primary,\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e33\u003c/span\u003eblack turnout relative to non-black turnout may well increase,\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e34\u003c/span\u003e andblack cohesiveness may well be higher than plaintiffs suggest.\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e35\u003c/span\u003eThus, evenwithout an incumbent, the projection of a 48.0% vote for ablack candidate of choice is unrealistically low. That the projected votecomes this close to a majority, even on these assumptions, is fullyconsistent with the conclusion that a black candidate of choice is likelyto prevail, and that in all events blacks in CD 23 will have a reasonableopportunity to elect candidates of their choice.\n\n164. Finally, the effects of incumbency provide further substantialsupport for the conclusion that CD 23 is likely to perform for a blackcandidate of choice. In each election from 1994 through 2000, Mr.Hastings was reelected; no election was close, and twice he had noopposition at all.\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e36\u003c/span\u003e Mr. Hastings now apparently is the candidate ofchoice of most of the district's black and non-black voters alike. New CD23, while comprised of a different set of voters, has similardemographics and is likely to perform for the black candidate of choice,with or without an incumbent. Absent a significant change incircumstances, the district is nearly certain to perform in any electioninvolving Mr. Hastings, the current incumbent black candidate of choice.Plaintiffs apparently concede this.\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e37\u003c/span\u003e\n\n165. In sum, CD 23 is likely to perform for black candidates ofchoice. The votes of blacks in CD 23 have not been diluted.\n\ne. CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT 3\n\n166. According to the 2000 census, the non-Hispanic black population ofnew CD 3 was 50.6%, and the Hispanic black population was 0.8%, for atotal black population of 51.4%. The non-Hispanic black voting agepopulation was 46.2%, and the Hispanic black voting age population was0.7%, for a total black voting age population of 46.9%. Other thingsbeing equal, the 46.9% black voting age population will increase duringthe coming decade.\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e38\u003c/span\u003e\n\n167. Even with only a 46.9% black voting age population, new CD 3 willafford black voters a reasonable opportunity to elect candidates ofchoice and probably will in fact perform for black candidates of choice.\n\n168. This is so in part because, based on 2000 data, blacks constitute61.3% of registered Democrats in new CD 3, and Democrats constitute 63.8%of registered voters. Republicans constitute only 22.7% of registeredvoters. Actual voting also is strongly Democratic; in the 2000presidential election, voters in new CD 3 voted 63.7% for Mr. Gore and34.2% for Mr. Bush. The black candidate of choice is likely to win acontested Democratic primary, and the Democratic nominee is likely to winthe general election.\n\n169. The history of prior CD 3 — which had different boundariesbut the same core and similar demographics as new CD 3 — isconsistent with the finding that a 51.4% total black population and 46.9%black voting age population are sufficient to cause the district toperform for a black candidate of choice. CD 3 as drawn in 1992 had agreater black population than as redrawn in 1996. See supra note 18. CD 3as redrawn in 1996 covered an area that, according to the 1990 census,had a non-Hispanic black population of 46.5%, Hispanic black populationof 0.5%, and total black population of 47.0%, more than four percentagepoints lower than the total black population of newly created CD 3 underthe 2000 census. Similarly, as redrawn in 1996, prior CD 3 covered anarea that, according to the 1990 census, had a non-Hispanic black votingage population of 42.3%, Hispanic black voting age population of 0.4%,and total black voting age population of 42.7%, again more than fourpoints lower than new CD 3 under the 2000 census.\n\n170. By the time of the 2000 census, prior CD 3 as redrawn in 1996 hada total black population of 50.8% and a total black voting age populationof 46.7% — comparable to, but slightly lower than, new CD 3.\n\n171. Prior CD 3 performed for the black candidate of choice in everyelection from 1992 through 2000. New CD 3 has demographics more favorableto black candidates of choice than did prior CD 3 when it was redrawn in1996 and indeed more favorable to black candidates of choice than thatversion of CD 3 would have today. The demographics of new CD 3 are likelyto become more favorable for black candidates of choice as time passes,just as occurred in prior CD 3. There is no reason to believe that new CD3 will perform less favorably for black candidates of choice in thecoming decade than did prior CD 3 in 1996, 1998, and 2000.\n\n172. Techniques of ecological regression and projection of futurevoting behavior that are reasonably reliable and accepted in the field ofpolitical science support the conclusion that CD 3 will perform for blackcandidates of choice. It is clear that, in a closed Democratic primary inwhich only a single candidate has substantial support among blackvoters, CD 3 is likely to perform for that candidate. None of theparties' analyses have projected a vote below 50% for the black candidateof choice in such an election. Further, it is likely that the Democraticprimary winner will prevail in any general election; plaintiffs concede asmuch.\n\n173. The virtually uncontested findings set forth in paragraph 172,without more, make it likely that CD 3 will perform for black candidatesof choice, because if ever the ability of CD 3 to elect a black candidateof choice is in jeopardy, it is likely that the Democratic primary willbe closed (see supra paragraph 160), and it is likely that there will bea single black candidate of choice (see supra paragraphs 161-162).\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e39\u003c/span\u003e\n\n174. Ms. Brown is a 10-year incumbent in CD 3. Her presence is notnecessary to, but provides further support for, the conclusion that CD 3is likely to perform for the black candidate of choice. See supraparagraph 164.\n\n175. There is no evidence that any constitutionally-permissiblealternative to CD 3 could be drawn that would meaningfully improve theprojected performance of this district for black candidates of choice.Plaintiffs have virtually conceded this.\n\n176. In sum, CD 3 is likely to perform for black candidates of choice.The votes of blacks in CD 3 have not been diluted.\n\nf. CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT 17\n\n177. According to the 2000 census, the non-Hispanic black population ofnew CD 17 was 57.9%, and the Hispanic black population was 2.2%, for atotal black population of 60.1%. The non-Hispanic black voting agepopulation was 53.9%, and the Hispanic black voting age population was2.1%, for a total black voting age population of 56.0%. Other thingsbeing equal, the 56.0% black voting age population will increase duringthe coming decade.\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e40\u003c/span\u003e\n\n178. Even with a 56.0% black voting age population, new CD 17 willafford black voters a reasonable opportunity to elect candidates ofchoice and probably will in fact perform for black candidates of choice.\n\n179. This is so in part because, according to 2000 data, blacksconstitute 65.9% of registered Democrats in new CD 17, and Democratsconstitute 71.5% of registered voters. Republicans constitute only 14.6%of registered voters. Actual voting also is overwhelmingly Democratic; inthe 2000 presidential election, voters in new CD 17 voted 83.9% for Mr.Gore and 15.1% for Mr. Bush. A black candidate of choice is likely to wina contested Democratic primary, and the Democratic nominee is likely towin the general election.\n\n180. The history of prior CD 17 — which had different boundariesbut the same core and similar demographics as the new CD 17 —suggests that a 60.1% total black population and 56.0% black voting agepopulation are sufficient to cause the district to perform for blackcandidates of choice. When first drawn in 1992,\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e41\u003c/span\u003e prior CD 17 had(according to the 1990 census) a non-Hispanic black population of 55.7%,Hispanic black population of 2.7%, and total black population of 58.4%,nearly two percentage points lower than the total black population ofnewly created CD 17 under the 2000 census. Similarly, when first drawn in1992, prior CD 17 had (according to the 1990 census) a non-Hispanic blackvoting age population of 51.3%, Hispanic black voting age population of2.7%, and total black voting age population of 54.0%, two points lowerthan new CD 17 under the 2000 census.\n\n181. The percentage black voting age population and black totalpopulation in prior CD 17 increased during the decade of the 1990s. By thetime of the 2000 census, prior CD 17 had a total black population of63.4% and a total black voting age population of 60.0% — higherthan new CD 17 — but there is no reason to believe that percentagesthat high were necessary for the district to perform for black candidatesof choice.\n\n182. Prior CD 17 performed for the black candidate of choice in everyelection from 1992 through 2000. New CD 17 has demographics morefavorable to black candidates of choice than did prior CD 17 when it wascreated. The demographics of new CD 17 are likely to become morefavorable for black candidates of choice as time passes, just as occurredin prior CD 17. There is no reason to believe that new CD 17 will performless favorably for black candidates of choice in the coming decade thandid prior CD 17 in the preceding decade.\n\n183. Techniques of ecological regression and projection of futurevoting behavior that are reasonably reliable and accepted in the field ofpolitical science support the conclusion that CD 17 will perform for blackcandidates of choice. It is clear that, in a closed Democratic primary inwhich only a single candidate has substantial support among blackvoters, CD 17 is likely to perform for that candidate. Indeed, even in anopen Democratic primary, plaintiffs' own projections show a blackcandidate of choice prevailing with 54.1% of the vote. See Pl. Exh. 81-Cat 15, Table 6. Further, it is likely that the Democratic primary winnerwill prevail in any general election; plaintiffs concede as much.\n\n184. There is no evidence that any constitutionally-permissiblealternative to CD 17 could be drawn that would meaningfully improve theprojected performance of this district for a black candidate of choice.Plaintiffs have virtually conceded this.\n\n185. In sum, CD 17 is likely to perform for black candidates ofchoice. The votes of blacks in CD 17 have not been diluted.\n\ng. PROPORTIONALITY\n\n186. According to the 2000 census, the voting age population ofFlorida's eight southernmost counties, which reasonably could bedenominated south Florida, was 16.3% black. The population of those eightcounties was sufficient for 8.9 congressional districts. Two districtsconstitute 22% of those 8.9 districts. CDs 17 and 23 are two of thedistricts in this eight-county area.\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e42\u003c/span\u003e\n\n187. According to the 2000 census, the voting age population of 16counties in northeast Florida was 14.7% black. The population of those 16counties was sufficient for 5.8 congressional districts. One districtconstitutes 17% of those 5.8 districts. CD 3 is one of the districts inthis 16-county area.\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e43\u003c/span\u003e\n\n3. STATE LEGISLATURE\n\na. BACKGROUND\n\n188. Florida's House of Representatives has 120 members and its Senatehas 40.\n\n189. In 1992, the Florida legislature adopted apportionment plans forthe House and Senate based on the 1990 census. The United StatesDepartment of Justice pre-cleared the House plan but objected to theSenate plan as it impacted Hillsborough County.\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e44\u003c/span\u003e The Governor andlegislative leaders chose not to call a special session to address theDepartment of Justice objections. The Florida Supreme Court redrew theSenate plan to address the objections. See In re Constitutionality ofSenate Joint Resolution 2G, Special Apportionment Session 1992,601 So.2d 543 (Fla. 1992). The Department of Justice pre-cleared theredrawn plan.\n\n190. The House and Senate plans were challenged before a three-judgepanel of the United States District Court for the Northern District ofFlorida. See De Grandy v. Wetherell, 815 F. Supp. 1550 (N.D. Fla. 1992).\n\n191. The House plan was challenged on grounds of alleged dilution ofblack votes in Escambia County (the westernmost county in the Floridapanhandle) and dilution of Hispanic votes in south Florida. The courtupheld a settlement agreement addressing the Escambia claims, and theaffected districts were redrawn. With respect to the south Floridaclaims, the court held that the plan impermissibly diluted Hispanicvotes, and the court adopted an alternative plan. Id. The United StatesSupreme Court stayed the court's decision with respect to south Floridadistricts and ultimately reversed, see Johnson v. De Grandy, 512 U.S. 997,114 S.Ct. 2647, 129 L.Ed.2d 775 (1994), thus leaving intact the Houseplan as adopted in 1992 by the Florida legislature (except for the changesin Escambia County).\n\n192. The Senate plan was challenged on the grounds of alleged dilutionof both black and Hispanic votes in south Florida. The district courtconcluded that the Senate plan diluted both black and Hispanic votes insouth Florida but that any remedy favoring one of these minorities wouldfurther dilute votes of the other. The court left the Senate plan intactas an acceptable resolution of the competing interests of the twogroups. The Supreme Court affirmed but on different grounds; it found nodilution. Id. The plan as drawn by the Florida Supreme Court thus was ineffect for the 1992 and 1994 elections.\n\n193. A separate lawsuit before a three-judge panel of the United StatesDistrict Court for the Middle District of Florida asserted a claim ofracial gerrymandering in Senate District 21 (in the Tampa area)inviolation of Shaw v. Reno, 509 U.S. 630, 113 S.Ct. 2816, 125 L.Ed.2d 511(1993). The court approved a settlement agreement under which SD 21 wasredrawn. See Scott v. Department of Justice, 920 F. Supp. 1248 (M.D.Fla. 1996).\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e45\u003c/span\u003e The Supreme Court affirmed. Lawyer v. Department ofJustice, 521 U.S. 567, 117 S.Ct. 2186, 138 L.Ed.2d 669 (1997). The planas redrawn was in effect for the 1996, 1998, and 2000 elections.\n\n194. By 2000, the House and Senate plans as then in effect had becomesubstantially malapportioned. On March 22, 2002, the Florida legislatureadopted new House and Senate plans by joint resolution. Under the FloridaConstitution, the Governor's approval was not required. See Fla. Coust.Art. III § 16(a).\n\n195. Under a procedure established by the Florida Constitution, seeFla. Const. Art. III § 16(c), the Florida Supreme Court reviewed theplans for facial compliance with the state and federal Constitutions andthe Voting Rights Act of 1965. As noted earlier, the court held the plansvalid. See In re Constitutionality of House Joint Resolution 1987,817 So.2d 819 (Fla. 2002). The court explicitly declined to addressas-applied challenges of the type at issue in the case at bar. By itsterms, the Florida Supreme Court's decision did not foreclose or expressany opinion on claims such as those at issue here.\n\nb. ULTIMATE FINDINGS\n\n196. The legislature's overriding goal with respect to statelegislative reapportionment in 2002 was to adopt plans that wouldwithstand legal challenges and would maximize the number of districtslikely to perform for Republicans. The legislature had no purpose todiscriminate against black or Hispanic candidates or voters. To thecontrary, the legislature affirmatively intended not to discriminateagainst black or Hispanic candidates or voters. The legislaturerecognized that adopting districts that would not dilute black orHispanic voting strength was fully consistent with — perhaps evencompelled by — the goal of adopting plans that would withstandlegal challenges.\n\n197. The Senate and House plans included districts ostensibly intendedto perform for black or Hispanic candidates of choice. Plaintiffs do notchallenge the overall number of ostensibly performing black or Hispanicdistricts. Plaintiffs do not challenge the compactness or configurationof any of the ostensibly performing black or Hispanic districts.Plaintiffs do not challenge the sufficiency of any of the Hispanicdistricts to perform for Hispanic candidates of choice. Plaintiffs dochallenge the sufficiency of certain ostensibly performing blackdistricts.\n\n198. Among ostensibly performing black Senate districts, plaintiffstake issue only with SDs 1 and 18, which are successors to prior SDs 2and 21. Plaintiffs concede, however, that there is no evidence that anyconstitutionally-permissible alternatives to SDs 1 or 18 could be drawnthat would meaningfully improve the projected performance of thesedistricts for black candidates of choice. Plaintiffs thus seek no reliefwith respect to the alleged dilution of black votes in these districts.\n\n199. Among ostensibly performing black House districts, plaintiffs takeissue only with HDs 103, 104, 108, 109, and 118 (all located inMiami-Dade County) and HDs 15, 39, and 94 (located outside Miami-DadeCounty). Plaintiffs concede, however, that there is no evidence that anyconstitutionally-permissible alternatives to HDs 15, 39, or 94 could bedrawn that would meaningfully improve the projected performance of thesedistricts for black candidates of choice. Plaintiffs thus seek no reliefwith respect to the alleged dilution of black votes in these districts.\n\n200. Plaintiffs assert that three of the Miami-Dade County districts(HDs 104, 108, and 118) will not perform for black candidates of choice,and that the other two challenged Miami-Dade County districts (HDs 103and 109) are unconstitutionally packed, thus wasting black votes. Thesefive Miami-Dade County districts are addressed below in separatesubsidiary findings. It is likely that each of these districts will infact perform for black candidates of choice.\n\n201. Race or Hispanic status was considered in the drawing ofperforming black or Hispanic State Senate and House districts in an effortto enhance performance of the districts for black or Hispanic candidatesof choice, to avoid dilution of the votes of black or Hispanic voters,and to comply with section 2 of the Voting Rights Act. Traditionaldistricting principles also were considered and respected in the drawingof these districts. No effort was made to afford blacks or Hispanicssubstantially greater than proportionalrepresentation or to afford themrepresentation inconsistent with traditional districting principles.Neither race nor Hispanic status was the controlling or predominantfactor in the drawing of such districts.\n\n202. The minority districts are reasonably compact.\n\n203. The minority districts in fact comply to a reasonable extent withtraditional districting principles.\n\n204. No greater number of reasonably compact performing minoritydistricts reasonably could have been drawn.\n\nc. STATE HOUSE DISTRICT 108\n\n205. According to the 2000 census, the non-Hispanic black population ofnew HD 108 was 57.7%, and the Hispanic black population was 2.3%, for atotal black population of 60.0%. The non-Hispanic black voting agepopulation was 53.0%, and the Hispanic black voting age population was2.2%, for a total black voting age population of 55.2%. Other thingsbeing equal, the 55.2% black voting age population will increase duringthe coming decade.\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e46\u003c/span\u003e\n\n206. A substantial share of the blacks in HD 108 are Haitian.\n\n207. Even with a 55.2% black voting age population, new HD 108 willafford black voters a reasonable opportunity to elect candidates of theirchoice and probably will in fact perform for a black candidate ofchoice.\n\n208. This is so in part because, according to 2000 data, blacksconstitute 56.4% of registered Democrats in new HD 108, and Democratsconstitute 67.5% of registered voters. Republicans constitute only 16.7%of registered voters. Actual voting also is overwhelmingly Democratic; inthe 2000 presidential election, voters in new HD 108 voted 79.8% for Mr.Gore and 18.9% for Mr. Bush. A black candidate of choice is likely to wina contested Democratic primary, and the Democratic nominee is likely towin the general election.\n\n209. The history of prior HD 108 — which had different boundariesbut the same core and similar demographics as the new HD 108 — isnot inconsistent with the finding that a 60.0% total black population and55.2% black voting age population are sufficient to cause the district toperform for a black candidate of choice. When first drawn in 1992, priorHD 108 had (according to the 1990 census) a non-Hispanic black populationof 62.7%, Hispanic black population of 3.4%, and total black populationof 66.1%. Similarly, when first drawn in 1992, prior HD 108 had(according to the 1990 census) a non-Hispanic black voting age populationof 57.1%, Hispanic black voting age population of 3.3%, and total blackvoting age population of 60.4%. This is more than five percentage pointshigher than the comparable numbers for new HD 108 under the 2000 census.\n\n210. The percentage black voting age population and black totalpopulation in prior HD 108 increased during the decade of the 1990s. Bythe time of the 2000 census, prior HD 108 had a total black population of68.1% and a total black voting age population of 64.3% — more thaneight points higher than new HD 108 — but there is no reason tobelieve that percentages that high were necessary for thedistrict to perform for a black candidate of choice.\n\n211. Prior HD 108 performed for the black candidate of choice in everyelection from 1992 through 2000. In 1994 and 1996, the incumbent (a blackfirst elected in 1992) was unopposed. In 1998, the only two candidateswere black; the incumbent won the Democratic primary and was unopposed inthe general election. In 2000, the seat was open. Philip J. Brutus, whois Haitian-American and black, won the Democratic primary with over 63%of the vote against a single opponent. Mr. Brutus won the generalelection with over 81% of the vote, thus becoming the firstHaitian-American to serve in the Florida legislature.\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e47\u003c/span\u003e\n\n212. The conclusion that HD 108 will perform for a black candidate ofchoice also is supported by the history of HD 118 — a differentdistrict in the same county that has performed for black candidates ofchoice despite having a lower percentage of black voters. HD 118performed for the black candidate of choice in each election from 1992through 2000. According to the 1990 census, the black total population(34.6%) and black voting age population (31.6%) were substantially lowerfor prior HD 118 than the comparable numbers for new HD 108 under the2000 census. So far as shown by this record, the likelihood that HD 108will perform for black candidates of choice in the coming decade ishigher than the likelihood would have been with respect to HD 118 basedon information known in 1992. Prior HD 118 performed, and it is likelythat new HD 108 will perform also.\n\n213. Techniques of ecological regression and projection of futurevoting behavior that are reasonably reliable and accepted in the field ofpolitical science support the conclusion that HD 108 will perform forblack candidates of choice. In a closed Democratic primary in which onlya single candidate has substantial support among black voters, HD 108 islikely to perform for that candidate. None of the parties' analyses haveprojected a vote below 50% for the black candidate of choice in such anelection. Defendants' projection of 52.0% is reasonable. See Speaker'sExh. 75-2, Table R6; Tr. 1334. Further, it is likely that the Democraticprimary winner will prevail in any general election.\n\n214. The virtually uncontested findings set forth in paragraph 213,without more, make it likely that HD 108 will perform for blackcandidates of choice, because if ever the ability of HD 108 to elect ablack candidate of choice is in jeopardy, it is likely that theDemocratic primary will be closed (see supra paragraph 160), and it islikely that there will be a single black candidate of choice (see supraparagraphs 161-162).\n\n215. The likely margin by which HD 108 will perform for a blackcandidate of choice is not as high as that attending prior HD 108. Forthe two districts HD 108 and HD 118 combined, however, the likelyperformance for black candidates of choice has been enhanced; the likelyperformance of HD 118 for a black candidate of choice has been enhanced bymore than the likely performance of HD 108 has been diminished.\n\n216. In the unlikely event of an open primary in HD 108, a blackcandidate of choice likely would be competitive, but, other things beingequal, would have less than an even chance of prevailing. Plaintiffs'projection that a black candidate ofchoice would draw 47.2% of the votein such a primary is reasonable. See Pl. Exh. 81-C at 38, Table 13.Particular candidacies and particular issues could turn any such electioneither way.\n\n217. In sum, HD 108 is likely to perform for black candidates ofchoice. The votes of blacks in HD 108 have not been diluted.\n\nd. STATE HOUSE DISTRICT 118\n\n218. According to the 2000 census, the non-Hispanic black population ofnew HD 118 was 43.1%, and the Hispanic black population was 2.0%, for atotal black population of 45.1%. The non-Hispanic black voting agepopulation was 39.9%, and the Hispanic black voting age population was1.9%, for a total black voting age population of 41.8%.\n\n219. Even with a 41.8% black voting age population, new HD 118 willafford black voters a reasonable opportunity to elect candidates of theirchoice and probably will in fact perform for black candidates of choice.\n\n220. This is so in part because, according to 2000 data, blacksconstitute 64.4% of registered Democrats in new HD 118, and Democratsconstitute 61.8% of registered voters. Republicans constitute only 20.2%of registered voters. Actual voting also is overwhelmingly Democratic; inthe 2000 presidential election, voters in new HD 118 voted 74.8% for Mr.Gore and 24.1% for Mr. Bush. A black candidate of choice is likely to wina contested Democratic primary, and the Democratic nominee is likely towin the general election.\n\n221. The history of prior HD 118 — which had different boundariesbut the same core and similar demographics as the new HD 118 —supports the finding that a 45.1% total black population and 41.8% blackvoting age population are sufficient to cause the district to perform forblack candidates of choice. When first drawn in 1992, prior HD 118 had(according to the 1990 census) a non-Hispanic black population of 33.3%,Hispanic black population of 1.3%, and total black population of 34.6%.Similarly, when first drawn in 1992, prior HD 118 had (according to the1990 census) a non-Hispanic black voting age population of 30.4%,Hispanic black voting age population of 1.2%, and total black voting agepopulation of 31.6%. This is more than ten percentage points lower thanthe comparable numbers for new HD 118 under the 2000 census.\n\n222. Prior HD 118 performed for the black candidate of choice in everyelection from 1992 through 2000. In 1992, a black candidate won aplurality in the initial Democratic primary, won the Democratic primaryrunoff with 63.2% of the vote, and won the general election with 62.7% ofthe vote.\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e48\u003c/span\u003e In 1994, the incumbent was reelected without opposition.In 1996, the incumbent was unopposed in the Democratic primary and wonwith 64.5% of the vote in the general election. In 1998, the incumbentwas unopposed in the Democratic primary and won with 63.0% of the vote inthe general election. In 2000, there was an open seat. A first and secondDemocratic primary cut six candidates to one, who was black;\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e49\u003c/span\u003e he inturn won the general election with only write-in opposition.\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e50\u003c/span\u003e\n\n223. Techniques of ecological regression and projection of futurevoting behavior that are reasonably reliable and accepted in the field ofpolitical science support the conclusion that HD 118 will perform forblack candidates of choice. In a closed Democratic primary in which onlya single candidate has substantial support among black voters, HD 118 islikely to perform for that candidate. None of the parties' analyses haveprojected a vote below 50% for the black candidate of choice in such anelection. Further, it is likely that the Democratic primary winner willprevail in any general election.\n\n224. The virtually uncontested findings set forth in paragraph 223,without more, make it likely that HD 118 will perform for blackcandidates of choice, because if ever the ability of HD 118 to elect ablack candidate of choice is in jeopardy, it is likely that theDemocratic primary will be closed (see supra paragraph 160), and it islikely that there will be a single black candidate of choice (see supraparagraphs 161-162).\n\n225. In the unlikely event of an open primary in HD 118, a blackcandidate of choice likely would prevail, but an opposing candidate couldbe competitive. Plaintiffs' projection that a black candidate of choicewould draw 51.3% of the vote in such a primary is reasonable.\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e51\u003c/span\u003eParticular candidacies and particular issues could turn any such electioneither way.\n\n226. There is no evidence that any constitutionally-permissiblealternative to HD 118 could be drawn that would meaningfully improve theprojected performance of this district for a black candidate of choice.\n\n227. In sum, HD 118 is likely to perform for black candidates ofchoice. The votes of blacks in HD 118 have not been diluted.\n\ne. STATE HOUSE DISTRICT 104\n\n228. According to the 2000 census, the non-Hispanic black population ofnew HD 104 was 57.8%, and the Hispanic black population was 2.2%, for atotal black population of 60.0%. The non-Hispanic black voting agepopulation was 53.7%, and the Hispanic black voting age population was2.2%, for a total black voting age population of 55.9%. Other thingsbeing equal, the 55.9% black voting age population will increase duringthe coming decade.\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e52\u003c/span\u003e\n\n229. Even with a 55.9% black voting age population, new HD 104 willafford black voters a reasonable opportunity to elect candidates of theirchoice and probably will in fact perform for a black candidate ofchoice.\n\n230. This is so in part because, according to 2000 data, blacksconstitute 64.1% of registered Democrats in new HD 104, and Democratsconstitute 73.3% of registered voters. Republicans constitute only 12.1%of registered voters. Actual voting also is overwhelmingly Democratic; inthe 2000 presidential election, voters in new HD 104 voted 86.5% for Mr.Gore and 12.7% for Mr. Bush. A black candidate of choice islikely to win a contested Democratic primary, and the Democratic nomineeis likely to win the general election.\n\n231. The history of prior HD 104 — which had different boundariesbut the same core and similar demographics as the new HD 104 —suggests that a 60.0% total black population and 55.9% black voting agepopulation are sufficient to cause the district to perform for blackcandidates of choice. When first drawn in 1992, prior HD 104 had(according to the 1990 census) a non-Hispanic black population of 56.5%,Hispanic black population of 2.3%, and total black population of 58.8%,lower than the total black population of newly created HD 104 under the2000 census. Similarly, when first drawn in 1992, prior HD 104 had(according to the 1990 census) a non-Hispanic black voting age populationof 51.1%, Hispanic black voting age population of 2.2%, and total blackvoting age population of 53.3%, again lower than new HD 104 under the2000 census.\n\n232. The percentage black voting age population and black totalpopulation in prior HD 104 increased during the decade of the 1990s. Bythe time of the 2000 census, prior HD 104 had a total black population of70.0% and a total black voting age population of 65.9% — ten pointshigher than new HD 104 — but there is no reason to believe thatpercentages that high were necessary for the district to perform for ablack candidate of choice.\n\n233. Prior HD 104 performed for the black candidate of choice in everyelection from 1992 through 2000. New HD 104 has demographics morefavorable to a black candidate of choice than did prior HD 104 when itwas created. The demographics of new HD 104 are likely to become morefavorable for black candidates of choice as time passes, just as occurredin prior HD 104. There is no reason to believe that new HD 104 willperform less favorably for black candidates of choice in the coming decadethan did old HD 104 in the prior decade.\n\n234. Techniques of ecological regression and projection of futurevoting behavior that are reasonably reliable and accepted in the field ofpolitical science support the conclusion that HD 104 will perform forblack candidates of choice. In a closed Democratic primary in which onlya single candidate has substantial support among black voters, HD 104 islikely to perform for that candidate. Indeed, even in an open Democraticprimary, plaintiffs' own projections show a black candidate of choiceprevailing with 53.7% of the vote. See Pl. Exh. 81-C at 38, Table 13.Further, it is likely that the Democratic primary winner will prevail inany general election.\n\n235. In sum, HD 104 is likely to perform for a black candidate ofchoice. The votes of blacks in HD 104 have not been diluted.\n\nf. STATE HOUSE DISTRICT 103\n\n236. According to the 2000 census, the non-Hispanic black population ofnew HD 103 was 70.5%, and the Hispanic black population was 2.5%, for atotal black population of 73.0%. The non-Hispanic black voting agepopulation was 67.9%, and the Hispanic black voting age population was2.5%, for a total black voting age population of 70.4%.\n\n237. According to 2000 data, blacks constitute 82.2% of registeredDemocrats in new HD 103, and Democrats constitute 75.8% of registeredvoters. Republicans constitute only 11.5% of registered voters. Actualvoting also is overwhelmingly Democratic; in the 2000 presidentialelection, voters in new HD 103 voted 88.0% for Mr. Gore and 11.4% forMr. Bush. A black candidate of choice is likely to win a contestedDemocratic primary, and theDemocratic nominee is likely to win the general election.\n\n238. New HD 103 will afford black voters a reasonable opportunity toelect candidates of their choice and almost certainly will in factperform for black candidates of choice. Plaintiffs concede this. Indeed,plaintiffs' claim is not that HD 103 will not perform; instead, theirclaim is that HD 103 is \"packed,\" that is, that there are more blacks inHD 103 than needed to elect black candidates of choice, thus in effect\"wasting\" black votes.\n\n239. New HD 103 could perform for black candidates of choice with farfewer blacks in the district.\n\n240. HD 103 is contiguous to HDs 104, 105, 110, and 112.\n\n241. HDs 110 and 112 are majority Hispanic districts. Moving blackvoters into HD 110 or HD 112 would not enhance the influence of thosevoters or of black voters generally.\n\n242. HD 104 is already a performing black majority district. See supraparagraphs 228-235. Moving black voters into HD 104 would not enhance theinfluence of those voters or of black voters generally.\n\n243. HD 105 has total population 45.0% white, 30.0% non-Hispanicblack, 1.2% Hispanic black, 20.4% non-black Hispanic, and 3.4% other. Theboundary between HD 103 and HD 105 is the county line separatingMiami-Dade and Broward Counties. HD 103 is entirely in Miami-DadeCounty. HD 105 is entirely in Broward County. There was thus a reasonunrelated to race for the drawing of the line separating HD 103 from HD105. There has been no showing that blacks could be moved out of HD 103into HD 105, consistent with traditional zoning principles and applicablelaw, to an extent that would materially increase black influence in HD105. There has been no showing that moving black voters into HD 105 wouldenhance the influence of those voters or black voters generally.\n\n244. Moving blacks out of HD 103 would not increase the number ofdistricts expected to perform for black candidates of choice.\n\n245. Moving blacks out of HD 103 would not result in any black voterhaving a greater opportunity to impact the electoral process than thatvoter has under the plan as adopted by the Florida legislature.\n\ng. STATE HOUSE DISTRICT 109\n\n246. According to the 2000 census, the non-Hispanic black population ofnew HD 109 was 61.1%, and the Hispanic black population was 3.3%, for atotal black population of 64.4%. The non-Hispanic black voting agepopulation was 56.8%, and the Hispanic black voting age population was3.6%, for a total black voting age population of 60.4%.\n\n247. According to 2000 data, blacks constitute 79.2% of registeredDemocrats in new HD 109, and Democrats constitute 77.5% of registeredvoters. Republicans constitute only 11.3% of registered voters. Actualvoting also is overwhelmingly Democratic; in the 2000 presidentialelection, voters in new HD 109 voted 86.8% for Mr. Gore and 12.3% forMr. Bush. A black candidate of choice is likely to win a contestedDemocratic primary, and the Democratic nominee is likely to win thegeneral election.\n\n248. New HD 109 will afford black voters a reasonable opportunity toelect candidates of their choice and almost certainly will in factperform for black candidates of choice. Plaintiffs concede this. Indeed,plaintiffs' claim is not that HD 109 will not perform, instead, theirclaim is that HD 109 is \"packed,\" that is, that there are more blacks inHD 109 than needed toelect black candidates of choice, thus in effect\"wasting\" black votes.\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e53\u003c/span\u003e\n\n249. New HD 109 could perform for black candidates of choice with fewerblacks in the district, but the level of confidence in the district'sperformance would decrease as the black population decreased.\n\n250. HD 109 is contiguous to HDs 104, 106, 107, 108, and 113. HDs 104and 108 are already performing black majority districts. See supraparagraphs 228-235 and 205-217. HDs 107 and 113 are majority Hispanicdistricts. Moving black voters into HD 107 or HD 113 would not enhancethe influence of those voters or of black voters generally. HD 106 hastotal population 52.0% white, 5.6% non-Hispanic black, 1.0% Hispanicblack, 38.5% non-black Hispanic, and 2.9% other. There has been noshowing that blacks could be moved out of HD 109 into HD 106 consistentwith traditional zoning principles and applicable law, to an extent thatwould materially increase black influence in HD 106. There has been noshowing that moving black voters into HD 106 would enhance the influenceof those voters or black voters generally.\n\n251. Moving blacks out of HD 109 would not increase the number ofdistricts expected to perform for black candidates of choice.\n\n252. Moving blacks out of HD 109 would not result in any black voterhaving a greater opportunity to impact the electoral process than thatvoter has under the plan as adopted by the Florida legislature.\n\nh. PROPORTIONALITY\n\n253. According to the 2000 census, the voting age population ofMiami-Dade County was 19.2% black. The total population of Miami-DadeCounty was 2,253,362, enough for 16.9 members of the Florida House ofRepresentatives. Under the apportionment plan adopted in 2002, there are18 districts wholly or partly in Miami-Dade County. Five districtsconstitute 29.6% of 16.9 districts and 27.8% of 18 districts. CDs 103,104, 108, 109, and 118 are performing black districts in Miami-DadeCounty.\n\nB. LEGAL CONCLUSIONS\n\nPlaintiffs claims of vote dilution based on race are governed by theVoting Rights Act of 1965, as amended. Section 2(a) of the Act prohibitsany state or political subdivision from denying or abridging anycitizen's right to vote on account of race or color, 42 U.S.C. § 1973(a), or membership in a language minority group,42 U.S.C. § 1973b(f)(2). Section 2(b) provides that it is a violationof this standard if \"the political processes leading to nomination orelection . . . are not equally open to participation by members of aclass of citizens protected by\" the statute \"in that its members haveless opportunity than other members of the electorate to participate inthe political process and to elect representatives of their choice.\"42 U.S.C. § 1973 (b) (emphasis added).\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e54\u003c/span\u003e Section2(b) alsoincludes a proviso: \"nothing in this section establishes a right to havemembers of a protected class elected in numbers equal to their proportionin the population.\" Id. This statutory language provides the startingpoint for our analysis.\n\nTo prevail on a claim under section 2, a plaintiff need not show that achallenged state action was undertaken with discriminatory intent. It issufficient if a challenged action has a prohibited effect, irrespectiveof the intent with which it was adopted. See Thornburg v. Gingles,478 U.S. 30, 35, 106 S.Ct. 2752, 2758, 92 L.Ed.2d 25 (1986).\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e55\u003c/span\u003e\n\nSection 2 is violated when \"a certain electoral law, practice, orstructure interacts with social and historical conditions to cause aninequality in the opportunities enjoyed by black [or other coveredminority voters] and white voters to elect their preferredrepresentatives.\" Id. at 47, 106 S.Ct. at 2764. This requires thatdistrict lines be drawn in a manner that does not impermissibly diluteminority votes, that is, in a manner affording an equal opportunity forthe election of minority candidates of choice, when a minority group issufficiently large, compact, and cohesive to achieve that result. Seeid. at 49-51, 106 S.Ct. at 2765-66 (finding dilution in multi-memberdistricts and announcing three factors necessary to a prima facie case);Growe v. Emison, 507 U.S. 25, 40, 113 S.Ct. 1075, 1084, 122 L.Ed.2d 388(1993) (applying same analysis to single-member districts).\n\nTo prevail on a claim of vote dilution under section 2, a plaintiffmust, at a minimum, establish the three Gingles factors: (1) that theprotected group is \"sufficiently large and geographically compact\"; (2)that the protected group is \"politically cohesive\"; and (3) that othervoters — ordinarily the white majority — vote sufficiently asa bloc that they \"usually\" defeat minority candidates of choice.Gingles, 478 U.S. at 50-51, 106 S.Ct. at 2766.\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e56\u003c/span\u003e All othercircumstances affecting the protected group's ability to elect candidatesof choice also are relevant; the three Gingles factors do not alonenecessarily establish a section 2 violation. The essence of the requiredshowing is this:\n\n[P]laintiffs can prevail on a dilution claim only if they show that, under the totality of the circumstances, the State's apportionment scheme has the effect of diminishing or abridging the voting strength of the protected class.\n\nVoinovich v. Quilter, 507 U.S. 146, 157, 113 S.Ct. 1149, 1157, 122L.Ed.2d 500 (1993).\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e57\u003c/span\u003e\n\nIn the case at bar, it is undisputed that the Gingles factors aresatisfied. In other words, there are groups of black voters in Floridathat are sufficiently large and geographically compact to allow thecreation of districts that would perform for black candidates of choice,black voters are politically cohesive, and other (non-black) voters votesufficiently as a bloc that, in the absence of appropriately drawndistricts, those voters would usually defeat black candidates of choice.It also is undisputed that, under the totality of the circumstances, anyapportionment plan that included no districts likely to perform for blackcandidates of choice would have the effect of impermissibly diminishingor abridging black voting strength in violation of the Voting RightsAct. It is thus undisputed that section 2 clearly required the drawing ofat least some number of districts likely to perform for black candidatesof choice.\n\nThe parties have not explicitly set forth their respective positions onhow many minority districts are required by section 2 under thecircumstances of the case at bar, nor on how many of the districts drawnby the legislature should be counted as minority districts. That dependsto some degree on semantics: how the term \"minority district\" isdefined. Courts sometimes have suggested that districts or potentialdistricts of consequence in section 2 dilution claims are only those withan actual majority, or even a super-majority, of minority population orvoters. See, e.g., Perez v. Pasadena Independent School Dist., 165 F.3d 368(5th Cir. 1999) (holding that, under the first Gingles factor, nodilution occurs unless a district could be drawn in which the minority atissue would constitute an actual majority of citizens eligible to vote);McNeil v. Springfield Park Dist., 851 F.2d 937 (7th Cir. 1988) (holdingthat, under the first Gingles factor, no dilution occurs unless adistrict could be drawn in which the minority at issue would constitutean actual majority of the voting age population); see also AfricanAmerican Voting Rights Legal Defense Fund, Inc. v. Villa, 54 F.3d 1345,1348 n. 4 (8th Cir. 1995) (finding no section 2 violation because thepercentage of safe black wards was roughly the same as the percentageblack voting age population, and defining a safe ward as one in which the\"black majority has a practical opportunity to elect the candidate of itschoice,\" that is, a district with either 60% black voting age populationor 65% black total population);Ketchum v. Byrne, 740 F.2d 1398, 1415(7th Cir. 1984) (disapproving district court's refusal to requiresuper-majorities in districts adopted as a remedy for a section 2violation and asserting \"that a guideline of 65% of total population . . .has achieved general acceptance in redistricting jurisprudence\").\n\nBut the approach of focusing mechanically on the percentage of minoritypopulation (or voting age population or registered voters) in a particulardistrict, without assessing the actual voting strength of the minority incombination with other voters, has been justly criticized. See, e.g.,Bernard Grofman et al., Drawing Effective Minority Districts: AConceptual Framework and Some Empirical Evidence, 79 N.C. L. Rev. 1383(2001). Other courts have recognized the significance of districts— sometimes labeled \"influence districts\" — in which membersof a minority group do not constitute a majority but nonetheless have theability, acting together with other (\"cross-over\") voters, to electminority candidates of choice. See, e.g., Voinovich, 507 U.S. at 157, 113S.Ct. at 1157 (assuming without deciding that section 2 could be violatedby a state's failure to create an \"influence district\" in which minorityvoters, although not a majority, could combine with white cross-overvoters to elect minority candidates of choice); Uno v. City of Holyoke,72 F.3d 973 (1st Cir. 1995) (vacating district court's finding of nosection 2 violation based on the impracticality of drawing any districtin which the minority would constitute an actual majority and remandingfor consideration of influence districts); Page v. Bartels,144 F. Supp.2d 346 (D.N.J. 2001) (three-judge court) (finding noviolation of section 2 because minority voters, together with cross-overvoters, could usually elect minority candidates of choice, thus negatingthe third Gingles factor); Rural West Tennessee African-American AffairsCouncil, Inc. v. McWherter, 877 F. Supp. 1096 (W.D. Tenn. 1995)(three-judge court) (holding that any district in which a minority groupcomposes 25% to 55% of the voting age population is an \"influencedistrict\" that should be considered in evaluating the \"totality of thecircumstances\" under Gingles).\n\nWe have no occasion to devise a formula for determining how manydistricts of one type or another are required by section 2. We use theterm \"performing minority district\" to refer to a district that is likelyto perform for — that is, usually to result in the election of— minority candidates of choice. Such a district may or may nothave an actual majority (or super-majority) of minority population,voting age population, or registered voters.\n\nThere is no bright line test for determining whether a district islikely to perform for minority candidates of choice. All circumstancesthat are likely to affect voting behavior and election outcomes in thedistrict are relevant. It ordinarily is sufficient if, under all thecircumstances, the district is drawn in a manner likely to result in theelection of minority candidates of choke in most elections. See, e.g.,Gingles, 478 U.S. at 49, 106 S.Ct. at 2765-66 (stating that in order forthere to be impermissible dilution, \"a bloc voting majority must usuallybe able to defeat candidates supported by a politically cohesive,geographically insular minority group\") (emphasis in original); Johnsonv. De Grandy, 512 U.S. 997, 1014 n.ll, 114 S.Ct. 2647, 2658 n. 11, 129L.Ed.2d 775 (1994) (\"the ultimate right of § 2 is equality ofopportunity, not a guarantee of electoral success\"); Johnson v. Hamrick,296 F.3d 1065 (11th Cir. 2002) (rejecting section 2 racial vote dilutionclaim on ground that plaintiffs failed to show that white bloc votingregularly defeated the candidate preferred by black voters); Clarke v.City ofCincinnati, 40 F.3d 807 (6th Cir. 1994) (same).\n\nIt is uncontested in the case at bar that section 2 imposes norequirement greater than the creation of the number of performingminority districts that ostensibly are included in the plans adopted bythe Florida legislature. It also is uncontested that nothing in section 2or the Constitution prohibits the creation of this number of performingminority districts. The dispute in the case at bar is not whether thisnumber of performing minority districts is required, nor whether thisnumber of performing minority districts is sufficient. Instead, theparties implicitly accept, for purposes of this litigation, that thisnumber of performing districts is both required and sufficient; theparties disagree only on whether the ostensibly performing districts drawnby the legislature are in fact likely to perform.\n\nIn addressing this issue, the parties have appropriately focused onactual voting strength, as have we. Under Gingles, our task\n\nis to consider the \"totality of the circumstances\" and to determine, based \"upon a searching practical evaluation of the `past and present reality,'\" S. Rep. [No. 97-417, 97th Cong. 2nd Sess. 30 (1982)], U.S. Code Cong. \u0026 Admin. News 1982, p. 208 (footnote omitted), whether the political process is equally open to minority voters. \"`This determination is peculiarly dependent upon the facts of each case,'\" Rogers [v. Lodge, 458 U.S. 613, 621, 102 S.Ct. 3272, 73 L.Ed.2d 1012 (1982)], quoting Nevett v. Sides, 571 F.2d 209, 224 (CA5 1978), and requires \"an intensely local appraisal of the design and impact\" of the contested electoral mechanisms. 458 U.S. at 622.\n\nGingles, 478 U.S. at 79, 106 S.Ct. at 2781.\n\nA searching practical evaluation of past and present reality, based onan intensely local appraisal of the totality of the circumstances,focuses on the likely actual effects of the apportionment plans atissue.\n\nThis is particularly appropriate under the specific circumstances ofthis case. This case does not involve an attempt to create minoritydistricts within a jurisdiction for the first time. Instead, this caseinvolves districts with an unbroken 10-year history of demonstratedperformance for minority candidates of choice. By agreeing, at leastimplicitly, that the numbers of ostensibly performing districts includedin the current plans are the appropriate numbers, the parties have ineffect agreed that if the ostensibly performing black districts will infact perform for black voters — as we have found they will —then under the totality of the circumstances, black voters will have areasonable opportunity to elect candidates of their choice, and blackvotes will not be diluted.\n\nAs set forth in detail in our findings of fact, in the districts thathave been challenged in the case at bar, black candidates of choice willprevail in most (if not all) elections. This is sufficient to defeatplaintiffs' racial vote dilution claims. We thus address no further thepercentage of total population, voting age population, or registeredvoters that might be required, in other circumstances, to cause adistrict to perform for minority candidates of choice.\n\nIn sum, under the congressional and state legislative apportionmentplans adopted by the Florida legislature, black voters will not have \"lessopportunity than other members of the electorate to participate in thepolitical process and to elect representatives of their choice.\"42 U.S.C. § 1973 (b). The apportionment plans will not have \"theeffect of diminishing orabridging the voting strength\" of black voters.Voinovich, 507 U.S. at 157, 113 S.Ct. at 1157. No violation of section 2has been established.\n\nIII. VOTE DILUTION BASED ON POLITICAL PARTY\n\nThe plaintiffs and intervenors also allege that the Florida legislaturepolitically gerrymandered the congressional districts\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e58\u003c/span\u003e to favorRepublicans, thereby violating the rights of Democratic voters guaranteedby the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e59\u003c/span\u003e CitingDavis v. Bandemer, 478 U.S. 109, 106 S.Ct. 2797, 92 L.Ed.2d 85 (1986),these parties contend that the redistricting plan was intentionallydesigned to have the impermissible effect of diluting the voting strengthof Florida Democrats. Specifically, they argue that, in the state ofFlorida, where the Republican/Democrat divide is near 50/50, theredistricting plan is unconstitutional because eighteen of the proposeddistricts will likely perform for a Republican candidate, and only sevendistricts will do so for a Democratic candidate. Although the plaintiffsand intervenors acknowledge that the Equal Protection Clause does notguarantee proportional representation, they claim that this 18/7disparity simply goes \"too far\" and requires a federal court to come totheir rescue.\n\n\"Too far,\" however, is not a workable standard with which to analyzeproperly the redistricting plan and its effects on Florida's Democraticvoters. Therefore, before discussing the relevant facts in this case, ourfirst task is to discern the correct rule of law. Our starting point isBandemer, where a majority of the Court found justiciable a claim byIndiana Democrats that a reapportionment plan designed by theRepublican-controlled legislature was an unconstitutional politicalgerrymander. Bandemer, 478 U.S. at 125, 106 S.Ct. at 2806. Only aplurality, however, agreed on how exactly the Democrats could succeed ontheir claim. Writing for that plurality, Justice White indicated that the\"plaintiffs were required to prove both intentional discrimination againstan identifiable political group and an actual discriminatory effect onthat group.\" Id. at 127, 106 S.Ct. at 2808 (citing City of Mobile v.Bolden, 446 U.S. 55, 67-68, 100 S.Ct. 1490, 1499-1500, 64 L.Ed.2d 47(1980)).\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e60\u003c/span\u003e\n\nAlthough Bandemer's two-part test for equal protection claims had beenwell-established in the racial vote dilution context, the plurality didnot explain how that testshould apply in political gerrymanderingcases.\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e61\u003c/span\u003e All that is clear from the plurality's opinion is that thetest for political gerrymandering claims is strongly linked to the lineof cases involving racial vote dilution. Indeed, in enunciating and thendiscussing the proper analysis of political gerrymandering claims, theplurality repeatedly drew on that long history, beginning with Whitcombv. Chavis, 403 U.S. 124, 91 S.Ct. 1858, 29 L.Ed.2d 363 (1971), and Whitev. Regester, 412 U.S. 755, 93 S.Ct. 2332, 37 L.Ed.2d 314 (1973), andevolving through City of Mobile v. Bolden, 446 U.S. 55, 100 S.Ct. 1490,64 L.Ed.2d 47 (1980), and Rogers v. Lodge, 458 U.S. 613, 102 S.Ct. 3272,73 L.Ed.2d 1012 (1982).\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e62\u003c/span\u003e\n\nTherefore, in our attempt to articulate the rule of law in this case,we rely heavily on those well-worn cases that analyzed vote dilutionclaims brought by racial and ethnic groups under the Equal ProtectionClause.\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e63\u003c/span\u003e In subpart A, we trace the analytical evolution of thosecases and emphasize a point the Bandemer plurality did not — thatthe minority group must show, among other factors, that the challengedscheme is actually the cause of their political impotence. In Rogers, forexample, the Court articulated a group of evidentiary factors that acourt should consider to determine whether unconstitutional vote dilutionhas been established. Rogers, 458 U.S. at 620 n. 8, 102 S.Ct. at 3277 n.8. Prominent among those was racially polarized bloc voting, withoutwhich, the Court explained, the minority group could not establish thatthe electoral scheme was the actual cause of its inability to participatepolitically. Id. at 623, 102 S.Ct. at 3279 (\"[W]ithout [proof of] blocvoting[,] the minority candidates would not loseelections solely becauseof their race.\"). This requirement of proving that an electoral schemecaused the minority group's inability to participate politically was morefully explained in Thornburg v. Gingles, 478 U.S. 30, 106 S.Ct. 2752, 92L.Ed.2d 25 (1986), which analyzed a vote dilution claim under the VotingRights Act, 42 U.S.C. § 1973.\n\nIn subpart B, we examine the Gingles Court's analysis, which requiredthat a minority group establish three \"necessary preconditions\": (1) thatit is geographically compact; (2) that it is politically cohesive; and(3) that the majority group votes as a bloc and usually defeats theminority group's candidates. Id. at 48-51, 106 S.Ct. at 2765-67. Wemaintain that, even though Gingles did not involve an equal protectionclaim, the three factors were derived by the Court from the principlesset forth in the vote dilution cases brought under the Equal ProtectionClause. We therefore conclude that the three preconditions have alwaysbeen and remain elements of constitutional vote dilution claims.\n\nIn subpart C, we hold that the three Gingles preconditions, along withother factors, establish a prima facie case of \"intentionaldiscrimination against an identifiable political group and an actualdiscriminatory effect on that group.\" Bandemer, 478 U.S. at 127, 106S.Ct. at 2808. First, we explain why the three Gingles preconditionsapply in the political gerrymandering context just as they do in racialvote dilution cases. Second, we discuss the two-prong test set forth inBandemer — legislative intent and discriminatory effects — inlight of the three Gingles preconditions.\n\nFinally, in subpart D, we analyze the facts in the instant case anddetermine whether the plaintiffs and intervenors have properlyestablished an Equal Protection Clause violation. We conclude that theyhave not, primarily because they have not shown that Democrats arepolitically cohesive and geographically compact, and that Republicans blocvote in a way that will \"usually defeat\" the Democrats' candidates ofchoice.\n\nA. EQUAL PROTECTION VOTE DILUTION CASES\n\nThe Supreme Court first decided, in Baker v. Carr, 369 U.S. 186, 82S.Ct. 691, 7 L.Ed.2d 663 (1962), that a claim asserted under the EqualProtection Clause challenging the constitutionality of a state'slegislative apportionment presented a justiciable controversy. Two yearslater, the Court struck down two legislatively-proposed apportionmentplans that provided election districts of disparate sizes. Reynolds v.Sims, 377 U.S. 533, 84 S.Ct. 1362, 12 L.Ed.2d 506 (1964). The Court inReynolds was not concerned that a person was denied his right to vote orthat his vote was not counted, but was instead worried that the vote of aperson living in one district was more heavily weighted than the vote ofone living in another, and therefore violated the one person, one voteclause. Id. at 563-64, 84 S.Ct. at 1382; see also Bandemer, 478 U.S. at123, 106 S.Ct. at 2805-06. The Reynolds Court recognized that \"each andevery citizen has an inalienable right to full and effectiveparticipation in the political processes of his State's legislativebodies.\" Reynolds, 377 U.S. at 565, 84 S.Ct. at 1383. According to theCourt, this \"opportunity for equal participation of all voters\" isguaranteed by the Equal Protection Clause, and, therefore, \"[d]ilutingthe weight of votes because of place of residence impairs basicconstitutional rights under the Fourteenth Amendment.\" Id. at 566, 84S.Ct. at 1384.\n\nApportionment schemes that satisfy the one person, one vote requirementofReynolds are still vulnerable, the Court subsequently held, if they\"operate to dilute or cancel the voting strength of racial or politicalelements.\" Whitcomb, 403 U.S. at 144, 91 S.Ct. at 1869. See also Fortsonv. Dorsey, 379 U.S. 433, 439, 85 S.Ct. 498, 501, 13 L.Ed.2d 401 (1965);Burns v. Richardson, 384 U.S. 73, 89, 86 S.Ct. 1286, 1295, 16 L.Ed.2d 376(1966). In Whitcomb, the residents of a \"ghetto,\" an area within amulti-member state legislative district with a concentrated minoritypopulation, brought an equal protection claim against Indiana'slegislative apportionment scheme. 403 U.S. at 128-29, 91 S.Ct. at 1861.The plaintiffs argued that, under the scheme, the ghetto residents wereunable to elect their own candidates. Id. at 128-29, 91 S.Ct. at1861-62.\n\nThe Supreme Court denied the residents' claim, however, pointing outthat they had not shown that the multi-member district had been\"conceived or operated as [a] purposeful device[] to further racial oreconomic discrimination.\" Id. at 149, 91 S.Ct. at 1872. Moreover, \"thatthe number of ghetto residents who were legislators was not in proportionto ghetto population [does not] satisfactorily prove invidiousdiscrimination absent evidence and findings that ghetto residents hadless opportunity than did other [non-ghetto] residents [who also lived inthe multi-member district] to participate in the political process and toelect legislators of their choice.\" Id. Rather, in order for the schemeto rise to the level of an equal protection violation, it was the ghettoresidents' burden to prove that they were \"not allowed to register orvote, to choose the political party they desired to support, toparticipate in its affairs or to be equally represented on those occasionswhen legislative candidates were chosen.\" Id.\n\nTwo years later, the plaintiffs in White v. Regester met that burden.In White, two different minority groups, blacks and Mexican-Americans,brought equal protection challenges to Texas's legislative apportionmentplan, which placed each group in a separate multi-member district in whichit constituted a minority. 412 U.S. at 758-59, 93 S.Ct. at 2336. Inruling on those claims, the Court reaffirmed the proposition that \"it isnot enough that the [minority] group allegedly discriminated against hasnot had legislative seats in proportion to its voting potential.\" Id. at765-66, 93 S.Ct. at 2339. Rather, it is the plaintiffs' burden to show\"that the political processes leading to nomination and election were notequally open to participation by the group in question — that itsmembers had less opportunity . . . to participate in the politicalprocesses and to elect [candidates] of their choice.\" Id. at 766, 93S.Ct. at 2339.\n\nFor the black plaintiffs, that burden was met with evidence that onlytwo blacks had ever even been slated by the local Democratic party, awhite-dominated organization that \"did not need the support of the Negrocommunity\"; that \"racial campaign tactics\" had been used in whiteprecincts to defeat black candidates of choice; that Texas had a historyof official racial discrimination; and that Texas employed certainelectoral devices, like the majority-vote requirement and the \"placerule,\" which resulted in elections from multi-member districts beingreduced to head-to-head contests for each position. Id. at 766-67, 93S.Ct. at 2339-40. The Mexican-American plaintiffs met their burden withevidence that they typically \"suffer[] a cultural and language barrierthat makes . . . participation in community processes extremelydifficult\"; that \"cultural incompatibility conjoined with the poll taxand the most restrictive voter registration procedures in the nation haveoperated to effectively deny Mexican-Americans access to the politicalprocesses\"; that therewas a history of discrimination againstMexican-Americans, reflected in the fact that voting registration is verylow; and that the local delegation was \"insufficiently responsive toMexican-American interests.\" Id. at 768-69, 93 S.Ct. at 2340-41 (internalfootnotes and punctuation omitted). Weighing all of this together, theCourt held, leads to the conclusion that the multimember district wasdesigned and operated invidiously to exclude these groups fromparticipation in political life. Id. at 767, 769-70, 93 S.Ct. at 2340-41.The proper remedy the district court had fashioned was to divide themulti-member districts into single-member districts in which the minoritygroups could constitute majorities. Id. at 765, 93 S.Ct. at 2339.\n\nFrom the Court's opinion in White, the Fifth Circuit identified inZimmer v. McKeithen, \"a panoply of factors, any number of which maycontribute to the existence of [unconstitutional vote] dilution.\"485 F.2d 1297, 1305 (5th Cir. 1973). Even if racial motivation cannot beproven, plaintiffs can succeed on their vote dilution claim bydemonstrating \"a lack of access to the process of slating candidates, theunresponsiveness of legislators to their particularized interests, atenuous state policy underlying preference for multi-member or at-largedistricting, or that the existence of past discrimination in generalprecludes the effective participation in the election system.\" Id. Theirclaim is enhanced by showing that certain electoral devices, likemajority vote requirements or anti-single shot voting provisions,\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e64\u003c/span\u003ework to the minority's disadvantage. Id.\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e65\u003c/span\u003e\n\nAfter Zimmer was issued, the Supreme Court decided Washington v.Davis, 426 U.S. 229, 96 S.Ct. 2040, 48 L.Ed.2d 597 (1976), and one yearlater, Village of Arlington Heights v. Metropolitan Housing Development,429 U.S. 252, 97 S.Ct. 555, 50 L.Ed.2d 450 (1977). Both cases involvedclaims by racial minorities asserted under the Equal Protection Clause,although neither case arose in the vote dilution context. The Court heldfirst in Davis and then in Arlington Heights that, in order to succeed ona claim brought under the Equal Protection Clause of the FourteenthAmendment, plaintiffs must present proof of racially discriminatoryintent or purpose. Davis, 427 U.S. at 240, 96 S.Ct. at 2048; ArlingtonHeights, 429 U.S. at 265, 97 S.Ct. at 563. The Court recognized that\"[d]etermining whether invidious discriminatory purpose was a motivatingfactor demands a sensitive inquiry into such circumstantial and directevidence of intent as may be available.\" Arlington Heights, 429 U.S. at266, 97 S.Ct. at 564.\n\nThe Fifth Circuit subsequently revised its vote dilution analysis inlight of these cases. In Nevett v. Sides, 571 F.2d 209 (5th Cir. 1978),cert. denied, 446 U.S. 951, 100 S.Ct. 2916, 64 L.Ed.2d 807 (1980), thecourt held that \"a showing of racially motivated discrimination is anecessary element in an equal protection voting dilution claim,\" id. at219, and that this requirement \"may be satisfied by direct orcircumstantial evidence,\" id. at 221. The panoply of factors outlined inZimmer, the court held, is exactly the kind of circumstantial evidencecourts should consider in determining legislative intent, particularlywhen there is no direct evidence. Id. at 222. Indeed, \"a finding ofracially discriminatory dilution under the Zimmer criteria raises aninference of intent and, therefore, . . . a finding under the criteriasatisfies the intent requirement.\" Id. at 217.\n\nMore significantly, the Nevett court streamlined the myriad Zimmerfactors into two: racially polarized bloc voting and lack of governmentresponsiveness to minority needs. Id. at 223. \"When bloc voting has beendemonstrated, a showing under Zimmer that the governing body isunresponsive to minority needs is strongly corroborative of anintentional exploitation of the electorate's bias.\" Id. Bloc voting,according to the court, \"allows representatives to ignore minorityinterests without fear of reprisal at the polls.\" Id. The court furtherexplained that bloc voting may be indicated by a showing under Zimmer of\"the existence of past discrimination in general. . . . large districts,majority vote requirements, anti-single shot voting provisions and thelack of provision for at-large candidates running from particulargeographical subdistricts.\" Id. at 223 n. 18 (quoting Zimmer, 485 F.2d at1305)).\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e66\u003c/span\u003e \"The establishment under Zimmer that blacks have beendenied access to slating, registration, or other aspects of politicalparticipation\" is an explanation of why representatives have ignored blackinterests — \"because blacks cannot achieve the input to which theyare entitled.\" Id. at 223.\n\nOn the same day Nevett was issued, the Fifth Circuit released threeother vote dilution cases brought under the Equal Protection Clause:Bolden v. City of Mobile, 571 F.2d 238 (5th Cir. 1978); Blacks United forLasting Leadership v. City of Shreveport, 571 F.2d 248 (5th Cir. 1978);Thomasville Branch of the NAAACP v. Thomas County, 571 F.2d 257 (5thCir. 1978). In all three cases, the court analyzed the vote dilutionclaims under the newly-announced standard from Nevett. In Bolden, forexample, the court affirmed the district court's finding that the city'sat-large method of electing commissioners diluted the voting strength ofblacks because the district court \"gave careful consideration to each ofthe primary Zimmer criteria.\" Bolden, 571 F.2d at 243. Specifically, thecourt found evidence of racially polarized voting \"of an acute nature,\"preventing any black from ever being elected to the city commission,general unresponsiveness on the part of the city commissioners to theneeds of blacks, a significant history of past discrimination against\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e67\u003c/span\u003eblacks, and the use of various electoral devices, like the majority voterequirement. Id. at 243-44 \"[T]hese findings . . . compel the inferencethat thesystem has been maintained with the purpose of diluting theblack vote, thus supplying the [intent requirement from Davis andArlington Heights].\" Id. at 245.\n\nA plurality of the Supreme Court rejected the Fifth Circuit'seffects-only test under the Equal Protection Clause in City of Mobile v.Bolden. Justice Stewart, writing for the plurality,\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e68\u003c/span\u003e first held thata showing of discriminatory purpose was required to prove vote dilutionunder the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments and even under section 2 ofthe Voting Rights Act of 1965, 42 U.S.C. § 1973.\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e69\u003c/span\u003e Bolden, 446U.S. at 65-66, 70, 100 S.Ct. at 1498-99, 1501. The plurality then notedthat Zimmer was \"decided upon the misunderstanding that it is notnecessary to show a discriminatory purpose in order to prove a violationof the Equal Protection Clause — that proof of discriminatoryeffect is sufficient.\" Bolden, 446 U.S. at 71, 100 S.Ct. at 1501-02. Thelower courts' reliance on Zimmer, according to the plurality, wastherefore improper because the Zimmer criteria alone were \"insufficientto prove an unconstitutionally discriminatory purpose in the presentcase.\" Id. at 73, 100 S.Ct. at 1503.\n\nFour other Justices, however, believed that the evidence offered belowwas sufficient to satisfy the purposeful discrimination standard.\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e70\u003c/span\u003eJustice White, one of the four who found the evidence sufficient, wrote aseparate dissenting opinion expressing his belief that a consideration ofthe factors articulated by the Fifth Circuit in Zimmer was the properapproach in determining whether vote dilution was caused by purposefuldiscrimination. Id. at 101-03, 100 S.Ct. at 1517-18(White, J., dissenting). Justice White pointed out that Zimmer \"articulatedthe very factors deemed relevant by White v. Regester and Whitcombv. Chavis . . . and that both [lower courts] considered these factorswith the recognition that they are relevant only with respect to thequestion whether purposeful discrimination can be inferred.\" Id. at101, 100 S.Ct. at 1517.\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e71\u003c/span\u003e\n\nJustice White persuaded a majority of the Court of his position twoyears later in Rogers v. Lodge.\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e72\u003c/span\u003e In writing for the majority,Justice White acknowledged that, \"[b]ecause the District Court in thepresent case employed the evidentiary factors outlined in Zimmer, it isurged that [the lower court's finding of unconstitutional vote dilution]is infirm for the same reasons that led to the reversal in [Bolden].\"Id. at 620-21, 102 S.Ct. at 3277. The Court, however, disagreed andpointed out that the lower court had relied heavily on Nevett v. Sides, inwhich the Fifth Circuit had required a showing of discriminatory purposeand had held that, \"although the evidentiary factors outlined in Zimmerwere important considerations [in proving intent], the plaintiff is notlimited to those factors.\" Id. at 621, 102 S.Ct. at 3277. This, the Courtheld, was the \"proper legal standard.\" Id. at 622, 102 S.Ct. at 3278.\n\nIn reviewing the application of that standard to the facts, the RogersCourt concluded that the district court properly found unconstitutionalvote dilution. First and foremost, the Court pointed out, \"[t]here was. . . overwhelming evidence of bloc voting along racial lines,\" which,along with evidence that \"no black had ever been elected to the [county][c]ommission[,] . . . bear[s] heavily on the issue of purposefuldiscrimination.\" Rogers, 458 U.S. at 623, 102 S.Ct. at 3279. Like theFifth Circuit in Nevett, the Court explained that \"[v]oting along raciallines allows those elected to ignore black interests without fear ofpolitical consequences, and without bloc voting the minority candidateswould not lose elections solely because of their race.\" Id. Because,however, \"such facts are insufficient in themselves to prove purposefuldiscrimination,\" id. at 624, 102 S.Ct. at 3279, the Court took intoconsideration other findings: the impact of past discrimination on theability of blacks to participate politically, the lack of responsivenesson the part of elected officials to the needs of the black community, andthe use of certain electoral devices that worked to dilute the votingstrength of blacks. Id. at 624-28, 102 S.Ct. at 3279-81.\n\nB. VOTING RIGHTS ACT CASES\n\nOne month before the Supreme Court decided Rogers v. Lodge, Congressamended section 2 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965,42 U.S.C. § 1973.\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e73\u003c/span\u003e \"The amendment was largely a response to [theSupreme] Court's plurality opinion in [Bolden], which had declared that,in order to establish a violation either of section 2 or of theFourteenth or Fifteenth Amendments, minority voters must prove that acontested electoral mechanism was intentionally adopted or maintained bystate officials for a discriminatory purpose.\" Gingles, 478 U.S. at 35,106 S.Ct. at 2758 (internal citations omitted). According to the SupremeCourt's interpretation of the amendment, \"Congress substantially revised[section] 2 to make clear that a violation could be proved by showingdiscriminatory effect alone and to establish as the relevant legalstandard the `results test,' applied by this Court in White v. Regester,and by other federal courts before Bolden.\" Id. (internal citationsomitted).\n\nIndeed, the Senate Judiciary Committee Majority Report that accompaniedthe bill amending section 2 listed \"typical factors\" helpful in proving adiscriminatory effect; the report explicitly mentioned that the factorswere derived from White v. Regester, as refined and developed by theFifth Circuit in Zimmer v. McKeithen.\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e74\u003c/span\u003e See S.REP. 97-417, at 28 n.113 (1982), reprinted in 1982 U.S.C.C.A.N. 177, 206; see also Gingles,478 U.S. at 36 n. 4, 106 S.Ct. at 2759 n. 4. Importantly, among thefactors listed are those on which the Fifth Circuit placed primaryreliance in Nevett, namely \"the extent to which voting . . . is raciallypolarized\" and \"whether there is a significant lack of responsiveness onthe part of elected officials to the [minority group's needs].\" S. REP.97-417, at 28-29 (1982), reprinted in 1982 U.S.C.C.A.N. 177, 206-07.Finally, the amendment incorporated the proposition developing in thecase law with regard to equal protection claims that \"nothing in thissection establishes a right to have members of a protected class electedin numbers equal to their proportion in the population.\"42 U.S.C. § 1973 (b).\n\nGingles prompted the Supreme Court's first interpretation of theamendment to section 2. The Gingles plaintiffs brought a section 2challenge against the inclusion of several multimember state legislativedistricts in North Carolina's redistricting plan. Gingles, 478 U.S. at35, 106 S.Ct. at 2758.\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e75\u003c/span\u003e Upon analyzing the statute, the Courtconfirmed that Congress indeed shifted plaintiffs' burden from provingdiscriminatory intent to showing discriminatory effects: \"The `right'question . . . is `whether as a result of the challenged practice orstructure plaintiffs do not have an equal opportunity to participate inthe political processes and to elect candidates of their choice.'\"Gingles, 478 U.S. at 44, 106 S.Ct. at 2763 (quoting S. REP. 97-417, at 28(1982), reprinted in 1982 U.S.C.C.A.N. 177, 206).\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e76\u003c/span\u003e Proving thedenial of the ability to participate in the political process and toelect candidates of choice, the Court held, required more than a mereshowing of the factors enunciated in Zimmer v. McKeithen and listed inthe Senate Report. Id. at 48, 106 S.Ct. at 2765. \"While many or all of[those] factors . . . may be relevant . . . unless there is a conjunctionof the following circumstances, the use of multi-member districtsgenerally will not impede the ability of minority voters to electrepresentatives of their choice\": (1) the minority group \"is sufficientlylarge and geographically compact to constitute a majority in asingle-member district\"; (2) the minority group is \"politicallycohesive\"; and (3) the majority group \"votes sufficiently as a bloc toenable it . . . usually to defeat the minority's preferred candidate.\"Id. at 48-51, 106 S.Ct. at 2765-67.\n\nAccording to the Court, these three circumstances are \"necessarypreconditions\" to a vote dilution claim. Id. at 50, 106 S.Ct. at 2766. Ifa minority group cannot demonstrate its geographic compactness, forexample, then \"the multi-member form of the district cannot beresponsible for minority voters' inability to elect its [sic]candidates.\" Id. (emphasis in original).That is to say, \"if the minoritygroup is spread evenly throughout the multimember district, or if,although geographically compact, the minority group is so small inrelation to the surrounding white population that it could not constitutea majority in a single-member district, these minority voters cannotmaintain that they would have been able to elect representatives of theirchoice in the absence of the multimember electoral structure.\" Id. at 50n. 17, 106 S.Ct. at 2766 n. 17. The purpose of inquiring into the secondand third preconditions, which together demonstrate racially polarizedvoting, is similarly used to establish that it is the electoral structureitself which actually \"thwarts distinctive minority group interests\" and\"impedes its ability to elect its chosen representatives.\" Id. at 51, 106S.Ct. at 2766-67. Thus, the confluence of the three Gingles preconditionsestablishes a causal link between the challenged electoral scheme and thevote dilution injury plaintiffs allege.\n\nIn a subsequent case, Johnson v. DeGrandy, the Court explained that thethree Gingles preconditions, while necessary to prove a section 2 claim,are not sufficient. 512 U.S. 997, 1011, 114 S.Ct. 2647, 2657, 129 L.Ed.2d775 (1994). This was true in Gingles \"because the ultimate conclusionsabout equality or inequality of [a minority group's political]opportunity were intended by Congress to be judgments resting oncomprehensive, not limited, canvassing of relevant facts.\" Id. Courts,therefore, after determining that the three Gingles preconditions exist,should then \"examine other evidence in the totality of thecircumstances, including the extent of the opportunities minority votersenjoy to participate in the political processes.\" Id. at 1011-12, 114S.Ct. at 2657; see also Gingles, 478 U.S. at 80, 106 S.Ct. at 2781(citing the district court's findings under the totality of thecircumstances test, specifically, \"the legacy of official discriminationin voting matters, education, housing, employment, and health services;and the persistence of campaign appeals to racial prejudice\"); Negron v.City of Miami Beach, 113 F.3d 1563, 1566 (11th Cir. 1997) (holding thatthe Gingles preconditions are \"not the end of the story\").\n\nC. POLITICAL GERRYMANDERING\n\nApplying the Gingles factors to political gerrymandering claimsprovides the most intelligible way of determining which claims present anEqual Protection Clause violation. The basic test for these claims, asset forth by the Court in Bandemer, requires plaintiffs to establish alegislature's discriminatory intent in redistricting and a history (pastor predicted) of actual adverse effects resulting from that intent.Bandemer, 478 U.S. at 127, 139, 106 S.Ct. at 2808, 2814. This test istherefore merely a restatement of the test established in the racial votedilution cases explored above. As in the racial cases, Bandemer instructsthat the focus of our inquiry should be an examination of the effects— specifically, \"whether a particular group has beenunconstitutionally denied its chance to effectively influence thepolitical process.\" Id. at 132-33, 106 S.Ct. at 2810. As we explainbelow, the three Gingles factors are necessary preconditions to anyshowing of this effect by a political group. We therefore hold that inorder to succeed on a claim of political gerrymandering brought under theEqual Protection Clause, a political group must first set forth evidenceof (1) geographical compactness, (2) political cohesiveness of thatgroup, and (3) bloc voting on the part of the majority group.\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e77\u003c/span\u003eGingles, 478 U.S. at 50-51, 106 S.Ct. at 2766. Furthermore, wehold that once these three factors are satisfied, the plaintiffs must thenestablish (4) that the totality of the circumstances indicates votedilution. DeGrandy, 512 U.S. at 1011-12, 114 S.Ct. at 2657.\n\n1. RATIONALE\n\nWe adopt the standards of Gingles and DeGrandy to our analysis of theinstant equal protection claim for four reasons. First, without aninitial showing of the three factors discussed in Gingles, a plaintiffcannot demonstrate that any adverse effect actually results from thechallenged legislation, no matter what other circumstantial factors ofvote dilution may be alleged. See Gingles, 478 U.S. at 48-50, 106 S.Ct.at 2765-66. It is, of course, axiomatic that a plaintiff claiming aviolation of his equal protection rights must prove that his injury iscaused by the challenged government action. The confluence of the threeGingles factors demonstrates that the minority group has the potential,absent discriminatory interference from the majority group, toparticipate in the political process and that it is the discriminatoryinterference which prevents the minority group from doing so and therebycauses its injury. See id. at 50 n. 17, 106 S.Ct. at 2767 n. 17.\n\nThe requirement of causation as an element of a Fourteenth Amendmentvote dilution claim was expressly recognized by the Eleventh Circuit inJohnson v. DeSoto County Board of Commissioners, 204 F.3d 1335, 1345-46(11th Cir. 2000). In DeSoto, the court held that a constitutional votedilution claim is made out upon a showing that \"(1) the county's blackpopulation lacks an equal opportunity to participate in the politicalprocess and elect candidates of its choice; (2) this inequality ofopportunity results from the county's at-large voting scheme; and (3) aracially discriminatory purpose underlies [that] scheme.\" Id. at 1345.The court, recognizing that this test may appear to depart from precedentrequiring merely a showing of discriminatory effects plus intent,cautioned that no such change was in fact intended. Id. at 1345 n. 20.Rather than adding a causation element to the test, the court held that\"the `discriminatory effects' requirement encompasses both inequality ofopportunity and a causation element.\" Id. The separation of thesesubcomponents into separate elements was merely done to \"promote[]clarity.\" Id. Similarly, here, we do not seek to change thewell-developed standards governing constitutional vote dilution claims.We merely recognize the burden placed on plaintiffs of establishing acausal link between their injury and the challenged legislation and adopta standard by which a court can determine whether the plaintiffs haveborne this burden.\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e78\u003c/span\u003e\n\nSecond, although political cohesiveness, bloc voting, and geographiccompactness were specified as preconditions to claims brought undersection 2 of the Voting Rights Act in Gingles, they have always figuredprominently in the analysis of vote dilution claims brought under theEqual Protection Clause. See, e.g., Rogers, 458U.S. at 623, 102 S.Ct. at3279 (recognizing the importance of proof of bloc voting — \"withoutbloc voting the minority candidates would not lose elections solelybecause of their race.\"); id. at 616, 102 S.Ct. at 3275 (recognizingdilution occurs where a \"distinct minority\" would otherwise be able toelect a representative in a single-member district but is insteadsubmerged in a multimember district characterized by bloc voting);Nevett, 571 F.2d at 223 n. 16 (\"In the absence of polarized voting, blackcandidates could not be denied office because they were black, and a caseof unconstitutional dilution could not be made.\"). In fact, thecongressional amendment to section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, whichprecipitated the Court's holding in Gingles, merely codified the standardsthat had been developed for testing racial vote dilution claims broughtunder the Equal Protection Clause in Whitcomb and White. See S. REP.97-417, at 28 (1982), reprinted in 1982 U.S.C.C.A.N. 177, 206 (adoptingthe results test of Whitcomb and White and rejecting the intent test ofBolden). The result is that the same \"general standard, governing proofof injury, [controls] both section 2 and constitutional vote dilutioncases.\" DeSoto, 204 F.3d at 1344. Just as the Gingles factors wereimported into the section 2 context from the Court's constitutional votedilution jurisprudence, so, too, is it now reasonable to bring them backto our equal protection analysis.\n\nThird, it is only logical to conclude that if the Gingles factors arerequired of racial groups seeking to succeed on statutory vote dilutionclaims, so, too, must they be required of political groups seeking tosucceed on similar constitutional claims. To hold otherwise would be torender it easier for a political group than for a racial minority toobtain protection from electoral discrimination. In other words, such arule would make political groups more equal than racial groups. The EqualProtection Clause simply makes no room for such a holding. See Zobel v.Williams, 457 U.S. 55, 71, 102 S.Ct. 2309, 2319, 72 L.Ed.2d 672 (1982)(Brennan, J., concurring).\n\nFourth and finally, the language of Bandemer itself necessitates proofof the three Gingles factors. The plurality requires proof of (1)\"intentional discrimination against an identifiable political group\" and(2) \"an actual discriminatory effect on that group.\" Bandemer, 478 U.S.at 127, 106 S.Ct. at 2808 (emphasis added). The reality of Americanpolitics is that \"voters sometimes prefer Democratic candidates, andsometimes Republican,\" without regard to the party affiliation noted ontheir voter registration cards. Id. at 135, 106 S.Ct. at 2812. Toidentify the members of any one political group, plaintiffs musttherefore provide proof of more than just party registration. As JusticeStevens recognized in his concurrence to Bolden, \"[i]t is only when [agroup's] common interests are strong enough to be manifested in politicalaction that the need [for protection against gerrymandering] arises. Forthe political strength of a group . . . is a function of numbers —specifically the number of persons who will vote in the same way.\" 446U.S. at 88, 100 S.Ct. at 1511 (Stevens, J., concurring in judgment). Inthe political gerrymandering context, the best evidence of politicalidentity will thus necessarily consist of proof of bloc voting andpolitical cohesiveness.\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e79\u003c/span\u003e These factorsare the \"glue\" that bindstogether voters and makes them an identifiable political group.\n\nAs with claims of racially polarized voting, establishing politicallypolarized voting requires both a showing of political cohesiveness amongmembers of the minority political group and a showing of bloc voting bythe majority group. Gingles, 478 U.S. at 56, 106 S.Ct. at 2769. Theseelements, in turn, may most easily be established by a showing that themembers of each group tend to vote for the same candidate and that thecandidate supported by each group is different from that supported by theother. Id. This examination requires evidence of cohesiveness and blocvoting over some significant period of time\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e80\u003c/span\u003e and may not besatisfied merely with proof of the minority party's actual or predictedloss in a single election. Id. at 56, 106 S.Ct. at 2769. Likewise, thesuccess of the minority party in one election will not defeat a claim ofpolarized voting. Id. at 57, 106 S.Ct. at 2770.\n\nof course, once the identifiable political group has demonstrated,through evidence of these three preconditions, that they have thepotential to participate as a group in the political process and electlegislators of their choice, they must also establish the intent andactual effects elements expressly required under Bandemer and all votedilution claims brought under the Equal Protection Clause.\n\n2. INTENT \u0026 EFFECT\n\nThe Bandemer plurality's analysis of the first prong of its two-steptest, the intent requirement, sets a low bar for plaintiffs assertingpolitical gerrymandering claims. Recognizing the reality that \"whenever alegislature redistricts, those responsible for the legislation will knowthe likely political composition of the new districts and will have aprediction as to whether a particular district is a safe one for aDemocratic or Republican candidate or is a competitive district thateither candidate might win,\" Bandemer, 478 U.S. at 128, 106 S.Ct. at2808, the Court concluded that \"it should not be very difficult to provethat the likely political consequences of the reapportionment wereintended,\" id. at 129, 106 S.Ct. at 2809. However, the Court was carefulto point out that just because it should not be difficult to provepolitically discriminatory intent in challenges to legislativeredistricting \"does not, of course, mean that it need not be proved atall to succeed on such a claim.\" Id. at 129 n. 11, 106 S.Ct. at 2809n.ll.\n\nThe Bandemer plaintiffs established this element to the satisfaction ofthe district court, which emphasized the testimony of the Speaker of theIndiana House in its decision finding in favor of the plaintiffs on thepolitical gerrymandering claim. Bandemer v. Davis, 603 F. Supp. 1479, 1484(S.D. Ind. 1984). The Republican Speaker provided direct evidence of thisintent, admitting that the reasons for structuring certain districts were\"[p]olitical\" and that the Republicans who drew those districts \"wantedto save as many incumbent Republicans as possible.\" Id. The SupremeCourt upheld the district court's determination of discriminatory intentas not clearly erroneous. Bandemer, 478 U.S. at 127, 106 S.Ct. at 2808.\n\nThe Court then proceeded to examine the adverse effects imposed uponthe political minority by the redistricting plan. As in the racial votedilution cases, the focus of this examination was on determining whetheror not the challenged legislation operated \"to cancel out or minimize thevoting strength\" of Indiana Democrats. White, 412 U.S. at 765, 93 S.Ct.at 2339. Thus, as in the racial cases, the Court was looking for proofthat Democrats had been fenced out of the political process; in otherwords, that they \"had less opportunity than did other residents in thedistrict to participate in the political processes and to electlegislators of their choice.\" Id. at 766, 93 S.Ct. at 2339 (citingWhitcomb, 403 U.S. at 149-50, 91 S.Ct. at 1872). Since Bandemer does notexplicitly establish the proof required to show a fencing out of onepolitical party by another in the voting context, we look to theplurality's opinion and the cases it relies on for the necessaryelaboration.\n\nFirst, the Court was explicit in squarely rejecting any possibilitythat \"a reapportionment law would violate the Equal Protection Clausebecause the voters in the losing party do not have representation in thelegislature in proportion to the statewide vote received by their partycandidates.\" Bandemer, 478 U.S. at 130, 106 S.Ct. at 2809. That more isrequired than a mere showing of disproportionate election results toestablish an equal protection violation is well established in the lineof racial vote dilution cases, see, e.g., Whitcomb, 403 U.S. at 160, 91S.Ct. at 1878, and was also held to apply to claims brought under section2 of the Voting Rights Act, see Gingles, 478 U.S. at 57, 106 S.Ct. at2769. This remains true even where disproportionate results are gross orpersist year after year; the Court has \"not yet deemed it a denial ofequal protection to deny legislative seats to losing candidates, even inthose so-called `safe' districts where the same party wins year afteryear.\" Whitcomb, 403 U.S. at 153, 91 S.Ct. at 1874. As a result, wheregroups cannot present evidence of \"fencing out\" beyond meredisproportion, we can only conclude that \"the failure of the [minority]to have legislative seats in proportion to its populations [is more] afunction of losing elections than of built-in bias against [that party]\"and no equal protection claim may lie. Id.\n\nThat is not to say that a history — \"actual or projected\"— of disproportionate results is wholly irrelevant to the ultimateinquiry. On the contrary, the Bandemer Court explicitly recognized itsrelevance; however, it is only where such history is accompanied by\"strong indicia of lack of political power and the denial of fairrepresentation\" that a claim of political vote dilution may succeed. 478U.S. at 139, 106 S.Ct. at 2814. In other words, election results are butone inconclusive part of the ultimate showing — whether theminority party has been \"denied its chance to effectively influence thepolitical process.\" Id. at 132-33, 106 S.Ct. at 2810.\n\nIn addition to past or projected election results, therefore,plaintiffs must come forward with other evidence that their minority partyhad experienced a \"less[er] opportunity to participate in the politicalprocesses and to elect candidates of their choice.\" Id. at 131, 106 S.Ct.at 2809 (quoting Rogers, 458 U.S. at 624, 102 S.Ct. at 3279). The Courtarrived at this standard by distilling its precedent in racial votedilution cases involving individual multimember districts. See id. Thisindication of vote dilution, the Court held, \"would apply equally toclaims by politicalgroups in individual districts,\" id. at 131 n. 12,106 S.Ct. at 2810 n. 12, and to claims of statewide politicalgerrymandering, see id. at 132, 106 S.Ct. at 2810.\n\nThe same race-based cases from which the Court derived the standard ofvote dilution — the diminishment of a group's opportunity toparticipate in the political process and elect candidates of its choice— also provide us with a framework for evaluating proof of thateffect. See, e.g., Rogers, 458 U.S. at 624, 102 S.Ct. at 3279; UnitedJewish Org's v. Carey, 430 U.S. 144, 167-68, 97 S.Ct. 996, 1010-11, 51L.Ed.2d 229 (1977); White, 412 U.S. at 765-66, 93 S.Ct. at 2339;Whitcomb, 403 U.S. at 149-50, 91 S.Ct. at 1872. Those cases instruct usto look beyond evidence of numerosity and geographic compactness and blocvoting to other evidence that, in the totality of the circumstances,supports an ultimate determination that legislation causesunconstitutional vote dilution. See, e.g., Rogers, 458 U.S. at 624, 102S.Ct. at 3279. In our examination of the totality of the circumstances,the Court directs us to the factors developed by the Fifth Circuit inZimmer and Nevett.\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e81\u003c/span\u003e See id.\n\nInterestingly, the Court in Bandemer stresses only one of the Zimmerfactors — \"the lack of responsiveness by those elected to theconcerns of the relevant groups.\" Bandemer, 478 U.S. at 131, 106 S.Ct. at2810. While the Court acknowledged, at least in passing, the otherfactors traditionally considered in vote dilution cases, the Courtrecognized that political minorities would be less able to establish manyof the types of circumstantial evidence of vote dilution often alleged byracial minorities. Id. at 131 n. 12, 106 S.Ct. at 2810 n. 12.Specifically, the Court recognized that political minorities would likelynot be able to point to a past pattern of exclusion from the voting boothand political office to support their dilution claims. Id. Not only willmany of the other Zimmer factors be difficult for political parties toestablish, the most likely cause for concern among members of theminority party will be that the elected representative is or will beunresponsive to their concerns.\n\nAlthough evidence of lack of responsiveness may be asserted more easilythan other factors, it is unclear how that would be shown in thepolitical gerrymandering context. The Bandemer plurality clearly instructsthat we may not presume that Republicans have been or will be deaf to theconcerns of the Democrats. On the contrary, \"a group of individuals whovotes for a losing candidate is usually deemed to be adequatelyrepresented by the winning candidate and to have as much opportunity toinfluence that candidate as other voters in the district.\" Id. at 132,106 S.Ct. at 2810.\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e82\u003c/span\u003e It has likewise long been accepted that \"[t]hemere fact that one interest group or another . . . has found itselfoutvoted and without legislative seats of its own provides no basis forinvoking constitutional remedies where . . . there is no indication thatthis segment of the population is being denied access to the politicalsystem.\" Whitcomb, 403 U.S. at 154-55, 91 S.Ct. at 1875.\n\nThe bar to establishing lack of responsiveness will only be heightenedwhen the challenged redistricting is of congressional districts. Membersof Congress, unlike state and local representatives, are notengaged in the business of providing constituents with government services,such as fire and police protection, schools, utilities, and roadimprovements. Where a state or local body refuses to provide one group withsuch services, the evidence of lack of responsiveness will be apparent. SeeRogers, 458 U.S. at 626, 102 S.Ct. at 3280. To allege that a member ofCongress is being unresponsive to one political group or the other, onthe other hand, is to claim that he is failing to promote that group'spolitical views. As with any minority in our democratic system founded onmajority rule, the rejection of its views could not raise constitutionalconcerns. To hold otherwise would be tantamount to holding that \"it isinvidiously discriminatory for a [political subdivision] to elect itsdelegation by a majority vote based on party or candidate platforms andso to some extent predetermine legislative votes on particular issues.\"Whitcomb, 403 U.S. at 155, 91 S.Ct. at 1875. That the majority may rejectthe views of the minority is \"inherent in government by electedrepresentatives.\" Id.\n\nFinally, even if one political party could establish a history ofdisproportionate results in conjunction with some other evidence in thetotality of the circumstances of unconstitutional vote dilution, no groupwill be able to prove a lack of ability to participate in the politicalprocess. Any such claim will necessarily be refuted by the logicalinference to be drawn from a disparity between voting age population andregistered voters or between registered voters and voter turnout. The waypolitical groups participate in the process is by registering voters andpersuading them to support their policies and candidates. A failure to dothese things will be the actual cause of any inability on the group'spart to elect candidates of its choice and have those candidates representits interests.\n\nD. RULE APPLICATION\n\nTurning now to the case at bar, we analyze the evidence offered by theplaintiffs and intervenors to determine whether it rises to the level ofproof sufficient to make out an equal protection claim — that is,whether the evidence demonstrates \"both intentional discriminationagainst an identifiable political group and an actual discriminatoryeffect on that group.\" Bandemer, 478 U.S. at 127, 106 S.Ct. at 2808.\n\n1. INTENT\n\nLike the Court in Bandemer, we have no trouble at all finding that theintent of the Florida legislature, comprised of a majority ofRepublicans, was to draw the congressional districts in a way thatadvantages Republican incumbents and potential candidates. Indeed, attrial, the defendants stipulated as much. Moreover, the Bandemer Courtmade clear that, \"[a]s long as redistricting is done by a legislature, itshould not be very difficult to prove that the likely politicalconsequences of the reapportionment were intended.\" Id. at 129, 106S.Ct. at 2809.\n\n2. EFFECTS\n\nWe do not accept, however, the plaintiffs' and intervenors' argumentsthat the effect of the redistricting scheme is \"sufficiently serious torequire intervention by the federal courts.\" Id. at 134, 106 S.Ct. at2811. In particular, these parties have failed to prove that FloridaDemocrats will have \"less opportunity to participate in the politicalprocesses and to elect candidates of their choice\" in congressionaldistricts as a result of the enacted redistricting plan. Id. at 131, 106S.Ct. at 2809 (quoting Rogers, 458 U.S. at 624, 102 S.Ct. at 3279).\n\na. GINGLES PRECONDITIONS\n\nAs we have explained, we must begin our analysis with a considerationof the three Gingles preconditions — geographic compactness,political cohesiveness, and bloc voting on behalf of the majority group.To properly consider these factors, however, we must first understand thepolitical group to whom they apply. In their complaints, the plaintiffsand intervenors identify the relevant group in several ways: \"registeredDemocrats,\" \"members of the Florida Democratic Party,\" and \"Democraticvoters.\"\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e83\u003c/span\u003e At trial, the parties submitted evidence of the number ofregistered Democrats in each congressional district as well asinformation about various elections, indicating how many voters actuallyvoted Democratic. It is unclear to us which group the complaining partieswould have us consider — registered Democrats or those voters whoconsistently vote Democratic. Thus, we take each group in turn because,as we demonstrate, registered Democrats and true Democratic voters arenot necessarily the same in the State of Florida.\n\nIn treating registered Democrats as the identifiable political group,the plaintiffs and intervenors offer only that Democrats make up a slightmajority of registered voters statewide but a minority of registeredvoters in fifteen — well over half — of the proposedcongressional districts.\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e84\u003c/span\u003eThus, they claim, the gerrymanderingunderlying the enacted plan unconstitutionally dilutes the votingstrength of registered Democrats. This assumption is not trustworthy,however, without proof that registered Democrats are politicallycohesive. In other words, simply showing that registered Republicansoutnumber registered Democrats — even in a great majority of thedistricts — does not prove that Democrats will always lose, muchless prove that Democrats can no longer influence the political process.\n\nIndeed, the evidence demonstrates that registered Democrats are not apolitically cohesive group because they often vote Republican. Over thelast decade, for example, a plurality of the registered voters in CDs 1,6, 10, 12, and 22, was Democratic, but Republican candidates wereelected.\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e85\u003c/span\u003e The starkest example is CD 12 (as drawn in 1996), in whichregistered Democrats have outnumbered Republicans at least since 1996 byan average of 49.2% Democrat to 38.5% Republican. In the three mostrecent general elections forCongress, however, Republican candidateshave won — Charles Canady winning by a wide margin in 1996 withalmost 66.6% of the vote and again in 1998 with 100% of the vote, andAdam Putnam winning safely in 2000 with 57% of the vote. Statewide,registered Democrats are likewise unpredictable, often voting forRepublicans. For example, in the race for State Treasurer, a low-profilerace between two non-incumbents, the Republican candidate won by a marginof 18%. In another low-profile, state-wide 1992 race, the Republicancandidate for State Comptroller, Bob Milligan, defeated the six-term,Democratic incumbent by a slight margin. Four years later, Milligan beatthe Democratic candidate by 21.2%.\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e86\u003c/span\u003e Without proof that registeredDemocrats are politically cohesive, we simply cannot assume otherwise.\n\nIt is much more likely, therefore, that the plaintiffs' andintervenors' claim was asserted on behalf of true Democrats — thosevoters who consistently vote Democratic.\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e87\u003c/span\u003e In attempting to identifythis group, the plaintiffs and intervenors submitted evidence of a \"partyvoting index, \" computed from twenty-three state-wide general electioncontests from 1992 through 2000.\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e88\u003c/span\u003e For each election the Republicanand Democratic share of the two-party vote within a given district wascomputed; these vote percentages were then averaged over the twenty-threeelections to yield a broadly based index of the voting tendency of anygiven district. Overall, the mean voting index for the entire state ofFlorida is 49.0% Republican and 51.0% Democratic. Nevertheless, under thenewly enacted plan, eighteen of the districts have an average Republicanvote share over 50%, and only seven have a Democratic vote shareexceeding 50%. This disparity, argue the plaintiffs and intervenors, isunconstitutional.\n\nThe voting index, however, does not prove that there is actually agroup of true Democrats who consistently vote Democratic.\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e89\u003c/span\u003e Indeed,the index does not identify a group of voters at all; it merely reflectsa result without explaining which voters produced that result. It is notnecessarily true, for example, that the voters who voted for Democrats(or Republicans) in a given election were the same people voting forDemocrats (or Republicans) in other elections. It is quite possible thatthe group of voters on one side of thepolitical fence in one electionwill be on the opposite side in the next election. Thus, asserting thatin District 22 the average Democratic vote share was 56.3% does notnecessarily mean that 56.3% of voters in that district consistently voteDemocratic.\n\nEven if the voting index could be tied to an identifiable group ofvoters, it is unreliable in proving political cohesiveness because itdoes not include congressional races — the very races that are mostrelevant in this case. For example, the vote index shows that, inDistricts 10 and 22, the average Democratic vote share exceeds 50%,which, according to the plaintiffs and intervenors, means that aDemocratic candidate will win.\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e90\u003c/span\u003e Over the last decade, however, ineach of those districts, a Republican candidate has won the congressionalgeneral election.\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e91\u003c/span\u003e Conversely, in Districts 1 and 15, two districtsthat, according to the vote index, should perform for a Republicancandidate, Democratic congressional representatives have beenelected.\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e92\u003c/span\u003e If the voting index demonstrates what theplaintiffs and intervenors claim — that each voting averagerepresents a group of voters that consistently votes for thatparty — then the candidates in the four aforementioned districtscould not possibly have been elected. That they were elected proves thatthe voting index is unreliable: voters often cross-over and vote forcandidates of other parties.\n\nThe plaintiffs and intervenors simply have not shown the politicalcohesiveness of an identifiable political group. At times, theyidentified a group — registered Democrats — but failed toestablish the group's political cohesiveness. At other times, theysubmitted election results, typical proof of political cohesiveness, butfailed to identify the group that produced those results. Without proofof cohesiveness, however, the parties' claim must fail because \"it cannotbe said that the [redistricting scheme] thwarts distinctive minoritygroup interests.\" Gingles, 478 U.S. at 51, 106 S.Ct. at 2766.\n\nEven if it is assumed that such evidence demonstrates apolitically-cohesive group of true Democrats, we nonetheless find that theparties' claim fails primarily because there is so little evidence ofgeographic compactness. That is to say, the parties have not shown usthat the true Democrats are situated in compact areas so that we mayredraw the districts in their favor. Without proof of compactness, thereis no way for us to fashion aremedy, even if the parties prevail on theother two Gingles preconditions. See id. at 50 n. 17, 106 S.Ct. at 2766n. 17. The only evidence submitted on this point was through thetestimony of Congressman Peter Deutsch, who testified that there is onearea near Tampa Bay with a high percentage of true Democrats. Accordingto Congressman Deutsch, the legislature plotted the lines in such a waythat 69,909 residents (of whom almost all were black Democrats) were putinto District 11, thereby removing a sufficient number of Democraticvoters from District 10 to restore a Republican margin in the 10thDistrict and packing Democrats into already-Democratic District 11.\n\nCongressman Deutsch's testimony, however, highlights only one smallarea in the entire state where Democrats are geographically compact.\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e93\u003c/span\u003eThere was no similar showing with regard to the other five or sodistricts the plaintiffs and intervenors claim are manipulated in theRepublican Party's favor. Moreover, the plaintiffs and intervenorssubmitted no evidence indicating where true Republicans reside nor howlines could be drawn in a way to pack those Republicans and disperseDemocrats, thereby giving Democrats more districts. Just as courts havelong held in the racial vote dilution cases, we find that, without moredemonstrations like the one Congressman Deutsch made, there is no way forus to cure the very gerrymandering about which the parties complain.\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e94\u003c/span\u003e\n\nFinally, we note that the plaintiffs' and intervenors' claim must failbecause there was no proof that the majority group, presumablyRepublicans, consistently vote as a bloc to defeat Democraticcandidates. Such a showing is imperative in demonstrating that \"[theredistricting scheme] impedes [true Democrats'] ability to elect [their]chosen representatives.\" Gingles, 478 U.S. at 51, 106 S.Ct. at 2767. Theonly evidence submitted was information about registered Republicans andthe voting index for \"Republicans.\" For all the reasons previouslyarticulated, however, such evidence is insufficient proof thatRepublicans — whether registered Republicans or \"true\" Republicans— is an identifiable political group that consistently votes as abloc. Without such evidence, we cannot assume that, just because trueDemocrats may be a minority group, they will most often lose. It may verywell be that the majority group is politically fractured, with voterssometimes voting Republican, Democrat, or Independent.\n\nb. TOTALITY OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES\n\nEven if the plaintiffs and intervenors had successfully establishedthat true Democrats are geographically compact and politically cohesiveand that Republicansvote as a bloc to defeat their candidates, theirclaim fails because they have not shown that, under the totality of thecircumstances, the redistricting scheme gives true Democrats \"lessopportunity to participate in the political processes and to electcandidates of their choice.\" Bandemer, 478 U.S. at 131, 106 S.Ct. at 2809(quoting Rogers, 458 U.S. at 624, 102 S.Ct. at 3279).\n\nIn particular, there has been no evidence regarding true Democrats'inaccessibility to political processes (such as the slating ofcandidates), the weight of the state policy behind the redistrictingscheme,\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e95\u003c/span\u003e nor the effect of past discrimination on true Democrats'ability to participate in the election system. Finally, as we predictedin subpart III.C.2, the plaintiffs and intervenors submitted no evidenceto prove that Republican representatives are unresponsive to the\"particularized interests\" of true Democrats.\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e96\u003c/span\u003e\n\nOn the contrary, a review of the totality of the circumstances revealsa proposition quite opposite the one argued by the plaintiffs andintervenors: true Florida Democrats possess — and will continue topossess — just as much influence over the political process asFlorida Republicans. Indeed, in the state of Florida, there is a totalvoting age population of roughly 12,338,395, of whom only 8,880,396\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e97\u003c/span\u003eare registered to vote. The plaintiffs and intervenors have offerednothing to explain why they cannot influence these 3,457,999 potentialvoters to register as Democrats and consistently vote Democratic. of theeighteen districts that the plaintiffs and intervenors contend willperform for a Republican candidate, all eighteen districts have a gapbetween voting age population and registered voters significant enough tomake a difference for the Democratic Party. If the plaintiffs andintervenors are as motivated to go out in the hustings andgarner more voters as they are to litigate this case, then the outcomeof future congressional elections is by no means certain.\n\nEven those voters who have registered with one party and consistentlyvote for that party are convertible. Political affiliation, unlike race,is not static. In this democracy of ours, where the right to speak andassociate is heavily protected, groups are able to communicate theirviews and persuade others to join them. Indeed, the Florida RepublicanParty appears to have done just that in the last decade. In 1992, forexample, the Florida legislature was dominated by Democrats, with a 61.6%majority in the Florida House and a 52.5% majority in the FloridaSenate. Ten years later, however, that political make-up flip-flopped, asvoters began to elect more Republicans. Today, the Florida House is 64.1%Republican and the Florida Senate is 62.5% Republican.\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e98\u003c/span\u003e\n\n3. PLAINTIFF'S \"Too FAR\" ARGUMENT\n\nThe plaintiffs and intervenors, however, submit that the redistrictingscheme here is unconstitutional because \"[i]n [Bandemer], the partisanbias was not as extreme and the projected duration not as long as theyare in this case.\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e99\u003c/span\u003e Essentially, theycontend that the enactedredistricting plan violates the Equal Protection Clause because itsdiscriminatory effects are greater than the reapportionment plan at issuein Bandemer. The primary support for this assertion is the disparitybetween Republican and Democratic districts. In the State of Florida,where the partisan division is near 50/50, they argue, the redistrictingplan is unconstitutional because 18 of the proposed districts have anaverage Republican vote share over 50%; whereas, the average Democraticvote share exceeds 50% in only seven of the proposed districts. At oralargument, counsel for plaintiff-intervenor Congressman Deutsch urged usto establish the \"belt line,\" a point at which disproportionaterepresentation goes \"too far\" in this case and becomes unconstitutional.In the instant case, counsel presumably contends, the 18/7 ratio exceedsthat line.\n\nWe fail to see how this argument is any different from the oneexplicitly rejected by the Court in Bandemer and in just about everyother racial vote dilution case the Court has heard. \"Our cases . . .clearly foreclose any claim that the Constitution requires proportionalrepresentation or that legislatures in reapportioning must draw districtlines to come as near as possible to allocating seats to the contendingparties in proportion to what their anticipated statewide vote will be.\"Bandemer, 478 U.S. at 130, 106 S.Ct. at 2809 (citing Whitcomb, 403 U.S.at 153, 156, 160, 91 S.Ct. at 1874, 1876, 1876, and White, 412 U.S. at765-66, 93 S.Ct. at 624, 102 S.Ct. at 3279). Notwithstanding theplaintiffs' and intervenors' contention, disproportionate representation— no matter how severe — cannot by itself rise to the levelof an equal protection claim. \"Only where there is evidence that excludedgroups have \"less opportunity to participate in the political processesand to elect candidates of their choice' \"may we refuse to approve theredistricting scheme. Id. at 131, 106 S.Ct. at 2809 (quoting Rogers, 458U.S. at 624, 102 S.Ct. at 3279). \"[W]e have found equal protectionviolations only where a history of disproportionate results appeared inconjunction with strong indicia of lack of political power and the denialof fair representation.\" Id. at 139, 106 S.Ct. at 2814.\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, we deny the plaintiffs' and intervenors'claims of political gerrymandering.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nAs explained above, we conclude that the plaintiffs and intervenorshave failed to establish their claims. Final judgments will be issuedseparately.\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003e1. Plaintiffs brought their claims, the case was tried, and thisopinion was drafted in substantial part prior to the November 2002elections. Some of the references in this opinion are to circumstances asthey existed prior to those elections. To our knowledge, none of ourfindings as drafted prior to the November 2002 elections are inconsistentwith anything that occurred in those elections.\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003e2. In this order we use \"black\" as shorthand for the census categoryin which respondents identify themselves as \"Black, African Am. orNegro.\" We use \"black\" rather than \"African American\" to avoid anyconfusion regarding whether blacks who immigrated (or whose ancestorsimmigrated) to the United States from places other than Africa —for example, Haiti — are included; they are.\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003e3. Initially, plaintiffs also claimed vote dilution based on nationalorigin; plaintiffs claimed the legislature intentionally favoredHispanics of Cuban descent against other Hispanics, diluting the votes ofnon-Cuban Hispanics. In fact, the software used in the reapportionmentprocess did not even track data on whether Hispanics in any area wereCuban or non-Cuban. If, as plaintiffs assert, a higher percentage ofCuban than non-Cuban Hispanics were included in performing Hispanicdistricts, the cause was geography or politics, not discrimination. CubanHispanics in south Florida are more concentrated geographically (and thusmore likely to be included in performing Hispanic districts), whilenon-Cuban Hispanics are more widely dispersed. In addition, a higherpercentage of Cuban than non-Cuban Hispanics vote Republican, so thatefforts to draw Hispanic districts-in a manner favoring Republicans mightwell result in the inclusion of more Cuban than non-Cuban Hispanics insuch districts — because of politics, not national origin. In anyevent, plaintiffs now acknowledge that there is no evidence that anyconstitutionally-permissible alternative could be drawn that wouldmeaningfully improve the relative treatment of Cuban and non-CubanHispanics. Plaintiffs no longer seek relief on this basis and thus weaddress it no further.\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003e4. The cases tried before the three-judge court were not the onlyactions relating to the legislature's redistricting plans. For example,different plaintiffs tried to challenge the congressional redistrictingplan in both state and federal court.\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003eOn January 24, 2002, Representative Corrine Brown, Representative AlceeHastings, Representative Carrie Meek — all members of the U.S.House of Representatives — and Sallie Stephens filed an actionagainst the State of Florida, Governor Bush, Attorney General RobertButterworth, and Secretary Katherine Harris in the 17th Judicial Circuitof Broward County challenging the congressional redistricting plan underfederal law. See Complaint [DE. 1 in Brown v. State of Florida, No.02-60267-Civ-Jordan]. On March 27, 2002, after the action was removed tofederal court, Speaker Tom Feeney and President John McKay were grantedleave to intervene. See Order [D.E. 35 in Brown v. State of Florida, No.02-60267-Civ-Jordan]. The plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed their federalclaims on April 15, 2002. See Notice of Voluntary Dismissal [D.E. 61 inBrown v. State of Florida, No. 02-60267-Civ-Jordan].\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003eSubsequently, these plaintiffs filed a new action in the 17th JudicialCircuit of Broward County challenging the congressional redistrictingplan under state law. See Complaint [D.E. 1 in Brown v. State of Florida,No. 02-60459-Civ-Jordan]. This action was removed by Speaker Feeney tofederal court. Upon motions filed by the plaintiffs and Attorney GeneralButterworth, however, the matter was remanded to state court on May 2,2002 [D.E. 40 in Brown v. State of Florida, No. 02-60459-Civ-Jordan].\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003eFollowing the remand, Secretary Harris again removed the action tofederal court under 28 U.S.C. § 1443 (2). See Notice of Removal[D.E. 1 in Brown v. State of Florida, No. 02-60689-Civ Jordan]. Theplaintiffs and Attorney General Butterworth moved to remand, and theirmotion was granted on June 4, 2002. See Brown v. State of Florida,208 F. Supp.2d 1344 (S.D. Fla. 2002). On June 17, 2002, the state courtdismissed the action for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction. See Orderof Dismissal in Brown v. State of Florida, No. 02-6106 (09). [D.E. 282 inMartinez v. Bush, No. 02-20244-Civ-Jordan].\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003e5. On July 2, 2002, we entered an order concluding that the plaintiffsand intervenors had not met their respective burdens with regard to anyof their claims concerning the congressional districts and the statesenate districts. We explained that a detailed opinion containingfindings of fact and conclusions of law would be issued as soon aspossible. This is that opinion.\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003e6. We use \"black candidate of choice\" to mean the candidate who wouldbe elected if the only persons eligible to vote in the election at issuewere black. The term says nothing about the race of the candidate.\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003e7. Count I also alleged a violation of section 2 of the Voting RightsAct of 1964, 42 U.S.C. § 1973. We previously granted the defendants'motion for judgment on the pleadings under Federal Rule of CivilProcedure 12(b)(6) on the section 2 claim in count I.\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003e8. As previously noted, the cases before us here were not the onlyactions filed concerning redistricting in Florida. See supra note4.\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003e9. Most, if not all, of the critical submissions and orders in theD.C. action have been filed in the Martinez action at bar (e.g., D.E.186, 246, 269, 272, 289, 307).\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003e10. This was in essence the same claim found in count XV of theMartinez second amended complaint.\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003e11. In view of the three-judge court's inquiry, Speaker Feeneysupplemented the record, by filing the pre-clearance letters from theDepartment of Justice establishing that the open primary amendment to theFlorida Constitution was pre-cleared by letter dated February 26, 1999,and that the suspension of the run-offs was pre-cleared on August 17,2001. See Notice of Filing [D.E. 280].\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003e12. We stated in that order that we would provide a more detailedrationale when we issued our final findings of fact and conclusions oflaw. Having reviewed that order in light of the record, however, webelieve that no additional explanation is necessary.\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003e13. See infra section II.B.6.\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003e14. See, e.g., Chapman v. Meier, 420 U.S. 1, 27, 95 S.Ct. 751, 766, 42L.Ed.2d 766 (1975).\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003e15. We note that neither the United States Constitution nor Floridalaw requires a specific process for public participation prior to thelegislative enactment of redistricting plans. Any state-institutedprocess for redistricting is purely voluntary, as a state is not requiredto hold public hearings at all, let alone at a particular place or duringcertain hours. of course, if a state creates such a process, it cannot beinstituted or applied in a racially discriminatory way. As explained inthe text, there was no such illegal conduct here.\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003e16. As previously noted, similar claims of vote dilution againstcertain Hispanic groups were raised by the plaintiffs but have since beendropped. See supra note 3.\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003e17. One of plaintiffs' experts accurately \"retrodicted\" — thatis, predicted after the fact based on hindsight — the results of113 of the 115 congressional general elections in Florida between 1992and 2000, inclusive. The expert's \"retrodiction\" of the relativeperformance of the Democratic and Republican candidates in any givencongressional election was the average vote cast for the Democratic andRepublican candidates, respectively, in the particular congressionaldistrict, in the 23 contested statewide (non-congressional) electionsduring the same 1992-2000 time period, with nine percentage points addedfor incumbency, also calculated based on hindsight. If we knew therelative votes that would be cast for Democrats and Republicans instatewide elections between 2002 and 2010 and the proper incumbencyadvantage that would be calculated for that period after the fact, thesame methodology could be used to predict outcomes in congressionalelections in the coming decade. But those figures of course cannot beknown in advance. The expert did not compare data from the 1980s tocongressional election outcomes for the 1990s, but it is likely that thepredictive value of the 1980s data would have proven very poor; Democratshandily won most statewide elections in the 1980s but lost mostcongressional elections in the 1990s.\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003e18. In 1995, the Northern District of Florida held that CD 3constituted an unconstitutional racial gerrymander in violation of Shawv. Reno, 509 U.S. 630, 113 S.Ct. 2816, 125 L.Ed.2d 511 (1993). SeeJohnson v. Mortham, 926 F. Supp. 1460 (N.D. Fla. 1996). The legislatureredrew CD 3 to make it more compact and regular in shape. The courtupheld the redrawn CD 3. See Johnson v. Mortham, 1996 WL 297280 (N.D.Fla. May 31, 1996). The change took effect for the 1996 election. Thechange did not affect the other minority districts.\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003e19. Four of the five were expected to stand for reelection in 2002.After conclusion of the trial in the case at bar, Ms. Meek publiclyannounced her retirement, and her son, Kendrick Meek, who at the time wasa member of the Florida Senate, announced his candidacy for herseat.\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003e20. Paragraphs 136, 137, 138, and 143 constitute our ultimate findingson the critical disputed issues of fact. Paragraphs 139 through 142 and144 set forth ultimate findings that are supported by this record, havenot been challenged in this action by any party, and are accepted by uson that basis.\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003e21. Information regarding the format of census self-reporting is basedon census forms that are publicly available on the Census Bureauwebsite. See United States Census Bureau,http://www.census.gov/dmd/www/2000quest.html (last modified March 27,2002). We take judicial notice of this information, which is \"capable ofaccurate and ready determination by resort to sources whose accuracycannot reasonably be questioned.\" Fed.R. Ev. 201(b)(2). By motion toalter or amend, any party may request an opportunity to be heard as tothe propriety of taking judicial notice or the tenor of the matternoticed. See Fed.R. Ev. 201(e).\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003e22. Hispanic respondents also were required to list their country oforigin. As previously noted, unless otherwise indicated, \"black\" is usedin this memorandum opinion to include all persons who, for purposes ofthe census, self identify as black (regardless of whether they also selfidentify as members of another race and regardless of whether they alsoself identify as Hispanic).\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003e23. If as is likely, some persons were counted as black under the 2000methodology who were not counted as black under the 1990 methodology,then the likely non-black vote for black candidates of choice calculatedbased on 1990 data will be overstated when applied to 2000 data. One thuswould expect that, other things being equal, the percentage of non-blacksvoting for black candidates of choice would be slightly lower than onewould project using data based on the 1990 methodology. It is likely thatthe discrepancy would be very small, too small to affect our conclusionsregarding any district. No party has asserted that this difference incensus methodology makes a difference in the overall analysis, nor hasany party proposed a method for adjusting the projections to account forthe change in census methodology.\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003e24. According to the 2000 census, there were 124, 663 underage blacksin CD 23 out of 179,980 total underage residents. See Maurer Exh. 1 at79. Thus 69.3% of the underage residents were black. As they come ofage, the percentage black voting age population in the district willincrease, unless blacks leave the district faster than non-blacks. Noevidence suggests there will be such a migration pattern, and, at leastfor some areas with high percentages of black residents in some cities,the experience has been exactly the opposite.\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003e25. Of course, these percentages do not guarantee that the democraticcandidate — or the minority candidate of choice — will win agiven election. As discussed in part III.D, infra, minority politicalparties are not always cohesive and majority parties do not always vote asa bloc to defeat minority parties. Neither the Equal Protection Clausenor the Voting Rights Act require such a guarantee.\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003e26. CD 23 was not affected by the 1996 amendments to the 1992 plan.\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003e27. The data set forth in paragraphs 148 through 154 primarily addresstotal population and voting age population, not registered or actualvoters. The percentage of black registered voters in both old and new CD23 was in each instance slightly lower than the percentage of voting agepopulation, but the percentage of blacks who actually voted was slightlyhigher. Thus, for example, in 1998 (the last non-presidential electionyear), non-Hispanic blacks constituted 59% of the registered Democrats inwhat has become new CD 23, but 64% of the actual voters in the Democraticprimary, according to estimates based on ecological regression. See Pl.Exh. 81-C at 4, Table 1.\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003e28. Fla. Const. Article VI, Section 5(b) now provides: \"If allcandidates for an office have the same party affiliation and the winnerwill have no opposition in the general election, all qualified electors,regardless of party affiliation, may vote in the primary elections forthat office.\"\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003e29. See Fla. Dep't of State, Div. of Elecs., Op. 00-06 (2000). UnderFlorida law, write-in candidates must qualify in advance. Fla. Stat.§ 99.061(3) (2001). There is no fee for doing so. § 99.092(1),Fla. Stat. (2001). If no write-in candidate qualifies for an election,the ballot provides no block for writing in a candidate. See Fla. Stat.§ 99.061(3) (2001). If a write-in candidate does qualify, the ballotallows a voter to write in a name, but the name is not listed on theballot. Id. If an election is uncontested — that is, if there isonly one candidate whose name would appear on the ballot and no write-incandidates have qualified — the race does not even appear on theballot; the single candidate is deemed to have prevailed. See Fla. Stat.§ 101.151(7) (2001).\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003e30. In at least some circumstances, state laws opening politicalprimaries to voters who are not members of the party violate the FirstAmendment. See California Democratic Party v. Jones, 530 U.S. 567, 120S.Ct. 2402, 147 L.Ed.2d 502 (2000) (invalidating California's \"blanketprimary\" provision). There are substantial differences between the Floridaand California systems. Whether those differences would save Florida'ssystem from constitutional challenge is an issue not now before us.\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003e31. See 2001 Laws of Florida ch. 2001-40 § 46.\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003e32. This conclusion does not rely on the assumption that someoneassociated with a black candidate of choice or even with the Democraticparty would recruit a write-in candidate. It relies instead on theassumption that one person out of the hundreds of thousands who mighthave an incentive to do so would notice that the ability of CD 23 toperform for a black candidate of choice was in jeopardy and would chooseto invest the 15 minutes (and no money) necessary to close the primary bysigning up as a write-in candidate. Some would call this unseemly. Butunseemly or not, the willingness of someone to qualify as a write-incandidate and thus close the primary seems virtually certain in anyelection exhibiting the kind of racial polarization and impact on a blackcandidate of choice that plaintiffs have posited. In fact, the number ofwrite-in candidates for Florida congressional seats increased sharplyafter adoption of the open primary provision, from three in 1998 to 30 in2000.\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003e33. See supra paragraph 160.\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003e34. The 1998 Democratic primary in Miami-Dade County had no racesbetween blacks and whites. The top of the ticket was an uncompetitiveattorney general election. An election generating greater turnout ofcourse ordinarily would generate greater turnout of both blacks andnon-blacks, so that the relative turnout of blacks and non-blacks mightbe the same. But it also might not, especially when compared to thesituation of interest here: an election in which the ability of CD 23 toperform for a black candidate of choice is in jeopardy.\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003e35. Plaintiffs' analysis accepts racial polarization figures computedby defense experts based on data from a set of low-visibility elections.A significant portion of the data are from non-partisan judicialelections, even though the process of electing judges in Florida is\"fundamentally different from the methods used to choose other electedstate officials.\" Nipper v. Smith, 39 F.3d 1494, 1500 (11th Cir. 1994).Using these data, the defense experts project — and plaintiffs'analysis accepts — that 73% of black voters will vote for the blackcandidate of choice, and 32% of non-black voters will vote for the blackcandidate of choice. Using such data to project congressional outcomes,especially in high-visibility, racially divisive elections, ishazardous. In Democratic primaries in CDs 3 and 23 involving both blackand white candidates in 1992, the percentage of black voters who votedfor black candidates was substantially higher, and the percentage ofnon-black voters who voted for black candidates was substantially lower.The net effect of these differences was better performance for blackcandidates than one would have projected based on the polarization datadeveloped by the defense experts. The defense polarization data deal withall voters, not just Democrats, but they are nonetheless inconsistentwith the voting behavior exhibited in the 1992 Democratic primaries inCDs 3 and 23.\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003e36.

That a district will perform for a particular black candidate ofchoice of course does not immunize the district from a dilution claim.But neither is that performance irrelevant. Dilution claims involvepractical judgments about the real world. Our finding is that CD 23 wouldperform for a black candidate of choice in an election to fill an openseat, but our level of confidence in our ruling is increased by thelikelihood that for some (and possibly all) of the elections at issue,there will be an incumbent black candidate of choice for whom thedistrict's likely performance has not been questioned.\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003e38.

We take judicial notice, see supra note 36, that Ms. Brown, theincumbent, has drawn no primary opposition at all since 1994.

Five counties in Florida are covered jurisdictions under section 5of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, as amended in 1982. Hillsborough Countyis one of the five.

The black voting age population of HD 109, at 60.4%, is only 4.5percentage points higher than the 55.9% black voting age population of HD104.

Inmaking this assumption, the Court noted that the Gingles factors \"cannotbe applied mechanically and without regard to the nature of the claim.\"Id. Because the parties agree that racial minorities, and districtslikely to perform for minority candidates, fall within the protections ofthe Voting Rights Act, and because we trace the development of theseGingles factors — as well as the totality of the circumstances test— in some detail as part of our discussion of politicalgerrymandering and vote dilution based on political party, we leave amore detailed discussion for that section.

Although the plaintiffs' and intervenors' equal protection claimis one of political gerrymandering, not vote dilution, the distinction isinsignificant. The Fifth Circuit has explained:\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003eWe see no distinction that would call for different constitutional requisites in a racial gerrymander case than in a voting dilution case . . . [because] [t]he right allegedly infringed is the same in both contexts: the right to effective participation in the electoral process. An unconstitutional gerrymander violates this right by compartmentalizing or fencing out a group or by slicing up a compact minority. An invidious at-large scheme [typical of voting dilution cases] merely achieves the same end, denial of effective participation, by submerging an interest group in a constituency large enough and polarized enough to place that group in the minority consistently.\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003eNevett v.

Anti-single shot voting provisions require that each elector castvotes for as many candidates as there are positions. See, e.g., Nevett,571 F.2d at 217 n. 10. The rule applies \"only in the context of anelectoral scheme that selects winners by ranking all candidates in theorder of the number of votes they receive,\" also known as the \"singleballot-plurality voting system.\" Id. \"An anti-single shot ruleinvalidates all ballots that do not show votes for as many candidates asthere are positions,\" which can disadvantage minority voters by\"forc[ing] them to vote for non-minority candidates, thus depreciatingthe relative position of minority candidates.\" Id.\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003e65. The Fifth Circuit later divided this list of factors into twocategories: \"primary\" and \"enhancing.\" Nevett v. Sides, 571 F.2d 209, 217(5th Cir. 1978). Those factors considered \"primary\" include the group'saccessibility to the political process, the responsiveness ofrepresentatives to the needs of the minority group, the state policybehind the districting scheme, and the effect of past discrimination uponthe group's participation in the electoral system. Id. The \"enhancing\"factors include \"the size of the district; the portion of the votenecessary for election (majority or plurality); where the positions arenot contested for individually, the number of candidates for which anelector must vote; and whether candidates must reside in subdistricts.\"Id.

The ninth andfinal Justice, Justice Stevens, altogether rejected the intentionaldiscrimination standard enunciated by the Stewart plurality, id. at90-91, 100 S.Ct. at 1512 (Stevens, J., concurring), but concurred in itsresult because the proof offered in the court below failed to satisfy thelegal standard he believed was applicable, id. at 92-94, 100 S.Ct. at 1513-14.\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003e71.

The official results from the Florida Department of State,Division of Elections, see supra note 36, demonstrate the following:\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003e(1) CD 1 (as drawn in the congressional map effective in 1996): in1996, 46.5% of the registered voters were Democrat, and 43.6% wereRepublican. In the congressional general election that year, however,Republican candidate Joe Scarborough won 72.5% of the vote; whereas, theDemocratic candidate, Kevin Beck, garnered only 27.4%. By 1998,Republicans had gained a slight plurality of registered voters(Republican: 44.2%; Democrat: 43.9%), but in the general election forCongress, the Republican candidate won by an overwhelming majority— 99.5%. Indeed, there was not even a Democratic candidate. Analmost identical scenario occurred in the 2000 general election.\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003e(2) CD 6 (as drawn in the congressional map effective in 1996): in1996, 45.1% of voters registered Democrat; 43.9% registered Republican.The Republican candidate for Congress that year, however, won 67.2% ofthe vote in the general election held in November; whereas, theDemocratic representative won only 32.8%. Although registered Democratshad a slight plurality in 1998 (by 0.1%), the Republican candidate forCongress that year ran unopposed. By the year 2000, Republican registeredvoters had edged out Democrats by 3.5% (Republican: 44%; Democrat:41.5%), but in the congressional election that year, the Democratic Partyagain did not even field a candidate. The Republican candidate won 99.9%of the vote.\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003e(3) CD 10 (as drawn in the congressional map effective in 1996): in theyears 1996 and 1998, Republican registered voters outnumbered Democratsby a small margin (1996: by 1.4%; 1998: by 0.1%); yet, in both years, theRepublican candidate for Congress enjoyed a safe win, winning 66.6% ofthe vote in 1996 and 100% in 1998. By the year 2000, Democrats had gaineda lead over Republicans in registered voters; 40.3% were registeredDemocrat and 40.0% were registered Republican. That same year, however,the Republican candidate for congress won the general election with 75.7%of the vote. The Democrats once again did not even field a candidate.\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003e(4) CD 12 (as drawn in the congressional map effective in 1996): in1996, a majority of the registered voters were Democrat (51.5%); only38.6% were Republican.

In 1998, registered Democrats stilloutnumbered Republicans (49.3% to 38.5%), but, because the DemocraticParty did not field a candidate, the Republican candidate ran unopposed.In 2000, 46.8% of the registered voters were Democrat, and 38.3% wereRepublican. The Republican candidate for Congress won that year's generalelection, however, with 57.0% of the vote; the Democratic candidategarnered only 43.0%.\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003e(5) CD 22 (as drawn in the congressional map effective in 1996): in1996, 44.1% of registered voters were Democrat, and 41.1% wereRepublican.

By 2000, the margin between Republican andDemocratic registered voters had widened — 42.2% were Democrats and37.9% were Republican.

Of course, registered Democrats often vote for Republicans as aresult of non-political factors — like incumbency, a factor whichevery expert testified holds heavy sway over voters. This truth,however, further proves our point: registered Democrats do not alwaysvote Democratic.\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003e87. Indeed, in closing arguments, counsel for Congressman PeterDeutsch, plaintiff-intervenor, admitted as much.\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003e88. The actual contests were (1) in 2000: U.S. President, U.S.Senator, State Treasurer, and State Commissioner of Education; (2) in1998: U.S. Senator, State Governor, Secretary of State, State AttorneyGeneral, State Comptroller, State Treasurer, State Commissioner ofEducation, and State Commissioner of Agriculture; (3) in 1996: U.S.President; (4) in 1994: U.S. Senator, State Governor, Secretary ofState, State Attorney General, State Comptroller, State Treasurer, StateCommissioner of Education, and State Commissioner of Agriculture; (5) in1992: U.S. President and U.S. Senator.\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003e89. One might argue that the plaintiffs and intervenors submitted thevoting index as proof that registered Democrats are politicallycohesive. The voting index, however, does not identify voters byregistration; it only looks at actual performance. Without such acorrelation, the index is worthless in demonstrating how registeredDemocrats vote. In newly-enacted CD 4, for example, 47.7% of theregistered voters are Democrat, and 38.7% are Republican. The averagevote share of Democrats, however, is only 39.8%; whereas, the Republicanaverage vote share is 60.2%.\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003e90. In CD 22, the average Democratic vote share is 56.3%, and theRepublican share is 43.7%.

The official results of the elections from the Florida Departmentof State Division of Elections, see supra note 36, reveal the following:\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003e(1) CD 10 (as drawn in the congressional map effective in 1996): in1992, Bill Young, the Republican candidate, won the general election with56.6%; the Democratic candidate received only 43.4%. Republican Young wonevery subsequent election, running unopposed in 1994, winning in 1996 bya margin of 33.2%, again running unopposed in 1998, and winning in 2000with 75.7% of the vote.\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003e(2) CD 22 (as drawn in the congressional map effective in 1996): in1992, Republican E.

In CD 1, for example, the average Republican vote share is 62.9%,but in 1992, a Democrat won 52% of the vote in the congressionalelection. In CD 15, however, the average Republican vote share is 56.7%,but in 1992, a Democrat won the congressional election with 51% of thevote.\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003e93. The Democrats are also geographically compact in congressionaldistricts 3, 17, and 23, the majority-minority districts judiciallycreated to satisfy the requirements of section 2 of the Voting RightsAct. See DeGrandy v. Wetherell, 794 F. Supp. 1076, 1087-88, 1090 (N.D.Fla. 1992). The plaintiffs and intervenors do not allege, obviously, thatthese districts were politically gerrymandered in violation of the EqualProtection Clause.\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003e94. The Deutsch intervenors discussed an \"alternative plan,\" one thathad been proposed in the Florida Senate by Senator Campbell (533C0009).That plan yielded twelve seats with Democratic vote index majorities andthirteen seats with Republican vote index majorities. However, this plan— and others like it — are insufficient in proving geographiccompactness because they do not demonstrate that the \"Democrats\" in thoseplans are politically cohesive, nor that the \"Republicans\" bloc voteusually to defeat Democratic candidates. In other words, alternativeplans are helpful in establishing geographic compactness only if there isalready proof that the groups highlighted in the alternative plan areidentifiable, i.e., that they are politically cohesive.\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003e95. The main policy behind most legislatively-drawn redistricting willlikely be incumbency protection. Even if the plaintiffs have establishedthat this was the guiding principle in the instant redistricting,however, this would not weigh significantly in favor of finding theresulting plan an unconstitutional gerrymander. Rather, the Supreme Courthas repeatedly recognized incumbency protection as a legitimate stategoal. See, e.g., Hunt v. Cromartie, 526 U.S. 541, 549-51, 119 S.Ct.1545, 1550-51, 143 L.Ed.2d 731 (1999); Karcher v. Daggett, 462 U.S. 725,740, 103 S.Ct. 2653, 2663, 77 L.Ed.2d 133 (1983).\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003e96. Indeed, the evidence proved the opposite: Congressman Deutsch, aDemocrat, testified that he has, over the course of his tenure as arepresentative, consistently represented all of his constituents, withoutregard to political affiliation. This, he explained, is what everyrepresentative seeks to do.\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003ePlaintiff Maurer makes the argument that we discredited in subpartIII.C.2. In particular, he argues that a Republican-controlled Congresswill be unresponsive to his political views, which, in his words,parallel those of a \"bleeding heart liberal.\" He contends that he \"andmillions of others will lose on the following illustrative issues ifthere be [sic] a Republican US House of Representatives: (a) an impeachedDemocratic President; (b) No chance for an Employment NonDiscriminationAct (ENDA); (c) No chance for an attempted ban against religiousdiscrimination by federally-funded religious service providers; (d) Nochance for domestic partner benefits for District of Columbia employees;(e) No chance to join international treaties on control of chemical andbiological weapons. . . .\" Maurer's argument, however, is tantamount toholding that \"it is invidiously discriminatory for a [politicalsubdivision] to elect its delegation by a majority vote based on party orcandidate platforms and so to some extent predetermine legislative voteson particular issues.\" Whitcomb, 403 U.S. at 155, 91 S.Ct. at 1875. That themajority may reject the views of the minority is \"inherent in governmentby elected representatives.\" Id.\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003e97. This is the number of registered voters in 2000, as reported bythe Division of Elections, Florida Department of State. See supra note36.\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003e98. In the Florida House in 1992, there were 74 Democrats and 46Republicans. The flip-flop began slowly: in 1994, there were 71 Democratsand 49 Republicans. By 1996, Republicans had a majority with 61representatives, leaving 59 Democrats. In 1998, the gap was wider with 66Republicans and 54 Democrats. The total in 2000 was 77 Republicans and 43Democrats.\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003eThe Florida Senate had 21 Democrats and 19 Republicans in 1992. In1994, the Republicans edged ahead with 22 senators, leaving 18Democrats. The Republicans gained one more seat in 1996, and by 1998, had25 seats with only 15 left for Democrats. In 2000, the division was thesame: 25 Republicans and only 15 Democrats.\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003e99. Plaintiff-intervenor, Congressman Deutsch, makes three otherarguments. First, he asserts that this case is distinguishable fromBandemer because Bandemer \"presented a claim that Indiana's exercise ofits reserved power to apportion its own legislature violated the EqualProtection Clause\"; whereas, \"[t]his case presents a claim that Florida'sexercise of its delegated power under Article I to [redistrict] violatesthe Equal Protection Clause.\" Deutsch Mem. in Opp'n to Defs.' Mots. forJ. on the Pleadings [D.E. 134 at 3] (emphasis in original) [hereinafterDeutsch Mem.]. For this proposition, Deutsch cites U.S. Term Limits v.Thornton, 514 U.S. 779, 115 S.Ct. 1842, 131 L.Ed.2d 881 (1995), which, heclaims, confirms \"that a more stringent standard must be applied injudging a state's exercise of its delegated powers in adopting acongressional redistricting plan than the standard that would apply in acase such as Bandemer that involved a challenge to a state exercising itsreserved powers in redistricting its own legislature.\" Deutsch Mem. at 4(emphasis in original). We need not address this argument fully because,even under a lower standard of proving discriminatory effects, theplaintiffs' and intervenors' claim would fail. That less exacting standardwould, at a minimum, require more than mere disproportionalrepresentation. See, e.g., Whitcomb, 403 U.S. at 153, 91 S.Ct. at 1874;White, 412 U.S. at 765-66, 93 S.Ct. at 2339. Disproportionalrepresentation is, however, all that the plaintiffs and intervenors haveshown here.\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003eDeutsch's second argument relies on Article I, section 2, of theConstitution, which, Deutsch asserts, \"limit[s] the power of statelegislatures to put in place barriers that would interfere with the powerof the people to choose their representatives.\" Deutsch Mem. at 2.Indeed, the relevant portion of Article I, section 2, states that\"Members [of the House of Representatives] [shall be] chosen . . . by thePeople of the several States.\" U.S. CONST. art. I, § 2. From thislanguage, Deutsch claims that Article I, section 2 itself is violatedbecause the Florida legislature has gerrymandered so pervasively that ithas \"limit[ed] the choice of the people of Florida by creating at leastseventeen districts in which a Republican will be chosen, and not morethan eight districts in which a Democrat will be chosen.\" Deutsch Mem. at2. Deutsch, however, has failed to prove the assumption on which thisArticle I, section 2, claim is made — that the partisan victoriesin each district are absolute. See supra part III.D.2.a. Moreover,Deutsch has pointed us to no case in which political gerrymanderingsatisfied the Equal Protection Clause but violated Article I, section 2.\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003eFinally, Deutsch argues that the predominant use of politicalaffiliation is, in and of itself, a violation of the Equal ProtectionClause. Deutsch attempts to find precedential support, citing Shaw v.Reno, 509 U.S. 630, 113 S.Ct. 2816, 125 L.Ed.2d 511 (1993), in which theSupreme Court held that using race as the predominant redistrictingfactor is impermissible. Deutsch's argument is foreclosed, however, bythe overwhelming precedent acknowledging that race and ethnicity arespecial categories that require heightened scrutiny from the federalcourts. See, e.g., Cromartie, 526 U.S. at 546, 119 S.Ct. at 1548-49; Bushv. Vera, 517 U.S. 952, 964, 116 S.Ct. 1941, 1954, 135 L.Ed.2d 248(1996). Moreover, the Court has upheld redistricting schemes challengedunder Shaw because the Court found that the legislature was motivated notby race but by political affiliation. See, e.g., Cromartie, 526 U.S. at551, 119 S.Ct. at 1551.\u003c/span\u003e\n\n",
