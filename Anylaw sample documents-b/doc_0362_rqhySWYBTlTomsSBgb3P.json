    "body": "REVISED OPINION\n\nPer Curiam.\n\nThe Probate and Guardianship Rules Committee of The Florida Bar and the Probate and Guardianship Rules Committee of the Real Property, Probate and Trust Law Section, acting as a joint committee, have submitted their quadrennial petition for amendments to the Rules of Probate and Guardianship Procedure. According to the petition, amendments were deemed necessary because of changes in statutory procedures and causes of action, changes brought about by court decisions, and suggestions which were submitted by interested members of the Bar and members of the judiciary.\n\nThe committee also points out the pursuant to this Court's direction in The Florida Bar Re Emergency Amendments to Florida Rules of Probate and Guardianship Procedure, 460 So.2d 906 (Fla. 1984), it has endeavored to identify those portions of the Florida Probate Code which contain procedural provisions and to include within the proposed amendments rules incorporating those procedures. Because of its understanding that the legislature proposes a massive revision of the Florida guardianship law, the committee did not undertake the same task except in one instance with respect to the guardianship rules.\n\nThe committee suggests that the two most significant changes in its proposed amendments are found in rule 5.346 on the subject of fiduciary accounting and rule 5.360 concerning elective share and preexisting dower.\n\nAll of the proposed amendments were unanimously approved by the Board of Governors of the Florida Bar and the Executive Council of the Real Property Section of The Florida Bar. Notice of the proposed amendments has been published in The Florida Bar News. No objections have been filed with this Court.\n\nAt oral argument, counsel advised that the recent decision of the United States Supreme Court in Tulsa Professional Collection Services, Inc. v. Pope, 485 U.S. 478, 108 S. Ct. 1340, 99 L. Ed. 2d 565 (1988), appeared to have necessitated additional amendments to the rules as they relate to notice to creditors. Therefore, at this Court's request, the committee subsequently submitted a proposed amendment to rule 5.240 and the addition of rule 5.495 to accommodate the requirements of Pope.\n\nThe proposed amendments which are attached hereto are hereby approved\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e1\u003c/span\u003e{/Cite} and shall become effective on January 1, 1989. The committee notes are included for explanation and guidance only and are not adopted as an official part of the rules.\n\nIt is so ordered.\n\nEHRLICH, C.

P. 1.090(b) be clarified to leave no question that the court may not extend the time for rehearing, appeal, or petition for certiorari regardless of whether a request to enlarge the time therefor was made before the expiration of the time allowed. Because the format of Rule 5.042(b) was substantially the same as the format of Rule 1.090(b), paragraph (b) is amended to conform for the sake of clarity.

Any interested person who desires notice of proceedings in the estate of a decedent or ward may file a separate written request for notice of further proceedings, designating therein his residence and post office address. When such person changes his residence or post office address, a new designation of such change shall be filed in the proceedings. A person filing such request, or address change, shall also deliver a copy thereof to the clerk, who shall forthwith mail it to the attorney for the personal representative or guardian, noting on the original the fact of mailing.\n\n(b) Notice and copies. A party filing a request shall be served thereafter by the moving party with notice of further proceedings and with copies of subsequent pleadings and papers as long as the party is an interested person.\n\nCommittee Notes\n\nRule History\n\n1975 Revision: This rule substantially incorporates the provisions of prior FPR 5.060 except that now a copy of the request shall be mailed by the clerk only to the attorney for the personal representative or guardian.

DISCOVERY\n\n(a) Application. The following Florida Rules of Civil Procedure shall apply in probate and guardianship proceedings:\n\n(1) Rule 1.280, general provisions governing discovery;\n\n(2) Rule 1.290, depositions before action or pending appeal;\n\n(3) Rule 1.300, persons before whom depositions may be taken;\n\n(4) Rule 1.310, depositions upon oral examination;\n\n(5) Rule 1.320, depositions upon written questions;\n\n(6) Rule 1.330, use of depositions in court proceedings:\n\n(7) Rule 1.340, interrogatories to parties;\n\n(8) Rule 1.350, production of documents and things and entry upon land for inspection and other purposes;\n\n(9) Rule 1.351, production of documents and things without deposition;\n\n(10) Rule 1.360, examination of persons;\n\n(11) Rule 1.370, requests for admission;\n\n(12) Rule 1.380, failure to make discovery; sanctions;\n\n(13) Rule 1.390, depositions of expert witnesses; and\n\n(14) Rule 1.400, publication of deposition.\n\n(b) Limitations and costs. In order to conserve the assets of the estate, the court has broad discretion to limit the scope and the place and manner of the discovery and may assess the costs of the discovery to the party making it or to one or more of the beneficiaries of the estate or to the ward in such proportions as the court determines, considering, among other things, the benefit derived therefrom.\n\nCommittee Notes\n\nRule History\n\n1975 Revision: This rule is the same as prior FPR 5.080, broadened to include guardianships and intended to clearly permit the use of discovery practices in nonadversary probate and guardianship matters.\n\n1977 Revision: Editorial change in citation form in committee note.\n\n1984 Revision: Fla.

RIGHT OF APPEAL\n\nAll orders and judgments of the court determining rights of any party in any particular proceeding in the administration of the estate of a decedent or ward shall be deemed final and may, as a matter of right, be appealed to the appropriate district court of appeal, except those appeals which may be taken directly to the Supreme Court as provided by Section 3, Article V of the State Constitution. Appeals provided by this rule, including the right to supersedeas, shall be governed by the Florida Rules of Appellate Procedure.\n\nCommittee Notes\n\nAn order determines rights of a party may be appealed before the administration of the estate is complete (e.g., determination of the validity of a will, or of the rights of a person to participate as an heir in an estate, is a final determination). The rule defines \"final orders and judgments\" of the probate court that ultimately determine rights of a party in the estate. This rule is substantially the same as former F.S. 732.15 (repealed 1974) except that by rearrangement of the statute the work \"finally\" has been defined.\n\nRule History\n\n1975 Revision: Same as prior FPR 5.100 with editorial changes.\n\n1977 Revision: Citation form change in committee note.\n\n1988 Revision: Committee notes expanded. Citation form changes in rule and committee notes.\n\nRULE 5.110. RESIDENT AGENT\n\n(a) Requirement and form. Before letters are issued to a personal representative or a guardian, the personal representative or guardian shall file a designation of his place of residence, post office address, and the name, place of residence, and post office address of a resident in the county where proceedings are pending, as his agent for the service of process or notice. The written acceptance of the person appointed shall be filed at the time of filing the designation. The designation by the personal representative or guardian and acceptance by resident agent shall constitute the consent of the personal representative or guardian filing it that service of process or notice on the designated agent shall be sufficient to bind the personal representative or guardian in any action against him, either in his representative capacity, or personally, if the personal action accrued in the administration of the estate or guardianship. The designation and acceptance may be incorporated in the petition for administration or for appointment of guardian if signed by the prospective personal representative or guardian, or in his oath.\n\n(b) Corporate fiduciaries. Corporate fiduciaries are not required to designate a resident agent.\n\n(c) Attorneys. A member of The Florida Bar residing in Florida, other than the personal representative, may be designated as the agent for service of process or notice, whether or not he is a resident of the county where the proceedings are pending.\n\n(d) Successor. If the resident agent dies, resigns, or is unable to act for any other reason, the personal representative or guardian shall appoint a successor agent within 10 days after he has notice that such event has occurred.\n\nCommittee Notes\n\nRule History\n\n1977 Revision: Change in committee note to conform to statutory renumbering.\n\nSubstantially the same as prior FPR 5.210, except that under prior rule, designation was required to be filed within 10 days after letters issued.\n\n1984 Revision: Captions added to paragraphs: New paragraph (b) added. Requires filing acceptance at the same time as filing designation. Committee notes revised.\n\n1988 Revision: Change in (c) to clarify that the personal representative, if a member of The Florida Bar, may not also serve as resident agent for service of process or notice. Citation form change in committee notes.\n\nStatutory Reference\n\nF.S. 733.401 Issuance of letters\n\nRULE 5.120. ADMINISTRATOR AD LITEM AND GUARDIAN AD LITEM\n\n(a) Appointment. When it is necessary that the estate of a decedent or a ward be represented in any probate or guardianship proceeding and there is no personal representative of the estate or guardian of the ward, or the personal representative or guardian is or may be interested adversely to the estate or ward, or is enforcing his own debt or claim against the estate or ward, or the necessity arises otherwise, the court may appoint an administrator ad litem or a guardian ad litem, as the case may be, without bond or notice for that particular proceeding. At any point in a proceeding, a court may appoint a guardian ad litem to represent the interests of an incompetent person, an unborn or unascertained person, or a person whose identity or address in unknown, if the court determines that representation of the interest otherwise would be inadequate. If not precluded by conflict of interest, a guardian ad litem may be appointed to represent several persons or interests. The administrator ad litem or guardian ad litem shall file his oath to discharge his duties faithfully and upon the filing he shall be qualified to act. No process need be served upon him, but he shall appear and defend as directly by the court.\n\n(b) Petition. The petition for appointment of a guardian ad litem shall state to the best of petitioner's information and belief:\n\n(1) the name and residence address of each minor or incompetent and birth date of each minor who has an interest in the proceedings;\n\n(2) the name and address of any guardian appointed for each minor or incompetent;\n\n(3) the name and residence address of any living natural guardians or living natural guardian having legal custody of each minor or incompetent;\n\n(4) a description of the interest in the proceedings of each minor or incompetent; and\n\n(5) the facts showing the necessity for the appointment of a guardian ad litem.\n\n(c) Notice. Within 10 days after appointment, the petitioner shall deliver or mail conformed copies of the petition for appointment of a guardian ad litem and order to any guardian, or if there is no guardian, to the living natural guardians or the living natural guardian having legal custody of the minor or incompetent.\n\n(d) Report. The guardian ad litem shall deliver or mail conformed copies of any written report or finding of his investigation and his answer filed in the proceedings, petition for compensation and discharge, and the notice of hearing on the petition to any guardian, or in the event that there is no guardian, to the living natural guardians or the living natural guardian having legal custody of the minor or incompetent.\n\n(e) Service of petition and order. Within 10 days after appointment, the petitioner for an administrator ad litem shall deliver or mail conformed copies of the petition for appointment and order to the attorney of record of each beneficiary and to each known beneficiary not represented by an attorney of record.\n\n(f) Enforcement of judgments. When an administrator ad litem or guardian ad litem recovers any judgment or other relief, it shall be enforced as other judgments. Execution shall issue in favor of the administrator ad litem or guardian ad litem for the use of the estate or ward and the money collected shall be paid to the personal representative or guardian, or as otherwise ordered by the court.\n\n(g) Claim of personal representative. The fact that the personal representative is seeking reimbursement for claims against the decedent paid by the personal representative does not require appointment of an administrator ad litem.\n\nCommittee Notes\n\nRule History\n\n1977 Revision: Editorial change in (a) limiting application of rule to probate and guardianship proceedings. In (b) the petition for appointment of a guardian need not be verified. Deletion of (g) as being substantive rather than procedural and changing former (h) to new (g). Change in committee note to conform to statutory renumbering.\n\nThis rule implements F.S. 731.303(5), F.S. 733.308, and F.S. 744.391, and includes some of the provisions of prior FPR 5.230.\n\n1988 Revision: Editorial changes; captions added to paragraphs. Citation form changes in committee notes.\n\nRULE 5.122 CURATORS\n\n(a) Appointment. When it is necessary, the court may appoint a curator to take possession of a decedent's estate until letters of administration are granted. On appointment, the court shall issue letters of curatorship which shall entitle the curator to possession of the decedent's property, which the court may enforce by contempt proceedings.\n\n(b) Notice. If the person entitled to letters is a resident of the county where the proceeding is filed, no curator shall be appointed until formal notice is given to him. If it is likely that the decedent's property will be wasted, destroyed, or removed beyond the jurisdiction of the court and if the appointment of a curator would be delayed by giving notice, the court may appoint a curator without notice.\n\n(c) Powers. On order of the court, the curator may be authorized to perform any duty or function of a personal representative including publication of notice to creditors, or it a will has been admitted, notice of administration.\n\n(d) Bond. Bond shall be required of the curator as the court deems necessary to secure the property. No bond shall be required of banks and trust companies as curators.\n\n(e) Inventory and accounting. The curator shall file an inventory within 20 days. When the personal representative qualifies, the curator shall immediately account and deliver all assets of the estate in his possession to the personal representative within 20 days, and in default, shall be subject to the provisions of these rules relating to removal of personal representatives.\n\nCommittee Notes\n\nThis rule represents a rule implementation of the procedure found in F.S. 733.501. It is not intended to change the effect of the statute from which it was derived but has been reformatted to conform with the structure of these rules. It is not intended to create a new procedure or modify an existing procedure, except that paragraph (c) of this rule is specific regarding two acts which the curator may be authorized to perform with order of court. This specificity of example was not included in the statute, and the committee, by including this specification, did not intend to limit the authorized acts to those two specified in the rule.\n\nRule History\n\n1988 Revision: New Rule.\n\nStatutory Reference\n\nF.S. 733.501 Curators\n\nRULE 5.150 ORDER REQUIRING ACCOUNTING\n\n(a) Accountings required by statute. When any personal representative or guardian fails to file an accounting or return required by statute or rule, the court on its own motion or on the petition of an interested person shall order the personal representative or guardian to file the accounting or return within 15 days from the service on him of the order, or show cause why he should not be compelled to do so.\n\n(b) Accountings not required by statute. On the petition of an interested person, or on its own motion, the court may require the personal representative or guardian to file an accounting or return not otherwise required by statute or rule. The order requiring an accounting or return shall order the personal representative or guardian to file the accounting or return within a specified time from service on him of the order, or show cause why he should not be compelled to do so.\n\n(c) Service. A copy of the order shall be served on the personal representative or guardian and his attorney.\n\nThe court on its motion or on petition of an interested person may require a personal representative or guardian to file an accounting or return not otherwise required by statute.\n\nRule History\n\n1977 Revision: Change in committee notes.\n\n1984 Revision: Extensive editorial changes.

An authenticated copy of a death certificate issued by an official or agency of the place where the death purportedly occurred or by an official or agency of the United States is prima facie proof of the fact, place, date, and time of death and the identity of the decedent.\n\n(2) Other records. A copy of any record or report of a governmental agency, domestic or foreign, that a person is dead, alive, missing, detained, or, from the facts related, presumed dead is prima facie evidence of the status, dates, circumstances, and places disclosed by the record or report.\n\n(3) Extended absence. A person who is absent from the place of his last known domicile for a continuous period of 5 years and whose absence is not satisfactorily explained after diligent search and inquiry is presumed dead. His death is presumed to have occurred at the end of the period unless there is evidence establishing that death occurred earlier.\n\nCommittee Notes\n\nThis rule represents a rule implementation of the procedure found in F.S. 731.103. It is not intended to change the effect of the statute from which it was derived by has been reformatted to conform with the structure of these rules. It is not intended to create a new procedure or modify an existing procedure, except that additional language has been added which was not in the statute, to permit issuance of a death certificate by an official or agency of the United States.

The rule requires an oath attesting to the statutory requirements for execution of wills and the will must be proved before an order can be entered admitting it to probate. Former FPR 5.280, 5.290, and 5.500 are included in this rule. Committee notes revised.\n\n1988 Revision: Editorial and substantive changes.

COMMISSION TO PROVE WILL\n\n(a) Petition. On petition the court may appoint a commissioner to take the oath of any person qualified to prove the will under Florida law. The petition shall set forth the date of the will and the place where it was executed, if known; the names of the witnesses and address of the witness whose oath is to be taken; and the name, title, and address of the proposed commissioner.\n\n(b) Commission. The commission shall be directed to any person who is authorized to administer an oath by the laws of Florida, the United States of America, or the state or country where the witness may be found, and it shall empower the commissioner to take the oath of the witness to prove the will and shall direct the commissioner to certify the oath and file the executed commission, copy of the will, oath of the witness, and certificate of commissioner. An oath of the commissioner is not required.\n\n(c) Mailing or delivery.

The rule has been broadened to allow anyone authorized by Florida Statutes or by the U.S. Code to be a commissioner as well as those authorized by the state or country where the witness resides.\n\nThe rule now provides that the petitioner or his attorney shall forward the commission to the commissioner. The rule also contemplates that a Florida notary may be appointed as commissioner to take the proof of a witness outside the State of Florida. Committee notes revised and expanded.\n\n1988 Revision: Editorial and substantive changes. Change in (a) to provide that the commissioner may take the oath of not only the attesting witness to the will but also the oath of any other person qualified to prove the will; change in (c) to permit copies other than photographic copies to be furnished to the commissioner, and to permit delivery of documents in a manner other than by mailing; change in (d) to require the filing of documents with the court.

After the petition for administration if filed and the will, if any, is admitted to probate:\n\n(1) The court shall appoint the person entitled and qualified to be personal representative.\n\n(2) The court shall determine the amount of any bond required. The clerk may approve the bond in the amount determined by the court and shall not charge a service fee.\n\n(3) Any required oath or designation of, and acceptance by, a resident agent shall be filed.\n\n(b) Issuance of letters. Upon compliance with all of the foregoing, letters shall be issued to the personal representative.\n\n(c) Bond. On petition by any interested person or on the court's own motion, the court may waive the requirement of filing a bond, require a personal representative or curator to give bond, increase or decrease the bond, or require additional surety.\n\nCommittee Notes\n\nThis rule represents a rule implementation of the procedure found in F.S. 733.401 and 733.403(2). It is not intended to change the effect of the statutes from which it was derived but has been reformatted to conform with the structure of these rules.

NOTICE OF ADMINISTRATION\n\n(a) Publication and service. After issuance of letters, the personal representative shall publish a notice of administration and promptly serve a copy of the notice in the manner provided for formal notice in these rules on the surviving spouse and all beneficiaries known to the personal representative who have not been barred by law. Within 2 months after first publication of notice of administration the personal representative shall serve a copy of the notice on all persons having claims or demands against the estate whose name and location or address are known to or reasonably ascertainable by the personal representative. No such notice need by served on a creditor who has filed a claim in the proceedings or whose claim has been included in a personal representative's proof of claim filed in the proceedings, or on a creditor whose claim has been paid.\n\n(b) Contents. The notice shall contain contain the name of the decedent, the file number of the estate, the designation and address of the court, the name and address of the personal representative and his attorney, and date of first publication. The notice shall require all interested persons to file with the court, within the time provided by law:\n\n(1) all claims against the estate; and\n\n(2) any objection by an interested person on whom notice was served that challenges the validity of the will, the qualifications of the personal representative, and the venue or jurisdiction of the court.\n\n(c) Method of publication and proof. Publication shall be made as required by law. Proof of publication shall be filed with the court within 45 days of the first publication.\n\n(d) Objections. Objections to the validity of the will shall follow the form and procedure set forth in these rules pertaining to revocation of probate. Objections to the qualifications of the personal representative shall follow the form and procedure set forth in these rules pertaining to removal of a personal representative. Objections to the venue or jurisdiction of the court shall follow the form and procedure set forth in the Florida Rules of Civil Procedure.\n\n(e) Statement regarding creditors. Within four months after the date of the first publication of notice of administration, the personal representative shall file a verified statement that he has made diligent search to ascertain the names and location or mailing addresses of persons having claims or demands against this estate. Such statement shall also contain the following information as to all such persons who have not filed a timely claim or who have not had their claim included in a personal representative's proof of claim filed in the proceedings:\n\n(1) the name and, if known, the address of such persons;\n\n(2) an indication whether such person has been served with a notice of administration or otherwise received actual notice of the proceedings.\n\nCommittee Notes\n\nIt is the committee's opinion that the failure to timely file the proof of publication of the notice of administration shall not affect time limitations for filing claims or objections.\n\nOn April 19, 1988, the United States Supreme Court decided Tulsa Professional Collection Services, Inc. v. Pope, 485 U.S. 478, 108 S. Ct. 1340, 99 L. Ed. 2d 565. This case will have substantial impact on the method for handling (and barring) creditor's claims. This case stands for the proposition that a creditor may not be barred by the usual publication if that creditor was actually known to or reasonably ascertainable by the personal representative, and the PR failed to give notice to the creditor by mail or other means as certain to ensure actual notice. Less than actual notice in these circumstances would deprive the creditor of his due process rights under the 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. Probably actual notice of the death (as in the case of a hospital where the decedent died as a patient) without notice of the institution of probate proceedings is not sufficient.\n\nAn elementary and fundamental requirement of due process in any proceeding which is to be accorded finality is notice reasonably calculated, under all the circumstances, to apprise interested persons of the pendency of the proceeding and afford them an opportunity to present their claims:\n\nThe statement required by this rule is not intended to be jurisdictional but rather to provide evidence of satisfaction (or lack thereof) of the due process requirements.\n\nRule History\n\n1977 Revision: Former paragraph (c) is deleted as being substantive rather than procedural.\n\n1984 Revision: Editorial changes; new requirement to file proof of publication; new requirements as to form of objections to will and qualifications of personal representative. Committee notes revised.\n\n1988 Revision: The obligation to mail notice of administration to all known or reasonably ascertainable creditors has been added to comply with the dictates of Tulsa Professional Collection Services, Inc. v. Pope, 485 U.S. 478, 108 S. Ct. 1340, 99 L. Ed. 2d 565 (1988).\n\nThis rule does not require sending notice of administration to creditors in estate where the time for filing claims has expired before the effective date of this rule. However, no opinion is offered whether such claims are barred by the provisions of F.S. 733.702.\n\nCommittee notes revised.

Any creditor or interested person other than a creditor may file a caveat with the court.\n\n(b) Contents. The caveat shall contain a statement of the interest of the caveator in the estate, the name and specific mailing address, and residence address of the caveator.\n\n(c) Resident agent of caveator; service. If the caveator is not a resident of Florida, he shall file a designation of the name and specific mailing address and residence address of a resident in the county where the caveat is filed as his agent for service of notice. The written acceptance by the person appointed as resident agent shall be filed with the designation or included in the caveat. The designation and acceptance shall constitute the consent of the caveator that service of notice upon the designated resident agent shall bind the caveator. It the caveator is represented by an attorney admitted to practice in Florida who signs the caveat, it shall not be necessary to designate a resident agent under this rule.\n\n(d) Filing after commencement. If at the time of the filing of any caveat the decedent's will has been admitted to probate or letters of administration have been issued, the clerk shall forthwith notify the caveator in writing of the date of issuance of letters and the names and addresses of the personal representative and his attorney.\n\n(e) Creditor. When letters of administration issue after the filing of a caveat by a creditor, the clerk shall forthwith notify the caveator, in writing, advising him of the date of issuance of letters and the names and addresses of the personal representative and his attorney, unless notice has previously been served on the caveator. A copy of any notice given by the clerk, together with a certificate of the mailing of the original notice, shall be filed in the estate proceedings.\n\n(f) Other interested persons; before commencement. After the filing of a caveat by an interested person other than a creditor, the court shall not admit a will of the decedent to probate or appoint a personal representative without service of formal notice on the caveator or his designated agent.\n\nCommittee Notes\n\nCaveat proceedings permit a decedent's creditor or other interested person to be notified when letters of administration are issued. Thereafter, the caveator must take appropriate action to protect his interests.\n\nThis rule treats the creditor caveator differently from other caveators.\n\nRule History\n\n1977 Revision: Carried forward prior FPR 5.150.\n\n1984 Revision: Changes in (a), (b), and (d) are editorial. Change in (c) eliminates resident agent requirement for Florida residents and for nonresidents represented by a Florida attorney, Service on the attorney binds caveator. Former (e) is now paragraphs (e) and (f) and treats creditor caveator differently from other interested persons. Change in (f) requires formal notice.

REVOCATION OF PROBATE\n\n(a) Petition and contents. A petition for revocation of probate shall state the interest of the petitioner in the estate and the facts constituting the grounds on which revocation is demanded.\n\n(b) Continued administration. Pending the determination of any issue for revocation of probate, the personal representative shall proceed with the administration of the estate as if no revocation proceeding had been commenced, except that no distribution may be made to devisees in contravention of the rights of those who, but for the will, would be entitled to the property disposed of.\n\nCommittee Notes\n\nThis rule represents a rule implementation of the procedure found in F.S. 733.109(2). It is not intended to change the effect of the statute from which it was derived but has been reformatted to conform with the structure of these rules. It is not intended to create a new procedure or modify an existing procedure. The committee believes that sections (1) and (3) of the statute are substantive, and have therefore not been included. Further, this rule revises paragraph (b) of the prior similar rule to track the language in the statute from which it was derived.\n\nRule History\n\n1984 Revision: Extensive changes.

BURDEN OF PROOF IN WILL CONTESTS\n\nIn all proceedings contesting the validity of a will, the burden shall be upon the proponent of the will to establish prima facie its formal execution and attestation. Thereafter, the contestant shall have the burden of establishing the grounds on which the probate of the will is opposed or revocation sought.\n\nCommittee Notes\n\nThis rule represents a rule implementation of the procedure found in F.S. 733.107.

DISQUALIFICATION OF PERSONAL REPRESENTATIVE; NOTIFICATION\n\nAny personal representative who was improperly qualified or who becomes disqualified to act after his appointment shall immediately present a petition to the court for appropriate action and shall do any and all other things necessary or proper to procure an order approving his resignation.\n\nRule History\n\n1975 Revision: This is same as old FPR 5.220 and old F.S. 732.47(3). The rule sets forth the imperative need for timely action and the inherent responsibility of a fiduciary to effect orderly succession. It further implies the inherent jurisdiction of the court to control by judicial overview the succession.\n\n1977 Revision: Citation form change in committee note.\n\n1988 Revision: Committee notes revised.

OATH OF PERSONAL REPRESENTATIVE\n\nBefore the granting of letters of administration, the personal representative shall file an oath that he will faithfully administer the estate of the decedent. If the petition is verified by the prospective personal representative individually, the oath may be incorporated in the petition or in the designation of resident agent.\n\nCommittee Notes\n\nIt is contemplated the oath may be signed concurrently with the petition for administration and will be valid even if it predates the order appointing the personal representative.\n\nRule History\n\n1977 Revision: No change in rule. Change in committee note to conform to statutory renumbering.\n\nThis rule establishes the uniform requirement for an oath of faithful performance of fiduciary duties within the permissiveness of F.S. 733.401(1)(d). Should be taken together with new FPR 5.110, Resident Agent.\n\n1988 Revision: Committee notes expanded.

EXECUTION BY PERSONAL REPRESENTATIVE\n\nNotwithstanding any other provisions of these rules, the personal representative shall sign the:\n\n(1) inventory;\n\n(2) accountings;\n\n(3) petition for sale or confirmation of sale or encumbrance of real or personal property;\n\n(4) petition to continue business of decedent;\n\n(5) petition to compromise or settle claim;\n\n(6) petition to purchase on credit;\n\n(7) petition for distribution and discharge; and\n\n(8) resignation of personal representative.\n\nCommittee Notes\n\nRule History\n\n1975 Revision: Where the jurisdiction of the court is invoked voluntarily pursuant to F.S. 733.603, or otherwise, the rule requires that the personal representative have actual knowledge of the more important steps and acts of administration.\n\n1977 Revision: Citation form change in committee note.\n\n1988 Revision: Editorial changes.

INVENTORY\n\n(a) Contents and filing. The personal representative shall file an inventory of the estate within 60 days after issuance of letters. The inventory shall list the estate with reasonable detail and include for each listed item its estimated fair market value at the date of the decedent's death. Real property appearing to be homestead property shall be listed and so designated.\n\n(b) Extension. On petition the time for filing the inventory may be extended by the court for cause shown without notice, except that the personal representative shall serve copies of the petition and order on the persons described in paragraph (d).\n\n(c) Amendments. A supplementary or amended inventory containing the information required by paragraph (a) as to each affected item shall be filed and served by the personal representative if:\n\n(1) the personal representative learns of property not included in the original inventory; or\n\n(2) the personal representative learns that the estimated value or description indicated in the original inventory for any item is erroneous or misleading; or\n\n(3) the personal representative determines the estimated fair market value of an item whose value was described as unknown in the original inventory.\n\n(d) Service. The personal representative shall serve a copy of the inventory and all supplemental and amended inventories on the Department of Revenue, the surviving spouse, each heir at law in an intestate estate, each residuary beneficiary in a testate estate, and any other interested person who may request it in writing.\n\n(e) Information. On reasonable request in writing the personal representative shall provide an interested person with information about the estate and shall permit an interested person to examine appraisals on which inventory values are based.\n\nCommittee Notes\n\nInventories are still required to be filed. Once filed, however, they are subject to the confidentiality provisions found in F.S. 733.604(1) and (2).\n\nConstitutional homestead real property is not necessarily a probatable asset. Disclosure on the inventory of real property appearing to be constitutional homestead property informs interested persons of the homestead issue.\n\nInterested persons are entitled to reasonable information about estate proceedings on proper request, including a copy of the inventory, an opportunity to examine appraisals, and other information pertinent to their interests in the estate. The personal representative must also serve a copy of the inventory on the Florida Department of Revenue.

FIDUCIARY ACCOUNTING\n\n(a) Contents. An accounting shall include all cash and property transactions since the date of the last accounting or, if none, from the commencement of administration.\n\n(b) Accounting standards. The following standards are suggested but not mandatory:\n\n(1) Accounts should be stated in a manner that is understandable to persons who are not familiar with practices and terminology peculiar to the administration of estates and trusts.\n\n(2) A fiduciary account shall begin with a concise summary of its purpose and content.\n\n(3) A fiduciary account shall contain sufficient information to put interested persons on notice as to all significant transactions affecting administration during the accounting period.\n\n(4) A fiduciary account shall contain two values, the asset acquisition value or carrying value, and estimated current value.\n\n(5) Gains and losses incurred during the accounting period shall be shown separately in the same schedule.\n\n(6) The account shall show significant transactions that do not affect the amount for which the fiduciary is accountable.\n\n(c) Forms. Model form accounts are attached to this rule as Appendix A.\n\nCommittee Notes\n\nThis is a new rule. It substantially adopts the Uniform Fiduciary Accounting Principles and Model formats adopted by the Committee on National Fiduciary Accounting Standards of the American Bar Association: Section of Real Property, Probate and Trust Law, the American College of Probate Counsel, the American Bankers Association: Trust Division, and other organizations. It is not intended that either the standards of (b) of this rule or the format of the model accounts appearing in Appendix A to this note are required by this rule (they may be required by the Court). This rule in its present form simply provides that the foregoing standards and model accounts shall be promulgated as one sufficient form for fiduciary accounting. It is the intention of the committee to recommend that these rule, when next amended to become effective January 1, 1993, will require compliance with the standards and model account formats as they may be revised in the interim after comments from members of the Bar.\n\nAttached as Appendix B to this note is explanation and commentary for each of the foregoing standards, which commentary shall be considered as a Committee Note to this rule.\n\nRule History\n\n1988 Revision: New rule.\n\nStatutory References\n\nF.S. 733.502 Resignation of personal representative.\n\nF.S. 733.508 Accounting upon removal.\n\nRule References\n\nFPR 5.345 Interim accountings.\n\nFPR 5.400 Distribution and discharge.\n\nAPPENDIX A\n\nRefer to Florida Probate (Code F.S. 733.901(1) and to F.R.P \u0026 G 333(a)(2), § 345 and § 400.\n\nAlso are Accountings, Chapter 12 of Basic Practice Under Florida Probate Code, Second Edition 1981.\n\nEntries on Summary are to be taken from totals on Schedules A, B, C and D.\n\nThe Summary and Schedules A, B, C and D are to constitute the full accounting. Every transaction occurring during the accounting period should be reflected on the Schedules.\n\nAll purchases and sales, all adjustments to the inventory or carrying value of any asset, and any other changes in the assets (such as stock splits) should be described on Schedule C.\n\nThe lost entry on the Summary is to reflect the total inventory or adjusted carrying value of all assets on hand at the close of the accounting period.\n\nSchedule C should reflect all purchases and sales of assets and any adjustments to the carrying values of any assets.\n\nEntries reflecting sales should show the inventory or adjusted carrying value, the costs and expenses of the sale, and the net proceeds received. The net gain or loss should be extended in the appropriate column on the right of Schedule C.\n\nEntries reflecting purchases should reflect the purchase price, any expenses of purchase or other adjustments to the purchase price, and the total amount paid Presumably no gain or loss would be shown for purchases.\n\nEntries reflecting adjustments in capital assets should explain the change (such as a stock split) and the net gain or loss should be shown in the appropriate column on the right side of Schedule C.\n\nSchedule D should be a complete list of all assets on hand reflecting inventory values for each item, adjusted in accord with any appropriate entries on Schedule C.\n\nCurrent market values for any assets that are known to be different from the inventory or carrying values as of the close of the accounting period should be shown in the column marked \"Current Value.\" The total inventory or adjusted carrying value (not Current Value) is to be shown as hem V on Summary.\n\nAPPENDIX B\n\nUNIFORM FIDUCIARY ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES\n\nI. ACCOUNTS SHOULD BE STATED IN A MANNER THAT IS UNDERSTANDABLE BY PERSONS WHO ARE NOT FAMILIAR WITH PRACTICES AND TERMINOLOGY PECULIAR TO THE ADMINISTRATION OF ESTATES AND TRUSTS.\n\nCommentary: In order for an account to fulfill its basic function of communication, it is essential that it be stated in a manner that recognizes that the interested parties are not usually familiar with fiduciary accounts. It is neither practical nor desirable to require that accounts be tailored to meet individual disabilities of particular parties but any account should be capable of being understood by a person of average intelligence, literate in English, and familiar with basic financial terms who has read it with care and attention.\n\nProblems arising from terminology or style are usually a reflection of the fact that people who become versed in a particular form of practice tend to forget that terms which are familiar and useful to them may convey nothing to someone else or may even be affirmatively misleading. For example, the terms \"debit\" and \"credit\" are generally incomprehensible to people with no knowledge of bookkeeping and many people who are familiar with them in other contests would assume that in the context of fiduciary accounting, the receipt of an item is a \"credit\" to the fund rather than a \"debit\" to the fiduciary.\n\nWhile the need for concise presentation makes a certain amount of abbreviation both acceptable and necessary, uncommon abbreviation of matters essential to an understanding of the account should be avoided or explained.\n\nNo position is taken for or against the use of direct print-outs from machine accounting systems. The quality of the accounts produced by these systems varies widely in the extent to which they can be understood by persons who are not familiar with them. To endorse or object to a direct print-out because it is produced by machine from previously stored data would miss the essential point by focusing attention upon the manner of preparation rather than the product.\n\nII. A FIDUCIARY ACCOUNT SHALL BEGIN WITH A CONCISE SUMMARY OF ITS PURPOSE AND CONTENT.\n\nCommentary: Very few people can be expected to pay much attention to a document unless they have some understanding of its general purpose and its significance to the. Even with such an understanding, impressions derived from the first page or two will often determine whether the rest is read. The use that is made of these pages is therefore of particular significance.\n\nThe cover page should disclose the nature and function of the account. While a complete explanation of the significance of the account and the effect of its presentation upon the rights of the parties is obviously impractical for inclusion at this point, there should be at least a brief statement identifying the fiduciary and the subject matter, noting the importance of examining the account and giving an address where more information can be obtained.\n\nIt is assumed that the parties would also have enough information from other sources to understand the nature of their relationship to the fund (e.g., residuary legatee, life tenant, remainderman), the function of the account, and the obligation of the fiduciary to supply further relevant information upon request. It is also assumed that notice will be given of any significant procedural considerations such as limitation on the time within which objections must be presented. This would normally be provided by prior or contemporaneous memoranda, correspondence or discussions.\n\nA summary of the account shall also be presented at the outset. This summary, organized as a table of contents, shall indicate the order of the details presented in the account and shall show separate totals for the aggregate of the assets on hand all the beginning of the accounting period; transactions during the period; and the assets remaining on hand at the end of the period. Each entry in the summary shall be supported by a schedule in the account that provides the details on which the summary is based.\n\nIII. A FIDUCIARY ACCOUNT SHALL CONTAIN SUFFICIENT INFORMATION TO PUT THE INTERESTED PARTIES ON NOTICE AS TO ALL SIGNIFICANT TRANSACTIONS AFFECTING ADMINISTRATION DURING THE ACCOUNTING PERIOD.\n\nCommentary: The presentation of the information account shall allow an interested party to follow the progress of the fiduciary's administration of assets during the accounting period.\n\nAn account is not complete if it does not itemize, or make reference to, assets on hand at the beginning of the accounting period.\n\n3.1 The first account for a decedent's estate or a trust may detail the items received by the fiduciary and for which the fiduciary is responsible. It may refer to the total amount of an inventory filed elsewhere or assets described in a schedule attached to a trust agreement.\n\nInstead of retyping the complete list of assets in the opening balance, the preparer may prefer to attach as an exhibit a copy of the inventory, closing balance from the last account, etc., as appropriate, or may refer to them if previously provided to the interested parties who will receive it.\n\nTransactions shall be described in sufficient detail to give interested parties notice of their purpose and effect. It should be recognized that too much detail may be counterproductive to making the account understandable. In accounts covering long periods or dealing with extensive assets, it is usually desirable to consolidate information. For instance, where income from a number of securities is being accounted for over a long period of time, a statement of the total dividends received on each security with appropriate indication of changes in the number of shares held will be more readily understandable and easier to check for completeness than a chronological listing of all dividends received.\n\nAlthough detail should generally be avoided for routine transactions, it will often be necessary to proper understanding of an event that is somewhat out of the ordinary.\n\nIllustrations:\n\n3.2 Extraordinary appraisal costs should be shown separately and explained.\n\n3.3 Interest and penalties in connection with late filing of tax returns should be shown separately and explained.\n\n3.4 An extraordinary allocation between principal and income such as apportionment of proceeds of property acquired on foreclosure should be separately stated and explained.\n\n3.5 Computation of a formula marital deduction gift involving non-probate assets should be explained.\n\nIV. A FIDUCIARY ACCOUNT SHALL CONTAIN TWO VALUES THE ASSET ACQUISITION VALUE OR CARRYING VALUE AND CURRENT VALUE.\n\nCommentary: In order for transactions to be reported on a consistent bases, an appropriate carrying value for assets must be chosen and employed consistently.\n\nThe carrying value of an asset should reflect its value at the time it is acquired by the fiduciary (or a predecessor fiduciary). When such a value is not precisely determinable, the figure used should reflect a thoughtful decision by the fiduciary. For assets owned by a decedent, inventory values or estate tax values -- generally reflective of date of death -- would be appropriate. Assets received in kind by a trustee from a settlor of an inter vivos trust should be carried at their value at the time of receipt. For assets purchased during the administration of the fund, cost would normally be used. Use of Federal income tax basis for carrying value is acceptable when basis is reasonably representative of real values at the time of acquisition. Use of tax basis as a carrying value under other circumstances could be affirmatively misleading to beneficiaries and therefore is not appropriate.\n\nIn the Model Account, carrying value is referred to as \"fiduciary acquisition value,\" The Model Account establishes the initial carrying value of assets as their value at date of death for inventoried assets, date of receipt for subsequent receipts and cost for investments.\n\nCarrying value would not normally be adjusted for depreciation.\n\nExcept for adjustments that occur normally under the accounting system in use, carrying values should generally be continued unchanged through successive accounts and assets should not be arbitrarily \"written up\" or \"written down.\" In some circumstances, however, with proper disclosure and explanation, carrying value may be adjusted.\n\nIllustrations:\n\n4.1 Carrying values based on date of death may be adjusted to reflect changes on audit of estate or inheritance tax returns.\n\n4.2 Where appropriate under applicable local law, a successor fiduciary may adjust the carrying value of assets to reflect values at the state of his administration.\n\n4.3 Assets received in kind in satisfaction of a pecuniary legacy should be carried at the value used for purposes of distribution.\n\nThough essential for accounting purposes, carrying values are commonly misunderstood by laymen as being a representation of actual values. To avoid this, the account should include both current values and carrying values.\n\nThe value of assets at the beginning and ending of each accounting period is necessary information for the evaluation of investment performance. Therefore, the account should show, or make reference to, current values at the start of the period for all assets whose carrying values were established in a prior accounting period.\n\nIllustrations:\n\n4.4 The opening balance of the first account of a testamentary trustee will usually contain assets received in kind from the executor. Unless the carrying value was written up at the time of distribution (e.g., 4.2 or 4.3 supra) these assets will be carried at a value established during the executor's administration. The current value at the beginning of the accounting period should also be shown.\n\n4.5 An executor's first account will normally carry assets at inventory (date of death) values or costs. No separate listing of current values at the beginning of the accounting period is necessary.\n\nCurrent values should also be shown for all assets on hand at the close of the accounting period. The date on which current values are determined shall be stated and shall be the last day of the accounting period, or a date as close thereto as reasonably possible.\n\nCurrent values should be shown in a column parallel to the column of carrying values. Both columns should be totalled.\n\nIn determining current values for assets for which there is no readily ascertainable current value the source of the value stated in the account shall be explained. The fiduciary shall make a good faith effort to determine realistic values but should not be expected to incur expenses for appraisals or similar costs when there is no reason to expect that the resulting information will be of practical consequence to the administration of the estate or the protection of the interests of the parties.\n\nIllustrations:\n\n4.6 When an asset is held under circumstances that make it clear that it will not be sold (e.g., a residence held for use of a beneficiary) the fiduciary's estimate of value would be acceptable in lieu of an appraisal.\n\n4.7 Considerations such as a pending tax audit or offer of the property for sale may indicate the advisability of not publishing the fiduciary's best estimate of value. In such circumstances, a statement that value was fixed by some method such as \"per company books,\" \"formula under buy-sell agreement,\" or \"300% of assessed value\" would be acceptable, but the fiduciary would be expected to provide further information to interested parties upon request.\n\nV. GAINS AND LOSSES INCURRED DURING THE ACCOUNTING PERIOD SHALL BE SHOWN SEPARATELY IN THE SAME SCHEDULE.\n\nCommentary: Each transaction involving the sale or other disposition of securities during the accounting period shall be shown as a separate item in one combined schedule of the account indicating the transaction, date, explanation, and any gain or loss.\n\nAlthough gains and losses from the sale of securities can be shown separately in accounts, the preferred method of presentation is to present this information in a single schedule. Such a presentation provides the most meaningful description of investment performance and will tend to clarify relationships between gains and losses that are deliberately realized at the same time.\n\nVI. THE ACCOUNT SHALL SHOWN SIGNIFICANT TRANSACTIONS THAT DO NOT AFFECT THE AMOUNT FOR WHICH THE FIDUCIARY IS ACCOUNTABLE.\n\nCommentary: Transaction such as the purchase of an investment, receipt of a stock split or change of a corporate name do not alter the total fund for which a fiduciary is accountable but must be shown in order to permit analysis and an understanding of the administration of the fund. These can be best shown in information schedules.\n\nOne schedule should list all investments made during the accounting period. It should include those subsequently sold as well as those still on hand. Frequently the same money will be used for a series of investments. Therefore, the schedule should not be totalled in order to avoid giving an exaggerated idea of the size of the fund.\n\nA second schedule (entitled \"Changes in Investment Holdings\" in the Model Account) should show all transactions affecting a particular security holding, such as purchase of additional shares, partial sales, stock splits, change of corporate name, divestment distributions, etc. This schedule, similar to a ledger account for each holding, will reconcile opening and closing entries for particular holdings, explain changes in carrying value and avoid extensive searches through the account for information scattered among other schedules.\n\nRULE 5.350. CONTINUANCE OF UNINCORPORATED BUSINESS OR VENTURE\n\n(a) Separate accounts and reports. In the conduct of an unincorporated business or venture, the personal representative shall keep separate, full, and accurate accounts of all receipts and expenditures and make reports as the court may require.\n\n(b) Petition. If the personal representative determines it to be in the best interest of the estate to continue an unincorporated business or venture beyond the time authorized by statute or will, the personal representative shall file a verified petition which shall include:\n\n(1) a statement of the nature of that business or venture;\n\n(2) a schedule of specific assets and liabilities;\n\n(3) the reasons for continuation;\n\n(4) the proposed form and times of accounting for that business or venture;\n\n(5) the period for which the continuation is requested; and\n\n(6) any other information pertinent to the petition.\n\n(c) Order. If the continuation is authorized, the order shall state:\n\n(1) the period for which that business or venture is to continue;\n\n(2) the particular powers of the personal representative in the continuation of that business or venture; and\n\n(3) the form and frequency of accounting by that business or venture.\n\n(d) Petition by interested person. Any interested person, at any time, may petition the court for an order regarding the operation of, accounting for, or termination of an unincorporated business or venture, and the court shall enter an order thereon.\n\nCommittee Notes\n\nRule History\n\n1975 Revision: New rule.

PROCEEDINGS FOR REVIEW OF EMPLOYMENT OF AGENTS AND COMPENSATION OF PERSONAL REPRESENTATIVES AND ESTATE EMPLOYEES\n\nAfter notice to all interest persons and upon petition of an interested person bearing all or a part of the impact of the payment of compensation to the personal representative or any person employed by him, the propriety of the employment and the reasonableness of the compensation or payment may be reviewed by the court. The petition shall state the grounds on which it is based. The burden of proving the propriety of the employment and the reasonableness of the compensation shall be upon the personal representative and the person employed by him. Any person who is determined to have received excessive compensation from an estate may be ordered to make appropriate refunds.\n\nCommittee Notes\n\nThis rule represents a rule implementation of the procedure found in F.S. 733.6175. It is not intended to change the effect of the statute from which it was derived but has been reformatted to conform with the structure of these rules. It is not intended to create a new procedure or modify an existing procedure.\n\nRule History\n\n1988 Revision: New rule.\n\nStatutory Reference\n\nF.S. 733.6175 Proceedings for review of employment of agents and compensation of personal representatives and employees of estate.\n\nRULE 5.360. ELECTIVE SHARE AND PRE-EXISTING DOWER\n\n(a) Optional procedure.\n\n(1) Notice of election. Upon the filing of an election to take elective share, at the option of the surviving spouse, a copy of the election to take elective share, together with a notice of election, may be served on interested persons in the manner provided for service of formal notice. The notice of election shall indicate the name and the address of the attorney for the surviving spouse and of the attorney for the personal representative, and shall include a notice that objections to the election must be filed within 20 days from the receipt of the copy of the notice or be thereafter barred.\n\n(2) Objection to election. Any interested person may file an objection to the election which shall state with particularity the grounds on which the objection is based. No objection shall be filed later than 20 days after receipt of the copy of the notice of election, unless the time is extended. The objecting party shall serve a copy of the objection on the attorney for the surviving spouse and on the attorney for the personal representative. If an objection is served, the personal representative shall promptly serve a notice of election and copy of the election and the objection as provided in paragraph (1), on all interested persons who have not previously been served. The proceedings shall thereafter be adversary.\n\n(3) Determination of entitlement. If an objection is filed, the court shall first determine the surviving spouse's entitlement to the elective share.\n\n(b) Procedure to determine elective share.\n\n(1) Petition by personal representative. If the surviving spouse files an election for elective share, the personal representative shall file a petition to determine the amount of the elective share stating the proposed time and manner of distribution in satisfaction of the elective share.\n\n(2) Petition by spouse. If the personal representative does not file the petition to determine the amount of the elective share, the electing spouse may file the petition specifying as particularly as is known the value of the elective share.\n\n(3) Order determining elective share. The order shall state the amount of the elective share and the time and manner of distribution.\n\n(c) Time of payment. No distribution shall be required until six months from the date of death, when no federal estate tax return is required to be filed, or until the tax return is timely filed, when required. The order may provide for partial distributions.\n\n(d) Suspension of payment. On petition of any interested person after notice, the court may suspend distribution of the elective share or any part of it until final settlement of the federal estate tax liability of the estate.\n\n(e) Petition for dower. The widow may also file an extraordinary petition for assignment of dower in the court of each county or counties where lands lie which her husband had conveyed in which she had not relinquished her right of dower prior to October 1, 1973. Formal notice shall be served on persons adversely affected. The proceedings shall be as similar as possible to those formerly existing for the ordinary assignment of dower.\n\nCommittee Notes\n\nThe surviving spouse may optionally serve a notice of election together with a copy of the election. This procedure bifurcates the issue of entitlement from any issue of determination of amount, timing of payment, or funding procedures. It is intended to allow the surviving spouse and other interested parties to make an early determination of whether any issue exists as to entitlement. If the surviving spouse does not follow this elective procedure or serves less than all interested persons, any person not served may object to entitlement at any time before entry of the order determining elective share. As to any person so served, failure timely to object would waive any such objection unless the time was extended for good cause shown. Good cause for extending the time after its expiration might include the inability to discover the basis for such objection through the exercise of reasonable diligence during the time provided.\n\nIf the optional procedure of paragraph (a) is utilized, the procedural provisions in paragraph (b) still apply, although the proceeding is adversary if any objection is filed.\n\nIf the optional procedure is not utilized, the matters of entitlement and determination may, nevertheless, be bifurcated by the court.\n\nIt is intended that the role of the personal representative in this procedure would be as a neutral. Since he is a fiduciary owing duties to all interested persons, it is not appropriate that he should take a position for or against the award of the elective share and expend estate funds in that regard. See Barnett v. Barnett, 340 So.2d 548 (Fla. 1st DCA 1976); In re Estate of Lynagh, 177 So.2d 256 (Fla. 2d DCA 1965). However, the personal representative is not prohibited from advancing a position regarding the timing of payment or the assets to be used to satisfy the elective share or other such issue relating directly to the administration of the estate and is not intended to favor one beneficiary over another or over the surviving spouse. A personal representative as a fiduciary has a duty of full disclosure to all interested persons and the court, for instance regarding knowledge of the existence of a marital agreement or other relevant facts. The committee offers no opinion on whether a personal representative may have a duty to oppose the entitlement to the elective share based on the existence of an apparently valid marital agreement.\n\nThe case of Menz v. Estate of Menz, 381 So.2d 375 (Fla. 1st DCA 1980), provides for attorney's fees to be awarded to surviving a spouse if the personal representative fails to file a petition to determine the amount of the elective share. If the optional procedure in paragraph (a) is utilized, the filing of the petition to determine elective share may be delayed until final determination of entitlement.\n\nParagraphs (c) and (d) of this rule represent a rule implementation of the procedure found in F.S. 732.214. It is not intended to change the effect of the statute from which it was derived but has been reformatted to conform with the structure of these rules. Iis not intended to create a new procedure or modify an existing procedure.\n\nRule History\n\n1984 Revision: Extensive changes. Clarifies information to be included in a petition for elective share filed by a personal representative and specifies information to be included in an order determining elective share. Committee notes revised and expanded.\n\n1988 Revision: Extensive changes. A new procedure has been added providing for optional service of a notice of election together with a copy of the election and a procedure to expose objections to and determine right to entitlement, separate from the pre-existing procedure of determination of amount and setting aside. Paragraphs (c) and (d) represent rule implementation of procedure in statute. Committee notes revised and expanded.

SALES OF REAL PROPERTY WHERE NO POWER CONFERRED\n\n(a) Petition. When authorization or confirmation of the sale of real property is required, application shall be made by verified petition of the personal representative setting forth the reasons for the sale, a description of the real property sold or proposed to be sold, and the price and terms of the sale.\n\n(b) Order. If the sale is authorized or confirmed, the order shall describe the real property and, if the property is authorized to be sold at private sale, shall fix the price and the terms of the sale. An order authorizing a sale may provide for the public or private sale of the real property described therein, in parcels or as a whole. If public sale is ordered, the personal representative shall give such notice as the order requires.\n\nCommittee Notes\n\nPetitions under the rule are governed by F.S. 733.610, under which sales are voidable by interested persons if there was a conflict of interest without full disclosure and consent, unless the will or contract entered into by the decedent authorized the transaction or it was approved by the court after notice to all interested persons, and by F.S. 733.609, involving bad faith actions by the personal representative. Note provisions for attorneys' fees.\n\nRule History\n\n1984 Revision: Extensive changes. Notice of hearing on any petition concerning sale of real property is required by statute unless waived.

A beneficiary may file a petition setting forth the facts that entitle him to compel payment of devises or distributive interests stating that the property will not be required for the payment of debts, family allowance, spouse's elective share, estate and inheritance taxes, claims, charges, and expenses of administration, or for providing funds for contribution or enforcing equalization in case of advancements.\n\n(b) Order. If the court finds that the property will not be required for the purposes set forth in (a), it may enter an order describing the property to be surrendered or delivered and compelling the personal representative, prior to the final settlement of his accounts, to do one or more of the following:\n\n(1) to pay all or any part of a devise in money;\n\n(2) to deliver specific personal property within his custody and control;\n\n(3) to pay all or any part of a distributive interest in the personal estate of a decedent; or\n\n(4) to surrender real property.\n\n(c) Bond.

DETERMINATION OF BENEFICIARIES AND SHARES\n\n(a) Beneficiaries and shares. If a personal representative or other interested person is in doubt or is unable to determine with certainty beneficiaries entitled to an estate or the shares of any beneficiary of an estate, or a beneficiary entitled to any asset or interest in an estate, the personal representative or other interested person may petition the court to determine beneficiaries.\n\n(b) Petition.

It is not intended to change the effect of the statute from which it was derived but has been reformatted to conform with the structure of these rules. It is not intended to create a new procedure or modify an existing procedure, except that it recognizes the right of an interested person other than the personal representative to initiate this procedure. The first sentence of (2) of the statute has not been included in this rule as the committee feels it is sufficiently covered in FPR 5.025. The second sentence of (2) of the statute is felt by the committee to be substantive and has not been included.\n\nRule History\n\n1988 Revision: New rule.\n\nStatutory Reference\n\nF.S. 733.105 Determination of beneficiaries.\n\nRULE 5.386. ESCHEAT\n\n(a) Escheat proceeding. If it appears to the personal representative that an estate may escheat or there is doubt about the existence of any person entitled to the estate, the personal representative shall institute a proceeding to determine beneficiaries within 1 year after letters have been issued to him, and notice shall be served on the Department of Legal Affairs. If the personal representative fails to institute the proceeding within the time fixed, it may be instituted by the Department of Legal Affairs.\n\n(b) Court's report.

No distinction is made in plans of distribution which distribute estate property in kind among multiple residual beneficiaries proportionate to their respective interest and those which include equalizing adjustments in cash or property and which do not make prorated distribution.\n\nRule History\n\n1980 Revision: Change in prior (a)(6) to require that an objection set forth the basis on which it is being made.\n\n1984 Revision: This rule has been substantially revised. Portions of the prior rule are now incorporated in FPR 5.400 and 5.401. The committee has included the procedure for filing and serving of objections to the final accounting, petition for discharge, plan of distribution or compensation in FPR 5.401.\n\n1988 Revision: Subparagraph (b)(1) is deleted to avoid duplication with FPR 5.346.

If the court is satisfied that disposition without administration is appropriate the court may, without hearing, by letter or other writing authorize the payment, transfer, or disposition of the decedent's personal property to those persons entitled to it.\n\nCommittee Notes\n\nF.S. 732.402 requires persons entitled to exempt property, which excludes property specifically or demonstratively devised, to file timely a petition to determine exempt property. Accordingly, disposition of personal property under this rule should not be granted if decedent's personal property includes exempt property without all persons entitled thereto agreeing to such disposition.\n\nRule History\n\n1977 Revision: Permits the clerk to perform limited ministerial acts in the completion of the application.\n\n1984 Revision: Editorial changes.

If a removed personal representative fails to file an accounting of his administration or fails to deliver to the remaining or successor personal representative all property of the estate and all estate records under his control within the time prescribed by this rule or by order of the court, the removed personal representative shall be subject to contempt proceedings.\n\nCommittee Notes\n\nThe revision of paragraph (a) of this rule by the addition of its final phrase represents a rule implementation of the procedure found in F.S. 733.505. It is not intended to change the effect of the statute from which it was derived by has been reformatted to conform with the structure of these rules.

PETITION TO EXTEND TIME FOR FILING CLAIM\n\nIf a creditor of the estate files a petition to extend the time for filing a claim, after the time allowed by law for presenting claims, or a petition to require payment of claim, which claim was filed after the time allowed by law for presenting claims, and the petition alleges that the creditor was known to or reasonably ascertainable by the personal representative, but was not served with a copy of the notice of administration, such petition shall specifically allege facts showing the such creditor was known to or reasonably ascertainable by the personal representative. It shall also include a verified statement alleging either (i) the creditor did not have actual knowledge of those matters relating to creditors' claims required to be set forth in the notice of administration during the period allowed for filing claims against the estate, or (ii) facts sufficient to obtain relief under Florida Rule Civil Procedure 1.540(b).\n\nCommittee Notes\n\nIt is contemplated that substantially more creditor who have missed the filing deadline imposed by F.S. 733.702 will be filing a petition to extend the time for filing claim, under the authority of Tulsa Professional Collection Services, Inc. v. Pope, 485 U.S. 478, 108 S. Ct. 1340, 99 L. Ed. 2d 565 (1988). This is a new procedure which requires specificity in the relevant factual allegations of any petition based upon the concepts discussed in that case. If the creditor had knowledge of the administration proceedings, but too late in the period to accomplish the filing of the claim, such allegation specifically describing those facts meets the requirements of this rule.

The rule requires the guardian of the property of a ward to appear before the court at the time he files his annual accounting or at such time the court shall determine in order that the court may inquire as to any matter relating to the physical and financial well-being of the ward. This appears to be in conflict with F.S. 744.437 which refers to \"every guardian\" but in the same sentence it refers to \"at the time the guardian files his annual return\" and only the guardian of the property is required to file an annual accounting.\n\n1977 Revision: No change in rule. Change in committee note to conform to statutory renumbering.\n\n1980 Revision: Subparagraph (e) amended to avoid conflict with statutory changes in F.S. 744.437 (1979).\n\n1988 Revision: Matter in (b) deleted; covered in F.S. 744.427(2) and 744.434. Paragraph (c) deleted; covered in F.S. 744.427(4). Captions added to paragraphs. Committee notes revised.

After the filing of the accounting, a person interested as creditor, or otherwise, may file objections to any item in writing within 30 days after filing, or within 30 days after service of a copy when such service is required, specifying the grounds of objection. No item previously approved by the court on notice shall be subject to objection.\n\n(b) Hearing. If objections are filed, the guardian or the objecting person, after the expiration of time for filing objections and on reasonable notice to the other, may apply to the court for a hearing. After the hearing, the court shall enter an order sustaining or overruling the objections.\n\n(c) Order. if no objection is filed to any accounting within the time for filing objections, the court shall examine the accounting and enter its order approving it or requiring proof of the items.\n\nCommittee Notes\n\nRule History\n\n1975 Revision: Substantially the same as F.S. 744.427(3), (5), and (6) with editorial changes.\n\n1977 Revision: no change in rule.
