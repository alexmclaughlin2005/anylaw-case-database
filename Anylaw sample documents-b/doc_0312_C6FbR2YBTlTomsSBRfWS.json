His case was consolidated with the other two on November 15, 1984.\n\nTrial began December 13, 1984. On December 17, the People were granted leave to file amended informations in Nos. 27641 and 27774.\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e3\u003c/span\u003e Jury selection commenced January 14, 1985; a jury was sworn to try the case on February 14. Presentation of evidence began February 27.\n\nOn May 20, 1985, prior to resting their case, the People moved to amend the informations to conform to proof. The motion was granted. On June 10, second amended informations were filed in Nos. 27641 and 27774, and a first amended information was filed in No. 28244.\n\nFollowing an extremely contentious trial filled with motions for dismissal, mistrial, sanctions, severance, and the like, the jurors began deliberations on July 22, 1985. On August 2, they returned guilty verdicts against all defendants on all counts.\n\nRick, Tutti, and Colleen were each convicted of one count of violating section 182, forty-five counts of violating section 288, subdivision (b), two counts of violating section 311.4, subdivision (c), three counts of violating section 273a, and two counts of violating section 245.\n\nGrace, Dill, and Gina were each convicted of one count of violating section 182, forty-nine counts of violating section 288, subdivision (b), two counts of violating section 311.4, subdivision (c), three counts of violating section 273a, and two counts of violating section 245.\n\nForsythe was convicted of one count of violating section 182, thirty-four counts of violating section 288, subdivision (b), six counts of violating section 311.4, subdivision (c), and three counts of violating section 273a.\n\nAll defendants subsequently moved for new trials; the motions were denied.\n\nSentencing took place on August 30, September 3, and September 4, 1985. Forsythe was sentenced to 285 years in prison. Rick, Tutti, and Colleen each received 373 years in prison. Grace, Dill, and Gina each received terms of 405 years in prison.\n\nTimely notices of appeal were filed.\n\nStatement of Facts\n\nI. Family Tree\n\nGrace has six children. Four of them were accused in the instant case: Colleen, Dill, Tutti, and Clovette. Clifford and Norma Pitts have two sons who were accused: Clifford Pitts, Jr. (Cliffy), and Rick.\n\nCliffy and Clovette are married. They were not prosecuted because they fled the state. Clovette has three children: Christine H., born August 10, 1973; James O. (Bobo), born in 1977; and Brandy O., who was born in 1978. At the time of trial, Bobo and Brandy were believed to be with Cliffy and Clovette.\n\nRick and Tutti are also married. Prior to his arrest, Rick had custody of his daughters by a previous marriage to Linda Pitts Cardoso: Carol P., born February 3, 1973; and Lisa P., born April 3, 1977. Both girls are alleged to have been victims.\n\nTutti was previously married to John M., Sr. (hereinafter John), who at the time of trial was married to Janice M. John had custody of his and Tutti's three sons: Johnny M., born August 24, 1973; Tommy M., born February 12, 1975, and Brian M., born May 9, 1977. All are alleged victims.\n\nColleen and Forsythe are married. Colleen has two daughters by prior marriages: Windy B., born April 29, 1975; and Amanda B., born April 25, 1979. Both are alleged victims.\n\nGina is an acquaintance of Colleen and Tutti. Although there was some testimony regarding her children, none were alleged as victims.\n\nII. Development of the Case\n\nSometime after Brian's birth, Tutti and John separated. Tutti and the boys moved to Oklahoma and she and John divorced in 1980. John and Janice were married March 28, 1981.\n\nAfter the marriage, Tutti and her sons returned to Bakersfield. Eventually, Tutti got a job at the Knotty Pine Cafe, which was owned by Clifford and Norma Pitts. It was there that Tutti met Rick; they began dating steadily in April 1982. At that time, Rick was living at 316 Sycamore,\n\nOildale,\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e4\u003c/span\u003e with another woman and his daughters, Carol and Lisa. The woman moved out in August 1982, and Tutti moved in at the end of August or beginning of September.\n\nIn March 1982, John instituted proceedings to obtain custody of the boys, Johnny, Tommy and Brian. He was successful, and Tutti turned them over to him on April 5, 1982. Beginning that month, Tutti received visitation on alternate weekends. She was also to receive visitation the entire month of July. During the latter half of 1982 and all of 1983, visitation took place at the green house. Tutti had the boys every other weekend until the end of June 1983.\n\nRick and his father traveled to Oklahoma at the beginning of May 1983. Rick returned to Oildale a couple of weeks later but moved to Boswell, Oklahoma, on July 2, 1983. His parents, daughters, and brother Mike moved with him. Tutti did not go with him at the time.\n\nTutti got the boys for visitation on July 1, 1983. By then she had moved out of the green house and was living with Cliffy, Clovette, Bobo, and Brandy. The first day Tutti had the July extended visitation, she hired a baby-sitter while she ran an errand. As a result of the baby-sitter smoking marijuana, the boys were taken to shelter care. Unable to get them out until July 5, John and Janice took legal action which resulted in Tutti losing her extended July visitation and resuming alternate weekend visitation the last week of July.\n\nRick returned to Bakersfield around the middle of August to help Cliffy move to Boswell. When Rick returned to Oklahoma a few days later with Cliffy, Tutti went with them. Tutti came back to Bakersfield in September but returned with Rick to Oklahoma where they were married on November 26, 1983.\n\nIn January 1984, Donald Silvius was working as a counselor at Brian's school. Brian and a group of children were found playing in an unauthorized area. A child claimed she had been forced to the ground by the children, who were \"humping\" her and trying to \"kiss her booty.\" Silvius talked to the children involved; of them, Brian, then not yet seven, stood out in terms of his sexual sophistication and terminology.\n\nWhen asked about the incident, Brian said he was accused of humping the girl and kissing her booty, but denied doing so. When Silvius asked how\n\nBrian knew about such things, Brian replied, \"Oh, it happened.\" Silvius assumed Brian was talking about a long time ago and said so, but Brian said, \"No, no, just the other day.\" Silvius asked Brian where and with whom, and Brian mentioned Tutti. As a result, Silvius made a report to child protective services. He also told Janice, Brian's stepmother, what Brian had said and encouraged her to tell the police; when she appeared hesitant, he said he would report it if she did not.\n\nDeputy Jesse Sneed contacted Janice on February 8, 1984, after which he interviewed Brian. Brian said he was in the bedroom when Rick entered. Rick approached from the rear, removed Brian's pants and rubbed Brian's \"pee pee,\" then rubbed it with his own pee pee. Rick then put his penis in contact with Brian's bottom. Sneed asked if anything else happened; Brian said no. Asked if Rick had molested him any other times, Brian stated that was the only time. When asked why he had not told anyone, Brian said Rick spanked him with a belt and said that if he told anyone, Rick would spank him again.\n\nSneed also interviewed Tommy who stated that while he was taking a nap in one of the bedrooms in the Pitts residence, Rick reached inside Tommy's shorts and played with Tommy's pee pee. When Sneed asked if Rick had committed any other acts of molestation on him, Tommy said no. Tommy's response as to why he did not report this earlier was basically the same as Brian's.\n\nSneed spoke with Johnny on the same date. Johnny denied ever being molested while staying at Rick's.\n\nSheriff's Sergeant Bobby Fields (Fields) talked to Janice and interviewed the boys on February 15, 1984. During his interview with Brian, Fields told Brian that he had heard that things had been happening to him. Brian said he had a problem. Fields replied that he had heard about the problem and it would be all right. Brian then said his mom sucked his \"pee wee.\" Brian said this happened one time.\n\nWhen asked about Rick, Brian said that Rick did not do anything to him. When asked if Rick had ever taken his pants off or touched Brian or put his pee wee in Brian, Brian said no, never. When Fields asked about Rick later in the conversation, however, Brian said Rick made Brian hump him at the green house in the summer time. Brian said he and his brothers had been playing, and that he was humped in the backyard. Brian said Rick also humped Tommy.\n\nDuring the interview with Tommy, Tommy said that Rick had put his hands inside Tommy's shorts and rubbed his privates. He did not mention\n\nRick doing anything else, or any other adults. Tommy did not indicate that there had been any type of sexual activity between himself and Tutti. Fields also interviewed Johnny; Johnny did not mention being sexually molested by Rick or Tutti. None of the boys mentioned Colleen or her boyfriend being involved.\n\nFields next interviewed the boys on March 7. Brian said that Tutti and Rick had done things to him. He said that a bunch of times during visitations at the green house Tutti put her privates on his privates. He said that Tutti would take his clothes off, but that she would have hers on. She would lie on top of him, with her stomach on his back. When asked if anything else happened, Brian made a motion with his hand indicating possible masturbation of him by Tutti. Brian also said that Rick had sucked his pee wee a bunch of times. Fields did not ask Brian any questions concerning possible molestation of other children by anyone.\n\nTommy said that Rick would make him lie on the bed with his clothes off and Rick would lie on top of him. Rick just lay there without moving. This lasted about 15 minutes. Tommy also said that Rick put his hands on Tommy's \"ding dong\" several times. Tommy described it as Rick putting his hands inside his pants or shorts. Tommy also said Rick had humped him and put his ding dong in Tommy's butt. Tommy said he could not do anything because Rick was bigger and had threatened to stab Tommy with a knife if Tommy told anyone or did not do it. Tommy did not say anything about anyone else at this time.\n\nOn the same day, Johnny told Fields that Tutti humped him in a bedroom. Johnny said Tutti called him into the bedroom while his brothers were outside playing. Johnny also said that he had to hump Tutti and put his privates in her privates. He made a masturbating motion with his hands and said she would do that to him. He said she would lie on her back and spread her legs and he would lie on her stomach and be between her legs. Johnny said this happened during the visitation. He also indicated that she orally copulated him. In addition, Johnny said that Rick stuck his ding dong in Johnny's butt.\n\nThroughout the March interviews, none of the boys mentioned anything like boards, chains, or shots.\n\nIn the middle of May 1984, Tutti was served with legal documents having to do with custody and visitation of the boys. The documents contained allegations that she and Rick had molested the boys. Rick and Tutti returned to California and brought Carol, Lisa, Windy, and Christine with them. Windy had been living with Clovette for awhile.\n\nDuring an interview on May 31, Johnny told Fields the names of various people who were present during a group sexual orgy. Johnny named his Aunt Sissy, whom he identified as Colleen. He also said that her boyfriend was there, and that there were a lot of people present and he could not name them all. He said he had to \"do it\" with Clovette, and he also talked about Cliffy taking pictures. Johnny told Fields he had a lot more to tell but he was too tired to talk anymore that day.\n\nIn an interview on June 1, Tommy described a group sexual orgy and named Colleen as being one of the people present. He also said Clovette was there, as well as her and Colleen's boyfriends. Tommy said the boyfriends took pictures during the orgies. Tommy said he did not have to have sex with his aunt, referring to Colleen.\n\nOn June 4, 1984, Fields arrested Rick, Tutti and Colleen.\n\nOn June 5, Fields interviewed Colleen's daughter, Windy. He questioned her regarding specific molestations involving Tutti's boys. Windy responded that she did not know what they were talking about. Fields also interviewed Clovette's daughter, Christine. She denied any knowledge of any sexual activity.\n\nWindy and Christine were hostile toward Fields, and he subsequently contacted Carol Darling and asked her to interview the girls. At the time of trial, Carol Darling was the Sex Abuse Program Coordinator of the Kern County District Attorney's office. Her husband, Sheriff's Sergeant Brad Darling, supervised the juvenile sex crimes detail.\n\nMs. Darling first met with Christine about a week after Rick and Tutti were arrested. Christine angrily denied that anything had happened.\n\nFields reinterviewed Brian on June 7. Brian said he had to get on top of Tutti, and he mentioned Colleen being involved in sexual touchings. Brian also said that Windy and Amanda were there. Using anatomically correct dolls, Brian indicated that he performed acts of sexual intercourse and sodomy with Colleen.\n\nFields reinterviewed Johnny on June 13 and Tommy on June 14. Both told him that Colleen had touched a child. Johnny said he would have to lie on a board and there would be chains or straps on it which would be placed over his ankles and wrists, and a chain would be placed across his stomach.\n\nJohnny told Fields about being molested at a public swimming pool. The incident involved Doug, Steve, and \"Carla.\" The boys said nothing about Carla being pregnant. Tommy and Johnny said Carla, a friend of Tutti's, had been present at the green house, but they did not say if she had taken part in anything.\n\nRight around this time, Janice gave Fields a vehicle license number that might have been involved in the incident. A registration check indicated the car was registered to Gina\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e5\u003c/span\u003e at 622 Edwin.\n\nSheriff's Sergeant Jack Rutledge (Rutledge) and Carol Darling jointly interviewed Windy on or about June 22. Windy indicated that molestations occurred in Rick's living room at the green house, and said that Tutti, Rick, Linda Pitts Cardoso, Clovette, and Cliffy were there. She said she was molested, and named Johnny, Tommy, Brian, Carol, Lisa, and Amanda as being present, along with other children. She did not mention anyone named Carla or Gina. Windy did not name Grace or Dill as being involved. She said that pictures were taken by Linda Pitts Cardoso, Tutti, and Clovette.\n\nRutledge interviewed Colleen's daughter, Amanda, then not yet five, on June 25. She also did not name Carla or Gina. She did, however, name Colleen and her husband Wayne, Rick, Tutti, Grace, someone named Timothy, Cliffy, and a big mean man. Amanda said there were other adults there as well, but she did not say who they were.\n\nOn June 26, Johnny directed Rutledge to a certain residence. Gina was outside in the yard. Johnny identified her as the Carla who had molested him. Gina and Grace were both arrested the following day and their residences were searched. No pornography or sophisticated video or photographic equipment was found.\n\nGina participated in a live lineup on June 28. Brian was unable to make any identification, but Johnny chose Gina and said she was the woman he knew as Carla, who had molested him. Tommy also chose Gina, but said she looked like someone named Yvonne who had molested him. Johnny and Tommy both said there were two female molesters who looked a lot alike.\n\nAlso on June 28, Rutledge searched Dill's residence, which was where Colleen had been living at the time of her arrest. No pornography, drug\n\nparaphernalia, cameras, or video equipment were found. Dill was arrested on June 29.\n\nOn June 29, Rutledge again interviewed Windy. She still did not name Carla, Gina, or Grace. However, she named Clovette, Colleen, Linda Pitts, Tutti, Cliffy, Dill, Rick, and a mean man as being present. Prior to this interview, she had also named Forsythe.\n\nAlso on June 29, Sergeant Darling traveled to Boswell, Oklahoma, for the purpose of arresting Cliffy and Clovette and taking Brandy and Bobo into protective custody. On June 30, he and Oklahoma state police officers searched Cliffy and Clovette's residence. It appeared that no one had lived there recently, but in the kitchen was a newspaper article from the Bakersfield Californian concerning the instant case. No video equipment, lights on stands, or televisions were found either in Cliffy's or Rick's residences, which were approximately one and one-half miles apart. No videotapes or pornographic photographs were found, although sexual pedophiles generally regard such items as prized possessions and rarely dispose of them.\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e6\u003c/span\u003e\n\nEventually, warrants were sworn out for the arrest of Cliffy and Clovette, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation was contacted. As of the date of trial, Cliffy and Clovette had not been apprehended, nor had Brandy and Bobo been found.\n\nOn July 3, Lisa's foster mother took Lisa and Carol to Ms. Darling's office. Lisa, then seven, said some bad things happened at the green house, that the children did things to each other when they had their clothes off. Lisa said she was not supposed to talk about these things and did not want to, so Ms. Darling did not pursue the subject.\n\nOn July 17, Fields showed a photographic lineup to Johnny, Tommy, and Brian. All three identified Forsythe. A warrant was issued for Forsythe around July 23.\n\nOn July 24, Janice and Johnny were on the third floor of the courthouse for a preliminary hearing. A child molestation trial was in progress, and a blond woman was sitting outside waiting to testify. Johnny pointed her out as having been involved. Fields was called to the courthouse, where he arrested Vicki Raye Pearce. Tommy and Brian both picked her photograph out of a photographic lineup. Fields never showed her photograph to any of the other children and no charges were ever filed against her.\n\nOn August 1, Johnny identified a photograph of Carla Joyce and said she was a friend of his mother's who was not involved. Nevertheless, Carla Joyce was ultimately arrested in the case and given immunity in return for her testimony. The immunity agreement was later rescinded by the district attorney's office and prosecution reinstated.\n\nWhen discussing the molestations with Janice sometime after June 4, Johnny used the names \"Doug\" and \"Steve\" when referring to \"mean guys\" he said were involved. During the summer of 1984, Janice attended a gymnastics meet with Brian and Tommy. There, the boys showed her individuals they identified as Doug and Steve. As a result, Janice called the police and the men, Gary Mazzarelli and Brian Lee Butler, were arrested. They appeared in two different live lineups. Butler's was first, and Johnny was the first child to view it. He identified Butler but simply marked the position on his identification card and did not give Fields the name \"Doug\" or \"Steve.\" Christine viewed the lineup next, but did not identify anyone. Tommy and Brian both identified Butler. Amanda was next; she identified someone else who was apparently merely someone from the jail used in the lineup, and as to whom Fields never conducted any investigation. Windy made no identification.\n\nJohnny was first to view the live lineup which included Mazzarelli; he identified someone else. Windy picked Timothy Paloma, a suspect in another molestation case, as being someone she thought looked familiar. Amanda identified a man who, as far as Fields knew, was merely someone selected at random for the lineup. Fields never investigated any of these men with regard to possible involvement in the instant case. Neither Christine nor Brian identified anyone, despite the fact that Butler and Mazzarelli were arrested three days before the lineup and Brian identified Mazzarelli at the gymnastics meet. Tommy viewed the lineup last; he identified Mazzarelli. Butler and Mazzarelli were released from custody shortly after the lineup following further investigation.\n\nJanice was also present on one occasion, after Rick's and Tutti's arrest, when one of the boys identified a woman in a bank as one of the molesters. The woman did not become a defendant.\n\nForsythe was arrested on October 11, 1984. He waived his rights and told Fields that he had been sort of lying low. He denied having any cameras or video recording equipment.\n\nAccording to Ms. Darling's recollection, she and Christine saw each other 20 to 25 times, but only talked about sexual matters on 4 occasions. A few days before November 30, Christine came into Ms. Darling's office and at the end of their time together, Christine, then 11, said she did not want to lie in court, that she was molested and wanted to tell Ms. Darling about it. They set up another appointment for November 30 and during that interview and another one on December 3, Ms. Darling asked Christine general questions about what happened at the green house. Christine said Rick was not going to control her anymore and that her stomach no longer hurt. Christine indicated she was afraid of defendants, especially Rick and Forsythe.\n\nChristine listed the following adults as being present when the sexual things happened: Rick, Forsythe, Clovette, Cliffy, Colleen, Dill, Tutti, Grace, Carla -- a friend of Colleen's whose last name she did not know, a large white male who acted like Rick, and other adults she was unable to name. She did not name Gina. The children she named were herself, Carol, Lisa, Johnny, Tommy, Brian, Bobo, Brandy, Windy, Amanda, and two unknown girls, aged approximately six and nine years. Christine said she had to touch Johnny, Brian, Tommy, and Bobo. She also said she had to touch Clovette, Colleen, Tutti, Grace, Carla, Carol, and Lisa. Christine told Ms. Darling about being at the green house every other weekend that she was not with her father. She talked for a long time about seeing other children go behind closed doors but not going in herself, then being called in. Once she was called in and became aware of what was going on, she was pretty much involved when the sexual things would happen at the house, which was approximately every other weekend. Christine said the nasty things started a year and a half before the Oklahoma move.\n\nOn December 5, 1984, Dimas Cardoso, Carol and Lisa's stepfather, brought the girls in to get reacquainted with Ms. Darling. Ms. Darling told at least Lisa, and possibly both girls, that Christine had experienced some things and was happy she had told Ms. Darling. When Ms. Darling was alone with Lisa and Dimas, she asked Lisa if she remembered telling Ms. Darling some things before. Lisa, not yet eight, said she remembered; Ms. Darling asked if she wanted to talk about them again. Lisa said it was hard and embarrassing. Ms. Darling talked about the definition of \"nasty things,\" then asked Lisa when the nasty things occurred. Lisa said it was before they went to Oklahoma. Ms. Darling asked if it would be easier to tell the names of the people who were there when the nasty things happened,\n\nand Lisa said it would. Lisa said Tutti and Rick and someone \"I bet you just don't know\" were present. This person was a lady named Yvonne, who had a daughter named Angela. Lisa also said Carol, Johnny, Tommy, and Brian were present. When Ms. Darling asked if Lisa had seen a weapon at her home, Lisa said it was hard to tell about it. Lisa did not identify any weapon.\n\nIII. The Children's Trial Testimony\n\nChristine H., date of birth August 10, 1973, daughter of Clovette.\n\nBefore the move to Boswell, Clovette took Christine to the green house almost every other weekend. Sometimes Johnny, Tommy, and Brian were there.\n\nChristine was able to remember a time when she went to the green house and saw lots of children and adults there. On many occasions, there were adults and children there without clothes on. On the time Christine remembered best in 1983, Rick, Tutti, Colleen, and Forsythe were there. Carla was not there. Although sometimes Dill was also there, neither Dill nor Grace was there on the time Christine remembered best. A big, mean-looking man was there, as were two younger children whose names Christine did not know. The other children present were Brandy, Bobo, Carol, Lisa, Johnny, Tommy, Brian, Windy, and Amanda.\n\nOn this occasion everyone was in a bedroom and Rick ordered the children, in a mean voice, to take their clothes off. Forsythe also gave orders. Rick had a knife, the kind that does not fold. He also had a black gun, which he pointed at Johnny's penis. He said that Johnny better do what he told him, or Rick would \"blow it off.\" Rick also threatened to tie the children to a board which was up against the wall. A rope and pair of handcuffs were on the board. Christine never saw the board or handcuffs used in any way.\n\nAll of the children and adults removed their clothes. The children then did what Rick told them. They touched each other on their private parts. Johnny touched Carol, Windy, Christine, Bobo, and Amanda. Johnny also lay on top of Carol. Bobo lay on top of Lisa and Windy. During this time, the adults were in the room, nude, and Rick was telling the children what to do. Tommy touched Amanda on her private parts. Brian touched Carol and Christine. He touched Christine on her private. Christine had to touch Johnny's and Bobo's penises. Tommy touched her private. She had to get on top of Tommy. In addition, Christine had to touch Amanda, Carol, and\n\nBrandy on their privates. Bobo had to lie on top of Christine. While the children were touching each other, the adults were watching.\n\nOn this time that Christine remembered best, Rick, Colleen, and Tutti touched some of the children. Rick touched Christine on her private with his hand. Johnny touched his mouth to Colleen's breasts. Bobo touched Tutti's breasts with his mouth. Everybody was watching. In addition, Rick put his penis in Johnny's butt. Rick did the same thing to Tommy. Forsythe touched all of the children where they go to the bathroom. Tutti touched Brian on his penis. When Windy needed to go to the bathroom, Rick made her go on the floor.\n\nOn this occasion, Forsythe took pictures of what was going on. Christine did not see any of the pictures or movies later. This episode happened in the daytime, around Christmas of the year Christine was in fourth grade. The next summer she moved to Oklahoma.\n\nChristine was also able to remember another time when she went to the green house and there were a lot of adults and children without their clothes. It was sometime between January and June 1983, after the time she remembered best. On that occasion, Christine put her mouth on Rick's penis. She did the same thing to Forsythe's penis. Bobo touched Grace's breasts; Windy touched Dill's penis with her mouth. Colleen was present and had her clothes off, but Christine could not recall any child touching her or vice versa. Additionally, Christine's privates touched Johnny's privates. Her body also touched Brian's body but not Tommy's, although her body touched Tommy's on at least one of the occasions. On neither of the occasions did Rick's privates touch Christine's body, nor did her body touch Bobo's body. Although Christine was able to identify Gina at trial, she did not think Gina was present. Dill was present without clothes on, but Christine could not recall whether he touched anyone. However, many times on many different days, Christine saw Dill in the green house touching children in their private places.\n\nChristine remembered that she also had to touch Forsythe's penis with her mouth during the time she remembered best. Those were the only times she had to do that. Although Christine described numerous tattoos on Forsythe's body, she did not think he had any below his belt line.\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e7\u003c/span\u003e\n\nOn occasion at the green house, Christine saw Rick use a movie camera. Both times she remembered, all of the adults and children touched each\n\nother's private parts. Rick had a gun and knife on more than one occasion. No one ever gave Christine shots. No one ever put anything up her rear end, and she never saw anyone put a gun up Johnny's rear end.\n\nOn one or more of the occasions Christine remembered, every adult except Grace shared a skinny, tightly rolled, funny-smelling cigarette. Christine also saw a white powder substance in a straight line on a table. Rick put it there. All of the adults, except Grace, sniffed the powder up their noses with a straw. One of the adults called the powder cocaine.\n\nThe sexual things happened many times. Rick was always there. The first time Christine remembered them happening, they happened in Carol and Lisa's room. Christine first testified these things always happened in Carol and Lisa's bedroom. Later she stated they occurred twice in Rick and Tutti's room.\n\nChristine did not tell anyone about these things because she was terrified of Rick. When she was first questioned, she said nothing happened because she was scared. She told Fields that Johnny was making all this crud up and that everything was Johnny's fault, but this was not the truth. Ms. Darling was the first person she told about these things.\n\nTommy M., date of birth February 12, 1975, son of Tutti and John.\n\nTommy remembered a time when he lived with his father and Janice and went to visit Rick and Tutti every other weekend at a green house. A lot of times, nasty things happened there.\n\nTommy could remember the last time nasty things happened at the green house and another time they happened around the time of his track meet.\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e8\u003c/span\u003e He was also able to remember a third time, the time he remembered best other than those two times.\n\nOn the third time, the adults present were Tutti, Rick, Colleen, Forsythe, Dill, Grace, Clovette, Cliffy, Gina, Doug, and Steve. Tommy testified that although he did not know Gina's name, he knew her and she was present, clothes off, on this occasion. Doug had long blond hair and tattoos down his arm. Steve had brown hair and a mustache. Both were skinny. The children present were Windy, Amanda, Bobo, Christine, Brian, Johnny, Carol, Lisa, and Bobo's s sister.\n\nOn this occasion, the nasty things happened in Carol and Lisa's room. All of the adults and children were in the room. There were lights and cameras; sometimes the cameras were operated by Rick and Dill. A camera was in use while the nasty things happened.\n\nDuring this episode, Rick \"peed\" in a bottle and stuck it up Tutti's vagina. He then gave it to Tommy, Johnny, and Brian, and Forsythe told them to drink it. All the adults, who were naked, were taking pictures and laughing. Tommy also had to drink \"pee\" on other occasions at the green house. The act was always filmed. Additionally, Rick played with Tommy's private. Forsythe took pictures. Rick also put his private in Tommy's butt. Although Rick put baby oil and baby powder on his penis first, it hurt. Dill was taking pictures and the other adults were laughing. Sometimes more than one person took pictures at the same time.\n\nTommy also had to put his mouth on Rick's penis because Rick told him to do this. Rick's penis was hard, and he told Tommy to suck it. This happened a bunch of times. On one occasion, Rick told Tommy to swallow something that came from his penis. Colleen also told him to swallow it. This happened on a bunch of days.\n\nOn this third occasion that Tommy could remember, Rick had a little bottle of white powder that he poured on a table that had pennies embedded in the top and was referred to by the children as the penny table. Rick poured the powder in lines that were about three-fourths of an inch wide and fifteen inches long. Rick made Tommy, Johnny, and Brian sniff it. It made Tommy feel dizzy. Forsythe told him to sniff the powder. Christine, Bobo, Amanda, and Windy also had to sniff it.\n\nOn this occasion, Rick stuck his tongue in Tommy's, Johnny's, and Brian's mouths. At this time, Rick had his clothes on. Later, he removed his clothes and the other nasty things happened. During this episode, Rick took some of the white powder from the bottle and put it on his privates. Tommy had to put Rick's private in his mouth and swallow the powder. It made Tommy's mouth feel salty. Tommy also had to get on top of Tutti and stick his privates in hers. The lights were facing him and Rick was using the camera. Tommy and his brothers also had to suck on Tutti's breasts. In addition, Tommy had to put his head between Tutti's legs and lick her private. Tommy never saw anyone put white powder on Tutti's privates.\n\nTommy also had to suck on Colleen's breasts. Forsythe took pictures. Tommy had to get on top of Colleen, put his privates in her vagina, and go up and down. Forsythe told him to do this while Dill took pictures. Tommy\n\nalso had to lick Colleen's vagina. Colleen had letters tattooed above the hair by her vagina.\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e9\u003c/span\u003e\n\nOn this occasion, Tommy did not have to do anything nasty with Grace. However, he had to put his penis in Dill's rear end. Forsythe told him to do this. Rick was taking pictures. During this time, Grace's clothes were off, but she was just watching. Grace has cherries tattooed on her bottom.\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e10\u003c/span\u003e\n\nTommy also had to suck Dill's penis. Dill told him to do that. Forsythe was holding a camera.\n\nDuring this episode, Doug had a gun which he said was a .22. Doug stuck it up Tommy's rear end. The pistol had a raised sight on the barrel, right at the part that went in Tommy. It did not hurt when Doug put the gun inside his bottom. The gun did not actually go inside Tommy's butt, but just touched his cheeks. On this and other occasions, Doug stuck a gun on the butts of Tommy, Brian, Johnny, and Bobo. Doug stuck the gun on the rear ends of all the kids, every time. Doug threatened to kill all the children if they told what had happened. Doug had the gun when he said this. Steve had a knife. They also threatened to shoot or cut the boys' penises off. This all happened on the third occasion. Doug and Steve were both strangers, not relatives.\n\nColleen and Forsythe told Tommy to do nasty things with some of the other children. Tommy had to lie on top of Windy. Forsythe and Dill filmed this. Tommy had to do the same thing to Amanda. Forsythe and Dill were smoking dope. Forsythe made Tommy smoke one of the funny cigarettes. It made Tommy feel dizzy. Tommy also had to get on top of Christine, put his privates on her private, and go up and down. Clovette told him to do that. Forsythe was filming. Tommy also had to put his mouth to Christine's privates. Cliffy told him to do that. Dill was filming. The other adults were watching Tommy. Tommy subsequently said he did not have to put his mouth on any part of Christine's body.\n\nAll of the defendants except Tutti were there watching; they were all naked. Tommy saw everyone's penis. No one had a tattoo there. Tutti was at the store. It was a different time when Tommy had to do things with Tutti.\n\nOn this third time, someone gave Tommy beer to drink. Tommy drank about half of the bottle. It did not make him feel funny. Someone also gave\n\nhim about one-half to three-fourths of an inch of whiskey in a glass. Tommy drank it all. It did not make him feel funny. Tommy also smoked half of a pot cigarette, which likewise did not make him feel funny. In addition, he sniffed a line of white powder off the penny table. The line was about 15 inches long. It made him feel funny. Tommy ingested all of the substances on the same day, before anyone did nasty things to him.\n\nTommy also was given shots with a needle attached to a little gun. The shots, which were in two different spots, hurt and bled a little. They left a small mark and there was swelling. They left black spots between the size of a dime and a quarter. Tommy got sick and threw up after the shots. Forsythe, Rick, and Dill gave him the shots.\n\nOn this occasion, all of the other children also got shots, sniffed white powder, smoked pot, and had beer and whiskey. Everyone cried when they got their shots. The needle was never changed; the children were given the shots right in a row. When Tommy went home, he did not show Janice the black mark or hole from the shot because the marks were gone. Tommy was scared to show anyone. On the other two times (the last time Tommy remembered and the track meet time), Tommy also had whiskey, beer, pot, white powder, and shots. So did Johnny and Brian and all the other kids there.\n\nThe nasty things happened about 20 times when Tommy was at the green house. It was mostly the same adults and same children involved, and mostly the same things happened. Tutti was there on all but one occasion. Grace was there three times that nasty things occurred. Colleen, Forsythe, Rick, Dill, Steve, Doug, Cliffy, and Clovette were there all of the times.\n\nOn the last time Tommy could remember things happening, they happened in Rick's room. The room had a water bed and a dresser in it. A camera and lights were present. Tutti, Grace, Colleen, Forsythe, Rick, Dill, Gina, Cliffy, Clovette, Doug, and Steve were there. The children present were Tommy, Christine, Windy, Amanda, Bobo, Brandy, Carol, Lisa, Johnny, and Brian.\n\nOn this occasion, Tommy had to touch Tutti's, but not Grace's, body. Rick stuck his penis in Brian's rear end. Cliffy was using the camera. Brian put his mouth on Rick's privates. Forsythe took a picture. In addition, Rick put powder on his private and made Tommy suck it. Rick also put powder on his penis, then stuck his penis in Tommy's rear end. Tommy did not see Rick do anything with Christine, Carol, or Lisa. However, Rick put his privates in Bobo's butt and stuck his tongue in Bobo's mouth. Rick also stuck his tongue in Tommy's mouth. Rick put his privates in Windy's\n\nvagina. Additionally, Rick again got a cup and peed in it. He made Tommy, Bobo, Brandy, and Windy drink pee from the cup. Someone filmed the incident.\n\nAlso on this occasion, Tommy had to kiss Tutti's breasts and suck her nipple and get on top of her while she was naked. He had to put his tongue in her vagina. Rick told him to do this. Besides Tommy, Johnny, Brian, Brandy, Bobo, Christine, and Windy all had to put their mouths on Tutti's vagina. Someone was filming this as it went on. In addition, Tutti sucked Tommy's penis. Additionally, Tommy, Johnny, Brian, Bobo, Brandy, Christine, Windy, and Amanda had to suck Colleen's breasts and all but Brandy also had to put their mouths on Colleen's privates. Forsythe put his privates in Tommy's butt and Tommy had to suck Forsythe's privates. Tommy, his brothers, and his cousins had to suck Dill's privates. Dill stuck his privates in their butts.\n\nTommy initially testified that none of the men had tattoos on their penises that he saw but, later, stated he could not remember.\n\nTommy, Johnny, and Brian had to get on top of Christine and go up and down. Forsythe was using the still camera at the time. Tommy, Johnny, and Bobo had to get on top of Windy. Dill was holding a camera over them. Tommy, Johnny, Brian, and Bobo also had to get on top of Carol and go up and down.\n\nOn this occasion, Doug had a gun and Steve had a knife. Doug held the gun to Tommy's neck and told him not to tell. Doug also pointed the gun at Tommy's privates and said not to tell or he would blow off Tommy's \"dick.\" Steve held the knife to Tommy's privates and said he would cut it off if Tommy told.\n\nGrace was there about 12 times that nasty things happened. Each time, she did something to Tommy's body. On these occasions, the other adults were also present. On the time Tommy remembered best that Grace did something, the things happened in Carol and Lisa's room. Tommy had to lie on top of Grace and suck her breasts. He also had to put his mouth on Grace's private. Tommy testified that Grace's privates smelled like the other women's. However, he admitted telling coprosecutor Gindes that he did not like to put his mouth on Grace's privates because she had a real bad smell down there. There were times when the adults made Tommy watch while Grace was on the toilet. Grace did not wipe her rear end. When Tommy put his mouth on her privates, he could smell \"poop.\" Tommy's brothers also had to do this. Tommy's brothers and Bobo had to lie on top\n\nof Grace. His brothers, Bobo, and Amanda had to put their mouths between her legs.\n\nOn an unspecified occasion, Tommy saw Bobo forced to pee in front of the adults. Also, Forsythe told Windy to pee in a cup. This was at the green house.\n\nOn various occasions, a board was used. Tommy was strapped on it about 12 times. People then sucked his privates. Tommy's brothers and cousins were also strapped to the board and had things done to their bodies. Tommy saw the board in Carol and Lisa's room and in the very back room of the green house. Tommy saw Christine on the board a whole bunch of times.\n\nTommy also saw handcuffs on the wall of the green house, in Carol and Lisa's room. Forsythe and Dill were the only ones who used them. If the children got too wild, their hands and feet would be cuffed.\n\nSometimes Forsythe showed movies on the television. They were films of Tommy and the others doing nasty things. A bunch of people were talking on the film. Tommy could not remember if anyone was saying what was happening.\n\nAt a different time, around the time of a track meet at North High, things happened in the green house in the girls' bedroom. The adults present were Tutti, Rick, Colleen, Forsythe, Dill, Grace, Doug, Steve, Cliffy, and Clovette. The children present were Tommy, Windy, Bobo, Christine, Johnny, Brian, Brandy, and Amanda. There were cameras and lights. Everyone was naked. Forsythe, who always brought the white powder, had a jar of it in his pocket. The powder was put on Rick's penis, then Tommy, Johnny, Brian, Bobo, and Tommy's cousins had to put their mouths on Rick's privates. Rick did not sodomize any of the children this time, nor did Tommy have to do anything else with Rick. Tommy did not have to do anything nasty with Forsythe, either. The only other adult Tommy had to do anything with was Dill. Tommy, Johnny, and all his cousins had to suck Dill's privates. In addition, Tommy had to stick his privates in the vaginas of his girl cousins and go up and down. His brothers did this, too. Forsythe filmed it. Tommy also had to put his penis in the rear ends of Johnny, Brian, Windy, Amanda, and Christine.\n\nAlthough the police had been talking to Tommy since he was in a different grade, he first told them that someone named Gina molested him about a week before he testified. Tutti's friend Yvonne never molested him. Someone named Carla was also involved in molesting Tommy and the\n\nothers. Carla had some little kids and drove an old white car. She was not Gina. Carla was present most of the 20 times nasty things happened at the green house. Sometimes she brought her kids. Sometimes her son would be molested.\n\nOne day, Tommy and his brothers went swimming at the North High swimming pool. Although there were no doors on the toilets, Doug and Steve brought Tommy and his brothers into the rest room, leaned them up against the wall and put their privates in the boys' rear ends. No one walked by while this was happening. Carla stood outside of the door. After this incident, Carla and the men drove the boys around in the parking lot. Carla, not Gina, drove the car, which was old and white. Doug and Steve put their privates in the boys' mouths. Carla sucked Tommy's penis. They then dropped the boys off and Janice picked them up.\n\nThere was a time in August 1984, when Janice, Tommy, and his brothers were at a gymnastics meet at school. Tommy saw Doug and Steve, and Janice called the police. After school started the year of trial, Tommy and his brothers and Janice were driving by an apartment and Tommy identified one Vicki as being involved in the molestations. Vicki, who was a friend of Tutti's, had children. The children were not present on the 20 times the nasty things happened, although Vicki was sometimes there.\n\nDuring the time nasty things were happening at the green house, they were also happening at Clovette's house. One weekend they would happen at the green house, then the next weekend they would happen at Clovette's house. The same adults and children were present. Tommy could not recall if he was molested at Carla's house, but bad things also happened to him at the Knotty Pine.\n\nTommy told Janice and his father what had happened two or three weeks after Rick and Tutti went to Oklahoma. He only mentioned Tutti, Rick, and Colleen as being involved because he was too scared to tell about everybody.\n\nAmanda B., date of birth April 25, 1979, daughter of Colleen.\n\nAmanda was not quite six years old at the time she testified. She had stayed in the green house about two years before trial and could remember being there when kids and older people all took off their clothes. Rick would threaten to kill the people if they did not do it. The people would leave their clothes outside on the front porch. The children present were Amanda, Windy, Christine, Brandy, Bobo, Johnny, Brian, Tommy, Carol, and Carol's sister.\n\nWhen the kids had their clothes off in the green house, they would have to lie on somebody and touch the other kids in the private place. Brian lay on Amanda and touched her with his finger in her front private place. Dill took pictures; there was only one camera. There were three lights, not on stands, which were close to the camera. One was in Colleen's room, one in \"our\" room, and one in Rick and Tutti's room. The light in the room where things happened was bright.\n\nA lot of the kids had to touch each other in their private places. The nasty stuff happened in the room in which Carol and Lisa slept. Rick put powder on the private parts of all the children. Rick pointed the knife at their stomachs and the gun at their brains. Rick made \"all the nice people\" do it to the children. The nice people did not want to, but Rick made them.\n\nSometimes the kids would touch older people, too. They would not have to touch Grace. They would have to touch Tutti, Colleen, Grace (some of the kids did), all of the grownups that were there and Rick, and the other people that Rick made do it. The boys had to touch the ladies with their privates. Rick told them not to tell or he would kill them.\n\nRick would make the kids get on a board and hang them up if the kids did not do what he said. There were handcuffs on the board. Windy got hung up.\n\nAmanda saw someone put a \"poison thing\" on the penny table in the girls' room. It was a piece of candy, but she could tell it was poison because there were sprinkles on it. The piece of poisoned candy remained on the table for two years before Colleen threw it out.\n\nIn the kids' room, she saw someone put a straw in the powder and make the kids smell the powder. All the kids had to do that. The kids would have to touch men's penises. She never saw a child use his or her mouth on the older people. The children had to touch the women's breasts. Brian was the only one of the kids who touched Amanda.\n\nAmanda saw Rick put a screwdriver in the bottoms of the kids. Amanda also testified that Rick did not put a screwdriver in anyone's bottom, but he made another man do this. The man was only at the green house one time, and he only used the screwdriver on Brandy. Rick gave Amanda shots in the upper, outer portion of her left hand, midway between the knuckles and the wrist. Everyone had to smoke dope. It made Amanda throw up. Amanda subsequently testified that Colleen smoked pot and let Amanda smoke some in her bedroom. Amanda did not get sick from the pot, but she threw up one time in the living room.\n\nGrace was nice to Amanda. Grace never did anything mean to Amanda, nor did Amanda see her do mean things to anyone else. Rick only put handcuffs on Windy and Amanda. Grace never cuffed Amanda, but she was there when it happened, with Rick in Amanda's room. It happened lots of times and Grace was there every time. Grace never took pictures of Amanda, but Grace and Colleen were at the green house when Amanda had her clothes off. Grace never touched Amanda's body.\n\nMost of the things Rick made Amanda do were in the living room of the green house. When Amanda was cuffed, her hands were behind her back. She saw Windy, Grace, Colleen, and Forsythe all handcuffed. They were cuffed by \"one of those other guys that Rick made do it.\" Amanda saw her Uncle Wayne (Dill) at the green house taking pictures. She did not know his last name. She was locked up at the time. She did not see him taking pictures because she could not turn around, but she knew he was. Christine was looking out the window and saw Uncle Wayne and whispered to Amanda. Amanda did not see Uncle Wayne at the green house at this time because she was hung up. Rick made Brian do nasty things to Amanda. Rick did not do anything to her, nor did Tommy. When Brian did these things, it was in the room shared by Carol, Lisa, Amanda, and Windy. Amanda and Brian were alone. Then Brian could not do it to her anymore because Rick made another guy lock Amanda up.\n\nEvery time the nasty things happened, Rick and Tutti kept their clothes on. Everyone else took theirs off. Amanda left her clothes on the front porch of the green house every time she went there and took off her clothes. Everyone, together, took off their clothes on the front porch. Sometimes this happened in the daytime. Amanda subsequently testified the people never undressed on the front porch in the daytime.\n\nWhen the police came to the front door to make arrests, Amanda was hung up on the handcuffs. She was not there when Rick was arrested because Joe the bailiff took the handcuffs off Amanda and let all of the kids out of the house. Joe then called some other cops to take Rick in, and they took the kids to Shalimar (a child care shelter). Rick did not put cuffs on Amanda or Windy or Colleen or Grace.\n\nWhen Amanda was led from the witness stand to identify the defendants, she stated she did not know Gina. At one point, she also said she did not see Uncle Wayne in the courtroom.\n\nWindy B., date of birth April 29, 1975, daughter of Colleen.\n\nAbout 2 years before trial, Windy went to the green house 10 to 20 times when nasty things happened. On two different occasions, a group of adults\n\nwas present. It was not the same group both times. This all happened before Rick left for Oklahoma in August 1983.\n\nOne of the two episodes took place during the morning in the living room. The adults present were Rick, Tutti, Grace, Colleen, Forsythe, Clovette, Cliffy, Gina, Vicki Raye, Carla Joyce, and Linda Pitts Cardoso. Linda was present during the nasty things just a few times. There was also an adult man whose name Windy did not know. He was fat, mean, over six feet tall, wore his long black hair in a pony tail, and had lots of scars and tattoos. This was the only adult whose name Windy did not know. As far as she knew, there was no Doug or Steve present. The children present were Windy, Amanda, Bobo, Brandy, Christine, Tommy, Johnny, Brian, Carol, Lisa, Kenny, Joshua, and Angela. The latter three were Vicki's children.\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e11\u003c/span\u003e\n\nWhen the nasty things happened in the living room, it was daytime on a Saturday. Colleen and Gina took Windy and Amanda to the green house. Some of the adults were already there; some arrived later. At some point in time, all the adults and children had their clothes off. Rick had a knife that folded. The fat man had a black gun. He told Windy, Amanda, and some of the other children that he would hurt them if they told. Rick told the boys he would cut off their dicks if they said anything.\n\nBefore the nasty things happened, Colleen took Johnny, Tommy, and Brian to the back of the house. When they returned about 15 minutes later, they were giggly and acted like they were having trouble standing up. The boys said they had gotten a shot. Windy did not see them get the shots. She thought this happened only once.\n\nRick and the fat man ordered Windy to touch Johnny on his private spot, where he goes pee. The adults did not make her put her mouth on any part of Johnny's body, but they made Johnny touch her on her private spot. The big fat man and Rick ordered her to touch Tommy, Brian and Bobo on their privates, and them to touch her on her privates.\n\nRick and the fat man also ordered Amanda to touch Brian's privates. Brian also touched Amanda's and Brandy's private spots. Christine and Carol touched Johnny's private spot. Johnny touched Carol on her private spot. Lisa and Tommy touched each other's privates. Rick and the fat man made Windy and Christine pee on the floor. The group of adults was watching and some were taking pictures when all of this occurred.\n\nRick made Windy, Christine, Brandy, Amanda, Carol, and Lisa touch his private. Windy had to put Rick's penis in her mouth. Rick also put his penis in her bottom. Rick also stuck his penis in the mouths and bottoms of Christine, Brandy, Amanda, Carol, and Lisa. The other adults were watching and more than one was taking pictures.\n\nForsythe touched Windy's private spot. He also put his private in her front private. The other adults were watching and people were taking pictures. Forsythe also put his penis between the legs of Carol, Lisa, Amanda, Christine, and Brandy. The other adults were watching and taking pictures.\n\nDill was present on this occasion. He was present about 10 of the times that nasty things happened. On this occasion, he was just watching and taking pictures. Windy subsequently testified she could not remember if Dill was present this time.\n\nWindy did not have to do anything nasty with the women. However, she saw Johnny, Tommy, Brian and Bobo touch the front privates of Grace, Colleen, Tutti, and Clovette. Windy did not see any of the boys lie on top of the women. Bobo, Tommy, Johnny, and Brian all put their mouths on the privates of Clovette, Tutti, Colleen, and Grace. Vicki's children were also taking part in what was going on.\n\nWhile all the adults and children were there, Forsythe, Dill, Rick, Cliffy, Colleen, Tutti, Clovette, and the big fat man were smoking pot. Windy did not see anyone drinking liquor or beer.\n\nOn this occasion in the living room, Windy saw three cameras. There were also three bright lights on tables. After the nasty things occurred, someone poured white powder all over a table. The adults sniffed it through their noses. Sometimes they used a straw. The men had the cameras, although Windy could not recall who. Rick and the fat man acted like they were bosses. They told everyone what to do.\n\nOn some occasion, Forsythe made Windy put her mouth on his penis. She did not see what his penis looked like. She had seen him in shorts, barefoot, and shirtless when they lived in the same house. To her knowledge, he had no tattoos around his privates. Windy never saw any adult man's private at the green house.\n\nWindy could remember another time things happened in Rick and Tutti's room. It was perhaps two weeks after the time in the living room. The adults present were Rick, Tutti, Clovette, Cliffy, Colleen, Grace, Dill, Vicki, Carla Joyce, Gina, Forsythe, and the big fat man. Windy testified later that\n\nneither Grace nor Vicki was present during the incident in Rick and Tutti's room. The children present were Windy, Amanda, Christine, Bobo, Brandy, Carol, Lisa, Johnny, Tommy, Brian, Kenny, Joshua, and Angela. All of the adults and children were present in the room. Furniture in the room consisted of two dressers, a water bed, and two night stands. This happened during the daytime on a Saturday.\n\nOn this occasion, Colleen brought Windy and Amanda to the green house. The adults and children had their clothes off. The big man had a gun; Rick had a knife. They looked like the same weapons as before. One camera was there; Windy could not recall who had it. The big fat man told Windy that if she said anything, she would be hurt bad. He had the gun pointed behind him. Rick told Bobo that if he said anything, Rick would get him. Windy did not see Rick or the fat man touch a weapon to any part of the boys' bodies.\n\nOn this occasion, Rick put white powder on the night stand. Rick, Colleen, Forsythe, Dill, Tutti, Clovette, and Cliffy put it up their noses by putting their noses to the table. Windy did not see anyone smoking pot.\n\nWindy and Christine peed in Rick and Tutti's room. If they had to go, they had to go on the floor. Rick told them that rule. The other adults were watching.\n\nWindy was one of the children who had to do nasty things to other children's bodies. Rick told Johnny and Windy to touch each other's private spots; he did the same with Amanda and Brian, Carol and Johnny, and Lisa and Tommy, and also had Christine touch Johnny's private. The adults were watching.\n\nDuring this episode, Windy saw Johnny, Tommy, Brian, and Bobo lie on top of a girl. Johnny lay on top of Windy, Christine, and Carol. His private was on Windy's private. Rick told him to do this. Johnny lay on the other girls the same way. The adults were watching. Tommy and Bobo lay on top of Lisa. Brian lay on Amanda and Brandy. Windy also saw some of the girls put their mouths on the boys' privates and vice versa. Johnny put his mouth on Windy's private. Rick told him to. Tommy and Bobo put their mouths on Lisa's privates. Brian put his mouth on Amanda and Brandy. Carol, Christine, Windy, Brandy, Lisa, and Amanda had to put their mouths on the privates of Tommy, Johnny, Brian, and Bobo. Rick told them to. The adults had their clothes on and were watching.\n\nThe adults also did nasty things to the kids. Rick put his mouth on Windy's private spot. He was undressed at the time. He touched Amanda's\n\nprivate spot with his hands. He also touched the private spots of Christine, Carol, and Brandy. Also on this occasion, Rick put his penis in the bottoms of Windy, Christine, Brandy, and Amanda. Forsythe put his penis in the bottoms of Windy, Christine, Carol, Lisa, Brandy, and Amanda. Windy, Christine, Carol, Lisa, Brandy, and Amanda put their mouths on his private spot. No one ever put a private in Windy's front part.\n\nAlthough Dill was present when this was going on, Windy did not see him do nasty things with any of the kids. However, Bobo, Brian, Johnny, and Tommy all lay on top of Tutti and put their mouths on her privates. In addition, Johnny, Tommy, and Bobo lay on top of Grace and put their mouths on Grace's privates. Johnny, Tommy, Brian, and Bobo put their mouths on Colleen's privates. They also lay on top of her. Windy never saw any of the adults put white powder on their privates.\n\nThese same things happened a bunch of times in Lisa and Carol's room and involved the same group of children and adults. The girls' room was furnished with two bunk beds which were sometimes unstacked, a desk, two dressers, and an end table.\n\nWindy never watched television at the green house on the 10 to 20 times nasty things happened there. She never saw one of the adults with a screwdriver. Windy never saw any handcuffs at the green house nor did she see kids cuffed or tied up. Any time she was there, Amanda was there. She was with Amanda every weekend. During the time the nasty things were happening, Windy never stayed overnight at the green house or lived there. Amanda lived with Colleen and Windy the entire time.\n\nOn occasion when nasty things would happen, Windy, Amanda, and Colleen would undress on the front porch of the green house and leave their clothes on the porch. Windy never had to smoke pot at the green house, although the adults smoked it. She saw only adults sniffing the white powder. She never saw anyone put white powder on an adult's privates, nor did she see Rick urinate in a bottle, anyone drink urine, or anyone stick a gun in anyone's butt.\n\nBefore Windy was taken to Shalimar or ever talked to the police, Colleen and Rick threatened to kill her if she ever told. When she first talked to the police, she was scared that Rick and Colleen would carry out their threats. Also, she wanted to protect Grace and not get her into trouble. Neither Ms. Darling nor anyone else ever told her to do anything other than tell the truth. Windy admitted that she did not want her mother to get out of jail. She wanted to live with her father. Ms. Darling and coprosecutors Vendrasco\n\nand Gindes all told her that if she did not tell the court what Colleen did, Colleen would get out and it would happen again.\n\nBrian M., also known as \"B. J.,\" date of birth May 9, 1977, son of Tutti and John.\n\nBrian was almost eight at the time he testified. He could remember Rick and Tutti going to Oklahoma in the summer of 1983. Before then, Brian went to their house every other weekend. He recalled going over to the green house lots of times when there were a lot of older people and kids in the house without clothes on. Nasty things happened every time Brian visited the green house. They happened in the living room, Rick and Tutti's room, and the kids' room.\n\nOn the time Brian remembered best in Rick and Tutti's room, the adults present were Rick, Tutti, Colleen, Clovette, Forsythe, Dill, and Cliffy. They had their clothes off. There were also two men whose names Brian did not know. One had red hair to his waist and was fat. He had a gun and knife. The other had brown hair and was short. He had a mustache. Carol, Lisa, Bobo, Windy, Amanda, Brandy, Christine, Johnny, and Tommy were also there with their clothes off. There were also boys and girls there whose names Brian could not remember. The kids all took off their clothes because Rick told them to. Then the kids touched the other kids' privates. Sometimes they touched the adults' privates. Sometimes older people touched the kids' privates. Sometimes kids lay on top of other kids.\n\nOn this occasion, Rick had a knife eight or nine inches long. Rick pointed it at all of the kids. He pointed it at Johnny's privates and said, \"If you tell anybody, I will cut you.\" The red-haired man also had a knife. In addition, all of the men had guns. There were six guns altogether: two in Rick and Tutti's room, two in the girls' room, and two in the living room. Doug and Steve picked up the guns in the girls' room, but no one picked up the guns on the sofa in the living room. They were real guns, .22 pistols. When Cliffy caught Johnny and Bobo trying to pick up and throw those guns, he picked the kids up and threw them in the bedroom. The guns were black and brown and they were pointed at all the kids, even the girls.\n\nOn this occasion, Forsythe put a gun up Brian's butt. He did it twice that same day. The gun went inside Brian's butt hole; it hurt a little bit. Forsythe did it to Brian two times a day every time nasty things happened at the green house. On the day in Rick and Tutti's room, all of the people with guns stuck the guns in Brian's butt. Brian did not tell the police about that because he did not want to. He did tell Janice. All of the children had a gun\n\nput in their butts by all the men. This happened to all the children every time.\n\nOn this time Brian remembered best, in Rick and Tutti's room, Johnny touched Christine, and Johnny and Windy touched each other. Johnny touched Windy's privates with his privates. Johnny also lay on top of Windy and went up and down. Tommy also touched Christine and Windy. He touched Lisa's privates and lay on top of her. Tommy did the same with Christine and Windy; each got on top of the other and their privates touched.\n\nIn Rick and Tutti's room, all the children touched the privates of every other child. Amanda touched Brian with her hand on his privates. He did not see her touch any other boy. Each got on top of the other. When Brian was on top of Amanda, his privates touched hers. Rick told him to move up and down on her. Brian had to do this because Rick said he would beat Brian with a belt buckle and Tutti would burn him with a knife. In addition, Bobo got on top of Windy and went up and down. Every time, Rick told the boys to get on top. Also giving orders were the man who had the knife and the gun, and both Waynes. Additionally, all the boys put their mouths on the girls' privates, i.e., between their legs. The girls also put their mouths on the boys' privates, i.e., on their penises.\n\nBrian saw someone taking pictures of the nasty things happening. There were two cameras and two lights. Cliffy and Dill used one of the cameras. Rick used another one.\n\nIn Rick and Tutti's room, all the adults and children sat in a circle and passed around a cigarette that Rick said contained pot. The children all had to smoke it. On this occasion, Rick touched all the children on their privates. Rick put his privates in all of the children's rear ends. Cliffy took pictures of this. Rick put his penis in the girls' front privates and went up and down. Rick touched Brian's penis and put his privates in Brian's rear end. He went up and down. It hurt. His private went inside Brian's rear end. Rick put powder on his private first. He also put oil on his penis and made Brian suck it. Rick did this a lot in his and Tutti's room. Sometimes he made Brian suck his penis. Powder would be on Rick's penis. His penis would be big and get bigger. Then white stuff came out of Rick's penis and Rick told Brian to drink it.\n\nRick put baby powder on his (Rick's) privates. Brian never saw any powder in a little bottle. On the time he remembered best in Rick's room, Brian did not have to lick anything on Rick's body. Brian did have to put\n\nhis mouth on Rick's penis when the penis had powder on it. Rick told him to do this.\n\nRick told Brian to put his mouth on Rick's lips and kiss him. Rick told him he would beat Brian otherwise. Brian's tongue went into Rick's mouth and Rick put his tongue in Brian's mouth. Someone took a picture. This happened once in Rick and Tutti's room.\n\nSomeone always filmed the acts. Brian saw pictures of the nasty things on television the next morning. He did not see what happened to the photographs taken with the smaller camera, although he did see Tutti hide those pictures up on the closet shelf where nobody would see them.\n\nBrian had to drink beer out of a bottle, but no whiskey. In Rick and Tutti's room, he saw Rick pee in a cup on one occasion only. After that, Brian had to drink the pee or Rick said he would beat him. Brian also saw Amanda, Christine, Lisa, Carol, Johnny, Tommy, and Bobo drink pee. Both Rick and Tutti peed in the same cup and the boys had to drink it. This happened in Rick and Tutti's bedroom when everyone was there, but no one took pictures of it and Brian had his clothes on. In addition, Brian saw Windy and Christine pee on the floor of Rick and Tutti's room. Rick told them to.\n\nAlso in Rick and Tutti's room, Brian had to put his mouth on Forsythe's private. Forsythe put his private inside Brian's rear end. Forsythe put his private in the rear ends of all the children. He also put his private on the front private of the girls, i.e., the part between their legs. He did this to all the girls.\n\nWhen Forsythe put his penis in Brian's bottom in Rick and Tutti's room, it hurt, but not bad enough to make Brian cry. Brian could feel Forsythe inside him, but he did not bleed. When Forsythe put his penis in Carol's bottom, she \"screamed to death.\" Brian did not see her bleed. Lisa also screamed, and she also bled a lot. Lisa got mad at Forsythe and went in her bedroom and slammed the door. Amanda screamed loudly and cried. She also bled, but not very much. Brandy also screamed for two minutes straight. Christine screamed but did not bleed. Tommy also screamed when Forsythe did it to him. When Forsythe did it to Johnny, Johnny said, \"You better stop it.\" Forsythe told him to shut up. Forsythe did this to the children one right after the other. Everyone else was watching.\n\nRick did the same thing to all the children, one right after the other, after Forsythe did it. All of the children were lying lined up on the bed. Every child screamed. All the girls bled. Brandy bled the most. Afterward, Rick\n\nput his penis in the front private of all the girls. They were lined up on the bed. Christine \"[s]creamed bloody murder.\" She bled a little bit. Carol, Lisa, Amanda, and Windy also screamed and bled. When Rick gave orders, he screamed them louder than the children screamed. There was also real loud music going when the events were happening.\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e12\u003c/span\u003e\n\nDill was present in Rick and Tutti's room. He had his clothes on. Brian did not see Dill touch a child; Dill just watched and took pictures of the nasty things. Grace was also present. Her clothes were off. Brian did not see a child put his or her mouth anywhere on Grace. Grace did nasties to the boys. She went up and down on Johnny.\n\nTutti was in the room without her clothes. She did nasty things with all the girls and boys. All the women did it to the girls. Brian did not see any of the children put their mouths on Tutti. Tutti did the same things to the girls that the men did to the boys. She went up and down on all the girls. Brian did not have to do anything with Tutti. Tutti never put her privates on him.\n\nIn Rick and Tutti's room, Brian saw Johnny put his mouth on Grace's breast. Brian did not see him do this with any of the other women. Brian did not put his mouth on any of the women's breasts. Brian did not see any of the girls put their mouths on the women's privates. None of the women put their mouths on Brian's privates, nor did he have to lie on top of any of the women in Rick and Tutti's room.\n\nColleen was also present with her clothes off in Rick and Tutti's room. She got on top of the girls and touched her privates to theirs. Brian did not see anyone put his or her mouth on Colleen's breasts. Brian did not have to touch any part of Colleen's body with his mouth or anything. He did not see any of the boys put their mouths on her.\n\nSomeone named Carla was present in the green house when these nasty things were going on. Brian did not know Carla's last name. Brian knew a person by the name of Gina, but she was not there. At trial, he identified Gina as Carla. He did not remember her being in the green house, at least\n\nnot when they were smoking pot. However, when the other stuff happened to the children, she was there.\n\nAll of the children got on top of Tutti in Rick and Tutti's room. Brian had to put his private on her private and move. Rick told him to. This happened more than once. He did not have to put his mouth on Tutti. Grace, Rick, Clovette, and Cliffy touched Brian's private with their hands. Clovette had her clothes off. Clovette also touched the privates of Johnny, Tommy, Bobo, Christine, Windy, and Amanda. Clovette put her privates on the privates of Brian and the other children. In Rick and Tutti's room, all the other people touched Brian's privates. He had to put his mouth on all the men's penises. All the kids had to put their mouths on all the men's penises and on the women's private parts.\n\nOn a different occasion, nasty things happened in the girls' room. This was before Rick and Tutti went to Oklahoma. Nasty things happened in the girls' room all the time. Colleen did nasty things with the children there. So did Grace, all the times. She did nasty things to all the kids. She went up and down on them and sucked all the boys' penises. This happened in Rick and Tutti's room, and in Carol and Lisa's room. All of the boys sucked Grace's breasts in the girls' room. The boys did this to all the women. All the boys, including Brian, put their mouths on Colleen's breasts. Brian put his mouth on Tutti's breasts a couple of times. All of the boys put their mouths between the legs of Grace, Colleen, Clovette, and Carla. The boys did not suck Carla's breasts, nor did Brian see any of the boys do it to Tutti.\n\nBrian saw handcuffs inside the green house. They were up on a wall in Carol and Lisa's room. Rick put cuffs on all the kids, then tied them on the board, got a needle gun, and shot them in the leg. The children were then molested. Rick, Cliffy, and both Waynes molested the children while they were on the board.\n\nThe board was on the floor. Rick put Brian on the board and tied him on with ropes. Brian also had handcuffs on. Rick, Cliffy, both Waynes, and an old man with a red Porsche then shot him with the needle gun. Then nasty things happened. Brian and Amanda went up and down. Cliffy took a picture of it.\n\nRick put powder on his own penis in the girls' room. There was also powder on a little table in that room. Rick set the powder on the table in a small jar. All the kids had to smell the powder out of a straw.\n\nOn this time Brian remembered best in the girls' room, the children present with their clothes off were Brian, Johnny, Tommy, Bobo, Amanda,\n\nChristine, \"and that is all.\" It was the same children who took their clothes off in Rick and Tutti's room, including Lisa, Carol, Windy, Brandy, and the other kids that Brian mentioned. The older people touched the kids and the kids touched the older people, and the kids touched other kids. All of the kids had to touch the other kids' privates. Brian had to touch the privates of Amanda and Brandy. Tommy had to touch Windy and Lisa. All the boys touched the girls' privates with their mouths. Amanda touched Brian's penis. Windy, Amanda, and Christine touched the penises of all the boys. Carol touched Johnny and Bobo with her mouth. Lisa touched Brian and Bobo with her mouth. Brandy touched Brian with her mouth.\n\nAll the kids put their mouths on the adults' privates. Brian saw kids put their mouths between Grace's, Colleen's, and Tutti's legs. Brian saw kids put their mouths on the breasts of Colleen, Tutti, and \"especially Grace.\" Brian put his mouth on the breasts of Clovette, Carla, and Grace. He also put his mouth between Grace's legs. He did not put his mouth on Tutti's breasts or between her legs. He put his mouth on Colleen's breasts a couple of times. He did not lie on top of Tutti in the girls' room. Rick threatened to kill Brian if he did not lick Tutti's privates, so Brian put his tongue between her legs. He did this one time. He also had to stick his tongue up Clovette and lick between Colleen's legs.\n\nRick did not put anything in Brian's mouth in the girls' room, but he touched Brian's behind with his penis. Rick put his penis inside Brian's rear end one time. He only did it in one room, on one day.\n\nIn the girls' room, all the boys lay on top of all the girls. Cliffy took a picture of this. There were two cameras, one big and one little.\n\nOn one occasion in Lisa and Carol's room, Brian had to suck Rick's penis. Brian had to do this in the two bedrooms, but not at all in the living room. Rick gave Brian what he said was whiskey and made Brian drink it. In addition, Rick urinated in a white cup and made Brian, Johnny, Bobo, and Tommy drink it.\n\nIn the girls' room, Forsythe put his penis in the behinds of Brian, Tommy, Johnny, and Bobo. Forsythe had some words tattooed on his penis. Dill put his penis in the behinds of the same boys. When Rick put his penis in Brian's behind in the girls' room, it only hurt a little. Rick used greasy stuff, but he did not put it on Brian's behind before inserting his penis. Rick used powder on his private. When Rick put his penis in Brian's mouth, Brian had to swallow white stuff one time.\n\nEvery time Brian got shots at the green house, he was given shots by Rick, both Waynes, Cliffy, and the old man in the red Porsche. On the day\n\nBrian remembered in Rick and Tutti's room, this old man took off his clothes and put his penis in all the kids' behinds. All the kids had to put their mouths on the man's penis. When the man took his clothes off, he had his gun with him. Brian saw the man bring the needle gun into the house in a plastic bag that closed with a black zipper. The needle gun looked like a handgun.\n\nBrian first testified he was given five or six shots in the upper left leg every other weekend. He never noticed any needle marks on his leg. The shots were always in the same spot on his inner thigh, about four to five inches above his knee. All the kids got five or six shots. The shots left a three- to four-inch black and blue spot, but Brian never showed Janice. Brian and his brothers could not walk for a day after the shots. They had trouble walking and just sat around for a day every weekend that they returned from visiting. Janice never asked what was wrong.\n\nBrian later retracted his testimony that he was given five or six shots every other weekend and stated that he only got one shot. He changed his testimony because Vendrasco told him he answered the question wrong and made a mistake, although Vendrasco did not tell him he should say one shot.\n\nThe time Brian remembered best in Rick and Tutti's room happened when Brian was five. The time in Carol and Lisa's room was before the time in Rick and Tutti's room. The nasty things went on for two years. They always happened on a Sunday, usually around noon time. Brian could not remember any time that he was at the green house when something nasty did not happen to him. Every time it happened, Grace was there.\n\nBrian did not tell Janice about the nasty things right away because he was afraid of Rick. He told Mr. Silvius and his kindergarten teacher before he told Janice. However, he told his father every Sunday evening right after he got home from the green house. Brian subsequently testified that he waited \"a long time\" to tell his father. When Brian first talked to a police officer, he did not tell about everything because he was afraid of being beaten by Rick, even though Rick was in Oklahoma. Brian admitted telling some lies to the officer just because he wanted to.\n\nBrian had not heard of a lady named Linda Pitts. However, a lady named Linda was present when nasty things happened. She was there almost all the time. She was there the time Brian remembered best in Rick and Tutti's room. She was not there the time in Carol and Lisa's room. Someone named Yvonne was there lots of times. So was someone named Vicki. Both were there the two times Brian testified about. Vicki had her clothes off; Brian\n\ncould not remember about Yvonne or Linda. Doug and Steve were also there. Sometimes their clothes were on, sometimes off. Doug and Steve were in Rick and Tutti's bedroom with their clothes off. They were also in Carol and Lisa's bedroom, but their clothes were on. Brian did not recall children named Kenny, Joshua, or Angela being present during the nasty things. There was a child named Jed present, though, both in Rick's and the girls' rooms. (Gina's son, Jeremy, was nicknamed \"Jed.\")\n\nLisa P., date of birth April 3, 1977, daughter of Rick.\n\nAt the time of trial, Lisa lived with her mother, Linda Pitts Cardoso, Linda's husband, Dimas Cardoso, and Lisa's sister, Carol.\n\nLisa testified that nasty things did not happen at the green house, but admitted she may have told Gindes that Linda told her to say that. Linda did not, however, tell her what to say. Similarly, Lisa testified she never lied to Carol Darling, but denied telling Ms. Darling that bad things happened to her. According to Lisa, if Ms. Darling testified to that effect, she would be lying.\n\nThe second time Lisa talked with Ms. Darling, she told the truth. Lisa told Ms. Darling that it was hard and embarrassing to talk about things that happened at Rick and Tutti's house. Lisa admitted that Ms. Darling asked when the nasty things happened and Lisa said before they went to Oklahoma; however, nothing nasty happened before they went to Oklahoma and Lisa did not tell Ms. Darling that they did. Lisa also admitted that Ms. Darling asked who was at Rick and Tutti's house when the nasty things happened. Lisa told her Johnny, Tommy, Brian, Lisa, Carol, Yvonne, Tutti, Rick, and Angela. However, nothing nasty happened and Lisa did not tell Ms. Darling those people were there. Lisa told Ms. Darling Tutti was there when nasty things happened. That was the truth. Nothing happened:\n\n\"By Mr. Gindes:\n\n\"Q Was Tutti There When Nasty Things Happened?\n\n\"A [by Lisa] Yes.\n\n\"Q What Nasty Things Happened When Tutti Was There?\n\n\"A Yes.\n\n\"Q What Happened?\n\n\"A Nothing.\n\n\". . .\n\n\"Q Now, I Think That You -- Did You Just Tell Us That Tutti Was There When Nasty Thing Happened?\n\n\"A Yes, There Was No Nasty Things at All.\"\n\nAccording to Lisa, Ms. Darling asked Lisa to name the people that were there when nasty things happened. Lisa told her Tutti was there. She also said Rick. That was the truth. She also said Yvonne was there. Yvonne was not there when one child had to touch another child, because that never happened. Lisa told Ms. Darling that Yvonne had a daughter named Angela. That was the truth. Lisa did not tell Ms. Darling that Angela also had to do it. If Ms. Darling said Lisa said that, she would be lying. Lisa told Ms. Darling Angela did not like doing it. That was the truth. Lisa said she did not know what Angela did not like doing. Lisa told Ms. Darling that Angela did not like doing it because Angela did not. What did she not like doing? Nothing. Lisa also told Ms. Darling that nobody liked doing it. That was the truth. Lisa did not know what she meant when she told Ms. Darling that. Lisa told Ms. Darling that when nasty things happened, Johnny, Tommy, and Brian were also there. Lisa was telling Ms. Darling the truth; however, nasty things did not happen at the green house when they were there. Yet Lisa testified that she told Ms. Darling the truth when she said nasty things happened at the house. A short time later, she testified she was not telling the truth when she told Ms. Darling that.\n\nIf given her choice, Lisa would like to live with Rick and Tutti again.\n\nJohnny M., date of birth August 24, 1973, son of Tutti and John.\n\nIn the summer of 1983, Tutti and Rick went to Oklahoma. Prior to that time, Johnny visited them every other weekend in the green house. He started visiting them in the green house in 1982. He was in fourth grade at the time.\n\nNasty things happened on lots of visits at the green house. The group of people present would change, but there were a number of people who were there lots of times the nasty things happened. Those who were there a lot of the times were Rick, Tutti, Clovette, Colleen, Cliffy, Grace, Gina (Carla), Doug, Steve, a lot of strangers Johnny did not know, Dill, Forsythe, and another Carla who was not present in court.\n\nAt trial, Johnny stated that the name \"Gina\" was not familiar to him and identified Gina as \"Carla.\" For the sake of clarity, unless otherwise noted we will refer to Gina as Gina, regardless of the name Johnny used. Johnny identified a picture of Colleen and the Carla who was not present in court. The picture was of Carla Joyce. Carla Joyce was subsequently brought into court, where Johnny identified her as being one of the people at the green house who molested him. He called her \"Carla.\"\n\nDoug had blond hair worn a little past his shoulders and was medium height. He looked strong. He was a slob and had tattoos up and down his arms. Steve was short with blackish or dark brown hair. He was a little fat and had a mustache. He was Doug's friend. There was also a lady in the group named Vicki.\n\nWhen the nasty things happened, there would be a group of children there. Occasionally one or two children would be missing. The children who were there a lot of times were Johnny, Tommy, Brian, Bobo, Christine, Windy, Amanda, Carol, Lisa, Brandy, and four children Johnny did not know -- these were four boys who left with a man and lady, neither of whom Johnny knew. The man and lady did not do nasty things, they just stayed in another room.\n\nOne time nasty things happened at the green house was on the Saturday of Tommy's track meet, following the meet. The adults present were Rick, Tutti, Clovette, Colleen, Cliffy, Grace, Gina, Doug, Steve, Forsythe, and about seven or eight strangers. The other Carla (Joyce) was not there. The children present were Tommy, Brian, Bobo, Christine, Windy, Amanda, Carol, Lisa, Brandy, and Johnny. The unknown children were not there that time, nor was Vicki.\n\nOn this occasion, the nasty things happened in Rick and Tutti's room. It was around lunch time. The children were told to go into the bathroom and take off their clothes. Doug, Forsythe, and Rick were acting like bosses and telling people what to do. Tutti and Rick told the children to remove their clothes. All of the children and all of the adults took off their clothes before they went into Rick and Tutti's room.\n\nThere were two cameras in the room. Cliffy used one and Forsythe the other. Doug and Steve also used them occasionally. The cameras were used when the nasty things were happening. There were two or three lights that were different from ordinary lights. They would be on the place where the nasty things were happening, and the cameras would be pointed toward that place.\n\nJohnny later testified that on this occasion, 13 adults and 14 children were in Rick and Tutti's room at the same time. There were also the lights on stands, and there were three stands. The three lights were on all the time when Johnny was in the room. They did not change the room's temperature. Also in the room were a big water bed, one dresser, and the penny table.\n\nWe note that, according to prosecution witness Toby Tyler, lights used in semiprofessional pornography are usually quartz lights which give off a substantial amount of light and heat. People closer than six feet would be made uncomfortable by the heat. Within two feet, sustained exposure would cause a second degree burn.\n\nWe also note that Roger Ruby, a private investigator, measured Rick and Tutti's bedroom. The depth of the room from the door from the kitchen to the wall was 10 feet 8 inches. The length of the room was 11 feet 2 inches. In the lower right hand part of the room was an inset where the refrigerator sat in the kitchen. From the north end going south for about three feet eight inches, the room was only nine feet, one inch wide. The length of the room at that spot was cut down to seven feet six inches. When the water bed was placed in the room, the measurement from the bed to the outside wall with the window was one foot nine inches. The measurement from the foot of the bed to the wall where the bathroom door was located was two feet seven inches. Ruby did not measure the other bedroom; however, to him it appeared about the same length-wise, and probably one-half times as big otherwise as the room he measured.\n\nJohnny testified that on this occasion, Doug had a black handgun. Steve had a knife seven or eight inches long that did not fold. Doug and Steve said that if the children did not do something, they would hurt the children. Steve placed the knife to Johnny's penis and said he would cut it off if Johnny did not do the nasty stuff. He also put the knife to Johnny's throat and said he was going to slice Johnny's throat. This scared Johnny. Steve said that if Johnny told, he would hurt Johnny. Doug pointed the gun at Johnny's head and clicked it. Doug said he would kill Johnny if Johnny told what was happening. Doug also put the gun to Johnny's rear end. Tutti was around when these threats were made, but neither she nor anyone else tried to protect Johnny.\n\nBoth the adults and children used drugs, during and after the nasty things. On this occasion in Rick and Tutti's room, the nasty things went on for four or five hours. During this time, Johnny was given two shots, one in his rear and one in his arm. The shots were given by Doug, about five\n\nminutes apart, and made Johnny feel drowsy. Johnny saw Doug give shots to all of the other children.\n\nRick and Tutti smoked pot a lot and taught Johnny what pot was. On the day nasty things happened in their room, during the time the things were happening, all of the children had to smoke their own pot cigarette and just about all of the adults also smoked some. It made Johnny feel like he was drunk. Johnny also drank whiskey on this occasion. Rick told him to. It made him feel a little drunk. Rick also made him drink half a can of beer. Rick also put some white powder in a line on the penny table and made all of the kids sniff it. Rick, both Waynes, and \"all of the guys\" also sniffed it. It made Johnny feel dizzier than any other thing. Rick called it angel dust.\n\nMore than one child was molested at the same time. Forsythe, Doug, and Steve gave the orders as to which child would be molested. No one else gave orders. Rick did not give orders, but he participated in the sex acts. All the kids tried to get away from him. Rick and some of the others disciplined the children to make them stop trying to get away. Rick was especially mean to Amanda.\n\nOn this occasion, Rick put lotion on his penis, then stuck his penis in Johnny's rear and moved up and down. Rick also put his penis in the butts of all the other children. One of the cameras was pointed at the child as Rick was doing this. Rick also put white powder on his penis and made Johnny and all the other kids suck it. Rick forced Johnny's head down to his penis and told Johnny to suck on his dick. Rick also made Johnny suck his penis a lot of other times. Sometimes stuff like \"snot\" came out of his penis. Rick told Johnny to swallow it.\n\nOn this occasion in Rick and Tutti's room, Johnny saw Rick urinate in a bottle. Rick then made Johnny drink the urine. Everyone watched and Cliffy took pictures. Rick also made Bobo, Windy, Brandy, Tommy, and Brian drink it. When kids had to go to the bathroom, Rick would tell them to pee on the floor. Rick wanted them to stay in the room. Windy is the only one Johnny saw pee on the floor at any time.\n\nJohnny later testified that in addition to himself, Carol, Lisa, Tommy, Brian, Bobo, Christine, Windy, Amanda, Brandy, and the four unknown boys drank urine from a bottle. It is unclear, however, whether this testimony related to the track-meet time.\n\nOn this occasion following the track meet, Doug stuck the gun up Johnny's rear end. He did it to all the boys. In addition, Johnny saw Rick get on top of Lisa and Windy while they were lying on their backs. Rick put his\n\npenis in their vaginas and went up and down. Johnny did not see any blood, but both girls screamed. Rick also put white powder on Tutti's vagina. Rick and Doug made Johnny and some of the other kids put their face down in it. Johnny had to put his tongue inside Tutti. Rick told him to do that. Doug and Cliffy had the cameras and the lights were shining on the private spots. Johnny saw Bobo, Tommy, Brian, Christine, and Windy put their mouths on Tutti's privates. Someone was filming this. Johnny also had to suck on Tutti's breasts. Someone was filming this. Johnny saw all the boys suck on Tutti's breasts at that time. Johnny also had to lie on Tutti. She told him to. His penis touched her vagina. Rick told him to move up and down. Rick called it humping. All the other boys also had to lie on top of Tutti, and Rick told them to move up and down.\n\nAlso on this occasion, Johnny had to suck Colleen's breasts. She told him to. Doug took pictures. Bobo, Christine, Amanda, Windy, Tommy, and Brian also had to do this. Johnny also had to lie on top of Colleen. She told him to. She also told him to go up and down. All the boys had to lie on top of her. Johnny, Tommy, Brian, Bobo, Amanda, and Christine also had to suck on Grace's breasts. All of them had to lie on her and move.\n\nJohnny testified that Grace had tattoos of cherries on either side of her buttocks. He also testified that Colleen has \"Bob\" tattooed above her pubic hair line; Forsythe has tattoos up and down his arms, on his chest and back and one not on his penis, but on the left side of it between his legs; and Rick has a tattoo on his back.\n\nDuring this episode, Dill stuck his penis in Johnny's rear. Dill used grease on his penis. Johnny also saw him stick his penis in all the kids' butts. Johnny also had to suck Dill's penis. All the children did it that day. In addition, Johnny had to do nasty things with Gina. Johnny had to lie on top of her. She told him to. She also told him to go up and down. Forsythe took pictures of this. Bobo, Tommy, Brian, and the four unknown boys also had to do it. Additionally, Johnny, Tommy, Brian, Bobo, Brandy, Windy, and Amanda had to suck her breasts. Johnny also had to suck Forsythe's penis and Forsythe put his penis in Johnny's butt.\n\nThere came a time that day when Forsythe started ordering children to do things with other children. This went on for about two hours. Someone would always be filming. On this occasion, Johnny did not have to do nasty things with Christine, but he had to stick his penis in Lisa's vagina while he was on top of her. Forsythe ordered him to do that. It was being filmed. Forsythe told Johnny to go up and down. Johnny had to do the same thing with Carol. Forsythe ordered him to. Tommy and Brian did the same thing with Lisa and Carol. Christine sucked all the boys' penises. Forsythe ordered\n\nher to. Christine did not do any other nasty things with the boys. Windy also played with and sucked the boys' penises. Forsythe ordered her to do that. Cliffy filmed these acts. Windy did not do anything else nasty with the boys. Amanda played with and sucked the penises of Johnny, Tommy, Brian, and Bobo.\n\nWhen the children squirmed around a lot, they were strapped to the board and given shots. Cliffy, Forsythe, Dill, Doug, Steve, and \"all the other guys\" did this. Only one child was strapped to the board at a time. Sometimes the child would be facing the ceiling, and sometimes face down on the board.\n\nJohnny was on the board on the track-meet time. Forsythe, Doug, and Steve gave him shots and spanked him with a belt. Someone filmed Johnny being tied to the board and whipped. All the kids took turns on the board. During the track-meet time, however, no nasty things were done to the kids while they were on the board.\n\nOn some occasions, the children were shown films of the nasty things on television. Johnny was shown such movies more than once. Doug would do the narration on the film. He would name the children and tell what they were doing. All the people would be in the room when the tape was shown. Rick would run the tape machine.\n\nJohnny could remember another time when nasty things happened in Rick and Tutti's room. The same things happened on both Saturday and Sunday. The time Johnny could remember the most things about happened in the afternoon. It was after Johnny's birthday in 1982, but before Rick and Tutti went to Oklahoma in 1983. Carol and Lisa lived in the green house at the time and were present when the nasty things happened. Johnny and his brothers were spending the weekend. Cliffy and Clovette brought Christine and Bobo to the house. Brandy was also there. Colleen brought Amanda and Windy. Forsythe was with them. Also present were the four unknown boys, Dill, Doug, Steve, Gina, Grace, Rick, Tutti, and five or six strangers. Some of the strangers were driving a fancy green car. Johnny did not see any other fancy cars.\n\nWhen the various people arrived, Johnny was watching television. Rick and Doug got there early and brought in and set up the video equipment. Rick and Doug did this all the time. Forsythe never helped set it up.\n\nEventually, Tutti, Rick, Doug, Steve, Forsythe, \"and everybody\" told the children to take their clothes off. All the adults and children ended up nude in Rick and Tutti's room. Rick, Doug, and Forsythe gave the orders to all\n\nof the kids that were there. Forsythe and Cliffy did the filming. A bunch of people did nasty things at the same time. They made the children suck their penises and stuck their penises in the children's rears. The ladies made the children suck their breasts and get on top of them. Someone also made the children lie on top of the girls. The girls had to play with the boys' penises. The boys had to put their mouths down by the girls' vaginas and the girls had to put their mouths on the boys' penises. Forsythe ordered them to do these things. While this went on, Doug and Steve had a gun and knife.\n\nOn this occasion, Rick put lotion on his penis, then sodomized Johnny. Rick did the same thing to Tommy, Brian, and Windy. Johnny later testified that Rick did this to all the other boys, but not to any of the girls on this occasion. Rick also made Johnny suck on his penis. Rick stuck his penis in Bobo's rear, and Bobo had to suck on Rick's penis. Christine had to suck on Rick's penis. Johnny did not see Rick touch the children's privates with his hand, nor did he see Rick do anything with Christine's privates on this occasion.\n\nDuring this episode, Rick urinated in a bottle, then put the bottle in Tutti's vagina and she urinated in it. Rick then made Johnny and his brothers drink it. Cliffy filmed it. Johnny subsequently saw this part on television with a voice telling what was happening.\n\nAlso on this occasion, Johnny had to put his face in Tutti's vagina and lick it. Rick told him to do this. Cliffy filmed it. Tommy and Brian also licked her vagina. Johnny also had to suck on Tutti's breasts. Rick told him to. Cliffy filmed it. Everyone was standing around watching. Rick also made Brian do this. Bobo also had to do that, as did \"a whole bunch of other kids.\" Johnny and the other kids also had to lie on Tutti. Rick told him to go up and down. Johnny's penis was touching Tutti's vagina. Johnny saw this happen with all the boys. Cliffy was filming. The rest of the adults were molesting other kids at the time.\n\nAlso on this occasion, Forsythe molested a bunch of kids. Johnny had to suck his penis, and Forsythe stuck his penis in Johnny's rear. Tommy and Brian sucked Forsythe's penis, and Forsythe stuck his penis in Brian's rear. Amanda also had to suck Forsythe's penis and Forsythe stuck his penis in her rear. In addition, Johnny had to suck on Colleen's breasts. The adults were all present, nude, when this was occurring. Forsythe was filming. Johnny also had to lie on Colleen with his penis touching her vagina while someone was filming it. Tommy and Brian also sucked her breasts. Bobo, Brian, and Johnny had to put their mouths on Colleen's vagina. Forsythe was filming. Additionally, Johnny, Tommy, and Brian had to suck Dill's penis. Forsythe filmed this. Grace was involved in the nasty things on this\n\noccasion, too, as was Gina. Dill, Doug, Forsythe, and Steve put their penises in the children's rears.\n\nDuring this incident, Windy played with Johnny's penis. Johnny had to lie on top of Christine. His penis touched her vagina. He went up and down on her. Christine touched and played with his penis. Forsythe filmed this. Johnny also had to lie on top of Carol. His privates touched her vagina. He also had to lie on top of Lisa. His penis touched her. Johnny did not see his brothers lie on top of Christine on this occasion. However, Brian had to lie on top of Amanda. Brian's penis touched her privates. Amanda played with Brian's penis. Forsythe was filming this. Johnny saw Windy playing with Bobo's penis.\n\nThe board was used on this occasion for shots. Johnny received two shots, beer, whiskey, and marijuana. The shots, which were administered about five minutes apart with something that looked like a needle for shots at a hospital, made him a little sleepy. Everybody got shots this time.\n\nIn addition to Rick and Tutti's room, nasty things happened more than once in Carol and Lisa's room. The time Johnny remembered best in the girls' room was a Saturday. On this occasion, the nasty things started about lunch time. Carol, Lisa, Johnny, Tommy, and Brian spent Friday night at the house, but the other children did not. The children who showed up were Bobo, Christine, Brandy, Windy, and the four unknown kids. Amanda was also there. Rick and Tutti were there. Of the adults, Doug and Steve showed up the earliest. Grace was there, as were Dill, Forsythe, Clovette, Gina, Cliffy, and some strangers.\n\nAt some point, everyone had their clothes off. The white powder, pot, and liquor were all used while the nasty things were going on. Rick put the white powder on a little table, not the penny table. All the kids sniffed it. Johnny did not see any of the adults sniff it. None of the adults put it on parts of their body. Some of the men put lotion on their privates. The adults did not molest the children on the floor, only on the beds. During the incident, Forsythe was using a camera.\n\nOn this occasion, Steve had a knife and Doug had a gun. Both threatened the children if the children would not do something. Amanda got yanked around and all the kids got yelled at.\n\nAt some point, Forsythe put down the camera and began molesting children himself. He stuck his penis in Johnny's rear and made Johnny suck his penis. Johnny saw Forsythe make the other children, including Amanda, suck on his penis. Forsythe also put his penis in Amanda's butt. Johnny\n\nhad to suck on Rick's penis, and Rick stuck his penis in Johnny's rear. Grace molested children, too. Johnny lay on top of her. He also sucked her breasts. Johnny also had to lie on top of Tutti. His penis touched her vagina. He had to lie on top of Gina and suck her breasts. All the boys did that. Tommy, Brian, and Bobo also had to lie on top of Grace. Forsythe ordered Bobo to lie on top of Christine. Bobo's penis was in her vagina. In addition, Tommy sucked Rick's penis and Rick put his penis in Brian's behind. Besides Rick and Forsythe, Doug, Dill, and Cliffy put their penises in Johnny's rear.\n\nNo adult named Yvonne was involved in the molestations. A child named Angela P. was involved and her mother was there, but her mother's name was not Yvonne. (In fact, Yvonne Mailloux, also known as Yvonne P., was Angela P.'s mother.) A woman named Vicki was involved. All the people in the green house called Gina \"Carla.\" Gina had three children, Jed, age eleven, and two girls younger than Brian. Gina's children were never present when molestations were occurring. Both Carlas were present the last time nasty things happened.\n\nJohnny never saw any handcuffs in the green house. He never saw any pistol except the one Doug had. It was a revolver and had a sight at the end. Doug, Steve, Cliffy, Dill, and Forsythe all put the gun up Johnny's butt. More than one man would do it on a single day.\n\nJohnny saw a red Porsche at the green house when bad things happened. A man would come to the green house alone in the red Porsche. He would touch Johnny sexually. The man had long hair and was about 50. His hair was grayish brown, down to his shoulders.\n\nJohnny did not tell the police initially because he was scared. If he had told, \"mean guys\" would have found out and he would have been hurt. Johnny did not tell the police about the red Porsche because they did not ask him.\n\nDuring cross-examination, Johnny testified that on one occasion he saw Doug and Steve at the swimming pool with a person he named as Carla. That was when they had him suck their penises in the rest room. Johnny and his brothers all basically had sex with Doug and Steve in the rest room at the North High swimming pool. There were no doors on the toilets in the rest room. There were lots of other kids and people at the swimming pool, and there were four or five kids coming in and going out of the rest room while these things were going on. No adults ever came in to put a stop to these things.\n\nGindes's relevancy objections regarding this incident were sustained as to all defendants except Gina. Subsequently, the prosecution's objections to the introduction of various photographs of the pool and buildings, as well as to the testimony from the lifeguard who was on duty at the pool June 9, 1984, were sustained.\n\nCarol P., date of birth February 3, 1973, daughter of Rick and his former wife Linda Pitts Cardoso.\n\nCarol was called to testify by the defense. A straight \"A\" sixth-grader at the time of trial, she was able to identify all of the defendants except Forsythe and Gina. She had seen Gina before and knew her to be a friend of Colleen's. She did not know who Forsythe was, although she had seen him before but did not know where.\n\nPrior to the move to Oklahoma, Tutti lived with Carol, Lisa, and Rick. During that time, Johnny, Tommy, and Brian would visit on weekends, every two weeks. They would arrive on Friday, sometime after school. Everyone would have supper together, which Tutti would fix. Afterward, Carol, Lisa, and the boys would play outside for about an hour. They would then watch television in the living room until about 10 p.m., at which time they would go to bed. Carol and Lisa would sleep each in her own bed in their room. The boys would sleep on the floor of the girls' room in sleeping bags.\n\nOn a typical Saturday, they would watch television when they got up. They would then have breakfast, play outside all morning, then eat lunch. In the afternoons, they would play and watch television. They would go to the park on Saturday evenings. They would eat supper at the green house, then play for a while and watch television after. On Sundays, they would eat breakfast, then play. The boys returned home on Sunday mornings.\n\nThere was never a time at the green house when Carol, Lisa, and the boys were there when any kind of nasty things happened between adults and children or between children and each other. There was no time when the children were nude and nude adults were also present. Rick had rifles and shotguns at the house, but Carol never saw any handguns. She never saw a board in the house or any child strapped to a board. She never saw a syringe at the house or any child get a shot.\n\nNo one, including a doctor, ever put anything up Carol's butt. She never had anything put inside her vagina. Carol never saw Rick stick his penis in children's butts at the green house, nor did she see him and Tutti molest children or give children shots. She never saw them snort white powder,\n\nalthough she saw them smoke pot. It happened when children were present, although not when Johnny, Tommy or Brian was there.\n\nCarol did not know how many times she saw Grace at the green house. She saw Cliffy and Clovette there lots of times. She saw Colleen there a few times. Carol never saw Forsythe at the green house; when Colleen visited, she did not bring her boyfriend with her. Carol did not know anyone named Carla Joyce, but she did know Vicki Pearce. She saw Vicki at the green house a couple of times. She knew Yvonne and had seen her at the green house a lot of times. She saw Amanda at the green house between five and ten times.\n\nDuring the time in question, Carol never saw any of the children pee on the floor of the green house. She did not remember going to see Tommy participate in a track meet. She never saw the M. boys drink beer or whiskey. Carol never saw Gina naked, talked to her about sexual matters, or had Gina try to do anything sexual to her. Carol never saw Dill on the weekends the M. boys were visiting the green house. Carol never saw a VCR at the green house, nor did she see a movie camera or one that works with a VCR there. She never saw a camera sitting on a tripod there, or any photographer's lights.\n\nWhen Rick was arrested, Carol talked to a lady from the sheriff's department. She told the lady that Rick and Tutti had not molested her and that she had never been molested when the M. boys were there. Carol told the lady that she had not been molested by Rick, Tutti, Colleen, Forsythe, Dill, or Grace. The people at the sheriff's department kept asking her questions over and over again, although they did not tell her what to say. They did not tell her it would be good if she said something, nor did they say they wanted her to tell lies. They put pressure on her, although she did not know how. They did not yell at her. Somebody, perhaps the lady, called her a liar. No one was mean to her. Ms. Darling was nice to Carol and very gentle. She did not yell, threaten Carol, or call her a liar. Carol felt comfortable with her.\n\nAngela P., eight years of age, daughter of Yvonne Mailloux, who was not charged as a victim but whose presence during the molestations was testified to by some of the children, was also called by the defense. She denied ever seeing any of the defendants naked at the green house or doing nasty things with children there. However, she had seen Rick, Tutti, and her mother Yvonne smoke pot.\n\nIV. The Defenses\n\nDill\n\nDefendant Dill testified that he only visited the green house a few times in 1982. One time was when his father came from Arkansas. Other than that, he only dropped by occasionally to tell Tutti that Grace wanted her. Dill did not even meet Rick until the latter part of 1982. In 1983, he only visited the green house on Easter, except for the times he stopped by to give Tutti messages from Grace or to look for Grace.\n\nDill denied ever molesting any of the children. He had no idea why the children would say such things, as he was never present when anyone did anything like that. The children were lying.\n\nDill worked at D \u0026 D Auto Sales on about half of the Saturdays during the time in question. He never left before noon.\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e13\u003c/span\u003e\n\nDuring the same time, Howze Auto Sales was located on the same lot. Dill occasionally worked for Don Howze, and the business was open Saturdays. Normally, however, only salespeople worked that day, and Dill was not a salesperson. Dill came in very seldom on Saturdays and did not regularly work Saturday mornings. The lot was usually open until around 3 p.m. on Saturday. Howze was not at the lot every Saturday.\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e14\u003c/span\u003e\n\nOn the weekends he was not working, Dill would spend time with Carol Forsythe, Wayne Forsythe's sister (hereinafter Ms. Forsythe) or his wife, Linda Dill (hereinafter Ms. Dill). He spent one or two weekends a month with Ms. Dill during November 1982 to June 1983. On some of the weekends he spent with Ms. Forsythe, he would still go to the pizza parlor where Ms. Dill worked and spend a couple of hours with her.\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e15\u003c/span\u003e\n\nAccording to Laura Dobbs, a neighbor of Ms. Forsythe's from January to April 1983, Dill was home most of the time on Saturdays. Although Dobbs did not consider Forsythe her boyfriend, she admitted she was in love with him. In letters written to her from jail, Forsythe promised to move in with her and her children if he were acquitted.\n\nAccording to Ms. Dill, Forsythe visited her about every other weekend during 1982 and 1983.\n\nMike Warren, one of Dill's coworkers at D \u0026 D Auto Sales, testified to seeing Dill on many Sundays during 1982. He saw Dill almost every single Saturday and Sunday in 1983.\n\nMilton Lee Spaulding, Ms. Forsythe's father, testified to seeing Dill and Ms. Forsythe part of almost every Saturday and Sunday from February to approximately May 1983. There were some Sundays when Dill and Ms. Forsythe spent the entire day with Spaulding and his wife. A couple of times they did this on successive Sundays.\n\nTutti\n\nTutti described a typical weekend when the boys visited at the green house. She usually picked the boys up between 5 and 6 p.m. on Friday, then the boys would return to Janice and their father between 6 and 7 p.m. on Sunday. On a typical weekend, Rick would work Friday nights and would not get home until 9 or 10. On Saturday, Tutti would fix breakfast and everyone, including Rick, would watch cartoons. Sometimes the kids would then go outside, or everyone would visit Rick's parents at the Knotty Pine where they lived. Sometimes they would eat lunch at the Knotty Pine; sometimes they would be home. Some of the weekends, everyone would go hunting. If they stayed home, they would sit around the house. The children would play outside a lot, or come in and watch television. Typically, they would have supper at the green house. They would then watch television or the children would play outside some more. Occasionally, the children would go to a nearby recreation hall and park to play. Bedtime would be between 9 and 10 p.m.\n\nOn Sunday, Tutti would again fix breakfast and they would watch cartoons. Usually they would sit home and watch television, and the children would play outside. They went to the recreation hall a few times, although Tutti did not let them go too often. She would fix lunch at noon. There was no particular type of activity that took place on a typical Sunday afternoon, other than all of them being together and enjoying each other's company.\n\nThe children had rules of conduct and knew not to enter Rick and Tutti's room without knocking. Once Carol and Lisa knocked and Tutti, who was in her panties and bra, told them to come in. The girls \"liked to fell over themselves trying to get out,\" because they did not think they were supposed to be in the bedroom while she was dressing. Rick and Tutti had cable television, but the girls knew they were not supposed to watch anything with an R rating. Rick was strict about the boys not running around in underwear in front of the girls on the weekends that the boys would visit. The boys would have to put on their pajamas following their baths.\n\nDuring September 1982 through June 1983, Grace did not visit the green house very often. At no time did Grace come over and get undressed. During this time, Colleen visited frequently, especially on her way to work on weekdays. Sometimes Gina was with her. Gina was a friend of the family and visited the green house occasionally; her little girls may have visited, but her son never did. Gina never stayed more than an hour or took off her clothes.\n\nTutti first met Forsythe on Halloween 1982 at Colleen's. During the time in question, he came to the green house less than five times. He never stayed long, nor did he take his clothes off. Tutti could recall Dill and his family coming over on Easter and when Wayne Dill, Sr., was visiting. Other than that, sometimes he would come by and give Tutti a message from Grace. Easter and during their father's visit were the only times Tutti remembered him staying any length of time. Cliffy and Clovette would visit occasionally on weekends Rick was not working, and would bring their children to play. Sometimes they would come when Johnny, Tommy, and Brian were there, because it was the only time Bobo got to see the boys. Brandy also came. Christine rarely visited, because she spent weekends with her father. At no time was Cliffy or Clovette nude inside the green house.\n\nYvonne Mailloux was Tutti's friend. She would visit frequently and bring Angela with her. However, she never removed her clothes. (According to Angela, the only time she saw any of the children without their clothes was when she, Carol, and Lisa took baths. There was never a time in the girls' room when any of the children had their clothes off. Angela never saw any nude adults at the green house, or a board or handcuffs. She never saw a pistol or anyone sniff white powder.)\n\nVicki Pearce was another of Tutti's friends. She also visited frequently and brought her children, but they did not stay long.\n\nCarla Joyce was a friend of Colleen and the family. During the time in question, she and Colleen had a conflict for a while and Joyce was not\n\naround very often. Tutti could recall her being at the green house one time for approximately 20 minutes, when she and Colleen came over. Neither of them took their clothes off during this visit.\n\nBetween September 1982 and June 1983, Tutti had the boys every other weekend. On no occasion did Tutti have them two weekends in a row. One time Janice called her and said she wanted to keep Tommy at home because he was sick. Neither of the other boys visited that weekend. That did not change the alternate weekend schedule, so the boys were not with her the next weekend, either.\n\nDuring the time in question, deer hunting season was in September or October, and the family went hunting every weekend during the season. This involved them camping overnight. One weekend, they all went to the beach and stayed overnight. Another weekend, they took an all-day trip on a Saturday to the Los Angeles zoo.\n\nTutti denied that the children's testimony was true, and averred that she and Rick had a good relationship with all of them.\n\nRick\n\nRick also testified about hunting deer every weekend during the season. In addition, he testified to hunting other game during the various hunting seasons, and to Carol's, Lisa's, and Tutti's boys being along on many of the trips.\n\nAccording to Rick's testimony, he met Forsythe only once prior to his arrest. It was around the first week of August 1983, when Rick helped Cliffy move to Oklahoma. Before that, he had seen Forsythe a couple of times at the Knotty Pine. They said hello, since Rick knew Colleen, but Rick never saw Forsythe at the green house.\n\nRick saw Dill inside the green house probably three or four times. The only time Dill spent any considerable time there was on Easter Sunday. Most of the other times, he stayed less than half an hour. Grace was never in the green house when Rick was there, even on Easter. Tutti did not visit with her that much.\n\nRick denied participating in, or being present during, any molestations. He also denied having special lamps or photographic or video equipment. He never saw any of the defendants naked or having sex with children, nor did he do such things himself. He denied participating in the making of any\n\nchild pornography, or threatening any of the children with his pistol. There was never a sexual orgy at his house. The children's allegations were false.\n\nRick admitted smoking marijuana in front of Carol and Lisa, maybe a couple of times a week. He may have also smoked it in front of Angela P. a few times. He never smoked it in front of Tutti's boys, because they would tell Janice and their father. Tutti also smoked marijuana, but not in front of her boys. Rick and Tutti did not snort cocaine, nor did Rick ever see Tutti or Colleen snort white powder. He never saw anyone snort crank (methamphetamine).\n\nForsythe\n\nAccording to John Ebert, owner of The Appliance Doctor, Forsythe generally worked Monday through Friday, and more than 50 percent of the Saturdays, in 1982 and 1983. Most of the time, the shop closed at noon on Saturdays. Sometimes Forsythe would go to Ebert's residence on weekends and they would work on cars. Forsythe and Colleen were there quite a bit on weekends, sometimes even on Sundays. On May 21, 1983, which Rick testified was the date of Tommy's track meet, Forsythe was at the shop from between 8:30 and 9 a.m. until they closed that night between 5 and 6. There were periods during the day when Ebert was not at the shop -- he was gone at least three hours during the day -- but Forsythe was there when they closed.\n\nForsythe first met Colleen in August 1982, when he fixed her family's dryer in the course of his employment at The Appliance Doctor. Prior to that time, he knew Dill, but had not met Grace, Tutti, or Rick.\n\nShortly after meeting, Forsythe and Colleen began dating. They split up on Halloween night 1982 and did not see each other again until February 1983. In February, Forsythe moved into Colleen's apartment and lived there about two weeks. Also living there were Colleen, Clovette, Grace, Amanda, Windy, Christine, Bobo, and Brandy.\n\nAfter two weeks, Forsythe, together with his sister Hazel and Mike Warren, rented a place. Colleen moved in with them a few days later. Forsythe and Colleen remained there until July or August of 1983, when they moved into Clovette and Cliffy's residence as the two of them moved to Oklahoma. This was when Forsythe helped Rick load the truck. Forsythe frequently moved back to the shop (The Appliance Doctor) where he sometimes lived. There were about three or four times between February and August when he lived at the shop, because he and Colleen fought a lot. He would move out and live at the shop for about a week, then move back with\n\nher. In August 1983, he moved to Harbor City to work. Colleen did not move with him. Once he established a place to live, she visited occasionally, then moved in with him around October. They were married in Long Beach in November 1983.\n\nPrior to the time he began going with Colleen in 1982, Forsythe had never met Rick or Tutti, although he knew Dill and had met Gina and Grace. Nor had he visited the green house or met Tutti's boys or any of the other children who testified. After he began going with Colleen, he visited the green house maybe two times but did not stay more than an hour. The only time he remembered with any certainty, Rick was not home. The first time he remembered meeting the boys was when Tutti visited at his and Colleen's residence and had the boys with her. Most of the time, he and Colleen visited Cliffy and Clovette and the boys would be there playing. This was in August 1983.\n\nForsythe denied that any of the alleged child abuse or molestation occurred. He denied ever touching a child in his life, or entering into any kind of conspiracy with the other defendants. He never committed, aided or encouraged, or saw the acts to which the children testified. He denied having any experience with the use of videotape equipment or a video cassette recorder. He operated a video camera once in high school.\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e16\u003c/span\u003e\n\nForsythe admitted using crank occasionally during the latter part of 1982 and beginning of 1983. Sometimes he would use a straw to snort it. During this period of time, he saw Colleen snort crank perhaps one time. At no time were any of the children, even Windy or Amanda, around. Forsythe never used drugs at the green house.\n\nForsythe admitted prior felony convictions for second degree robbery and receiving or possessing stolen property.\n\nColleen\n\nBy using her diaries, Colleen attempted to reconstruct her whereabouts during the period of time in question. During September 1982, she had no\n\nweekend dates with Forsythe. Nor was Amanda living with her, because Allen B. had run off with the child. During this time, Windy was almost always with Grace. Colleen got Amanda back October 8, 1982.\n\nDuring October and November 1982, Colleen was involved with Allen B., although she and Forsythe were together most of the time during the last two weeks of October. Colleen and Allen remained together until Wednesday, December 8, when Allen went to jail. On December 14, Colleen began spending time with Randy Robertson. Colleen ran into Forsythe on December 28, which was the first time she had seen him in a couple of months. She wrote in her diary that she was not giving up Randy.\n\nColleen continued to be involved with Randy during January 1983, but on January 23, she spent the night with Forsythe. In early February, Colleen was seeing Randy. Her diary entry for Saturday, February 12, indicated that Allen was in jail and she could not find Amanda. Colleen was with Forsythe from February 10 through at least February 13. During the rest of the month, she vacillated between Forsythe and Randy.\n\nOn Saturday, February 19, Colleen moved in with Forsythe. She did not have Amanda back yet, and Windy stayed with Grace. Colleen finally got Amanda back, after which the child alternated between staying with her and Grace. On February 28, Colleen took the children to the pediatric clinic at Kern Medical Center, as Amanda had a severe ear infection and Windy had fever blisters. Colleen asked that they both be given complete physicals, which she expected would entail an examination of the girls' whole bodies.\n\nOn March 21, Colleen moved out of Forsythe's residence but continued to see him. During the latter part of March, she was also seeing Randy at times. The situation continued through most of April, and on April 18, Forsythe started moving his stuff into Colleen's residence. He moved out again on June 20, but he and Colleen continued to see each other. Colleen spent the night of Saturday, June 25, with Randy, and the next night with Forsythe.\n\nOn August 9, 1983, Tutti, Cliffy, and Clovette moved to Oklahoma, and Colleen moved into the house Cliffy and Clovette vacated. Grace, Windy, Amanda, and Forsythe moved in with her. On September 5, Forsythe moved to Los Angeles. Colleen visited him on many weekends and moved in with him on October 1. Windy and Amanda were not with her.\n\nColleen spent about 30 days with Forsythe in Los Angeles, over different time spans. She would move in and move out. In the latter part of October, she returned to Bakersfield. Her October 12 diary entry indicated that she\n\nand Forsythe broke up but she was going to remain in Los Angeles until Friday. On November 4, 1983, they got married. On November 12, Colleen moved back to Grace's in Bakersfield. On November 15, Windy went to Oklahoma with Tutti and Rick. Windy was going to live with Cliffy and Clovette because Colleen could not control her. Windy hated Forsythe and did not like Colleen.\n\nDuring 1984, Colleen lived with Forsythe off and on. She lived most of the time prior to her arrest with Grace and Amanda. Windy phoned and said she wanted to come home, so Rick and Tutti brought her when they came to California for the custody hearing. Windy then stayed with Colleen until Colleen's June 4 arrest.\n\nBetween September 1982 and June 1983, Colleen frequently visited the green house. She tried not to visit when Rick was home because she did not like being around him. Sometimes she would have coffee with Tutti before work; sometimes Tutti would ask for a ride to get the boys or take them home; sometimes Colleen would just go to visit. A couple of times a week, Colleen would go over there to smoke a joint. Colleen also admitted using cocaine, angel dust, crank, and acid during the time period in question. She denied being a heavy user and testified that every time she used crank, her diary contained a reference to it.\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e17\u003c/span\u003e\n\nWhen Colleen first began living with Forsythe, Forsythe and Rick did not know each other, nor did Colleen and Forsythe go to the green house during that time. Even after the two men met, they did not became friends or start doing things together. Grace did not have a good relationship with Forsythe; they spoke only if they had to.\n\nColleen, Forsythe, Windy, and Amanda lived together on various weekends when Colleen could not recall if they went to the green house. She denied any knowledge of there being pornographic pictures involving her children, Tutti's boys, or Clovette's children; however, she admitted she did not know what went on at the green house when she was not there. She never snorted white powder in front of Amanda, Windy, Johnny, Brian, Tommy, or Christine. She never saw Forsythe or anyone else do it in front of Amanda. Colleen never saw Tutti use crank. At no time did Colleen go to the green house and engage in sexual activity with children, nor did she see anyone engage in such activity with them.\n\nBonnie B., Allen's wife, confirmed that during 1982 and 1983, there were times when she and Allen had both Amanda and Windy, as well as other\n\ntimes when they had Amanda by herself. At one point, Bonnie had Amanda from December 28, 1982, until the weekend after January 15, 1983. During this time, Bonnie and Allen left Amanda with Jerry and Jenise Stevenson in Bakersfield. Bonnie had Amanda and Windy both every weekend during December 1982 and until about January 23, 1983. According to Jenise Stevenson, she kept Amanda the last week of January 1983 and the first couple weeks of February.\n\nIn February 1985, Dr. Jess Diamond, a physician at Kern Medical Center, performed a complete physical on Windy, who was brought in complaining of painful urination. Dr. Diamond viewed the rectal area, but made no note as to whether he actually placed a finger within the rectum. Other than noting that Windy had poor hygiene of the rectal area, he did not take note of anything else. He did not note any injuries, scars, or tears. He did not check the sphincter tone or elasticity. He noted nothing abnormal. There was no irritation in the area of the clitoris. Windy's urinary opening showed a small amount of discharge. The hymen was intact and it covered most of the introitus, which is the opening into the vaginal area. However, it seemed to have a double (bifid) appearance. It raised a question as to whether this was a congenital bifid vagina, or a septal hymen. Diamond could not tell from looking, although the hymen appeared intact and he did not see any tears in it. The labia minora was normal; there was no evidence of any problem, and Diamond saw nothing unusual about the fourchette. He saw no scars, transections, or tags. Diamond diagnosed a urinary tract infection and recommended a referral to the genito urinary clinic to resolve the question about the bifid vagina and whether there were any congenital defects in the kidney system. He did not perform a vaginal examination because he did not have written approval from Windy's parents. Lab tests had been previously performed. There was a positive test report for gardnarella. Gardnarella vaginalis is an organism that is found in sexually active individuals. It is sexually transmitted. There was no way to tell how long Windy had had it.\n\nDr. Diamond did not see Windy in order to determine if she had been sexually assaulted. In examining her, he did not use the normal methodology he would have used to make such a determination. In his examination, however, which included an examination of the fourchette, he found no signs of molestation.\n\nDr. Diamond has examined thousands of children who have complained of being vaginally molested. A lay person has the concept that in such cases, a torn vagina will be present. This is not true. In fact, a torn hymen is found in only about 1 percent of children who have a history of vaginal molestation. This is because, in order to tear the hymen, the penis has to be inserted\n\nthrough the hymen into the vagina. If a child has a penis shoved between her legs, the pubococcygeous muscle will subconsciously contract, making penetration difficult. In such instances, penetration would take an extreme amount of force.\n\nIn children, vaginal penetration means in the genital area, not, as in the adult, insertion of a penis through the hymen into the vagina. Most children who describe a penis being placed in them mean the penis was placed in the area of the vulva. This is the area before the hymen that is called the vulvar vestibule. A child's statement of penetration usually means the penis was up against or in the area of the vulvar vestibule on the outside of the hymen. There may be no signs whatsoever, or there may be some irritation or scarring on the fourchette. Nor can a child determine the depth of penetration.\n\nGrace\n\nBetween September 1982 and June 1983, Grace saw Tutti's boys only a very few times. Occasionally, Tutti would bring them by the house to say hello, but they never stayed long. She did not see the boys at the green house at any time. During this time, Grace had no relationship with Rick. She spoke to him, but did not know him.\n\nGrace was at the green house two or three times prior to her arrest. The first time she could recall going there was in December 1982, when Wayne Dill, Sr., was visiting. She stayed a few minutes, then they all went out to eat. The next time, she went to see Tutti for some reason. She did not stay very long. She may have also gone there on another occasion, although she could not recall with any certainty if or when that was. During this time she saw Rick's girls two or three times. Grace did not see Tutti very often and saw Rick only a few times. Grace never liked Forsythe and had no real relationship with him. Dill did not live with Grace during the time in question, nor did she see him often. He did not visit her every other weekend, although he might have been there two weekends in a row. Dill never took her to the green house, although she sometimes gave him messages to deliver, such as asking Tutti to call or come by.\n\nDuring the time in question, Grace played bingo frequently. Different people gave her rides. She played on weekends sometimes, although she could not remember any specific dates or how many weekends. During this time, she also went to Las Vegas twice on weekends. Both times were 24-hour turn-around trips, where a group of people left Saturday morning at 7 a.m. and returned on Sunday. Grace also went to Galt, probably in March 1983. She stayed five or six days and returned Sunday afternoon. She also\n\nwent to the coast sometime during warm weather in 1983. Grace could not remember if she was gone on this trip over a weekend.\n\nDuring this period, Grace saw Milan Maloney several times. They would go fishing and camping and have barbecues. During the first part of 1983, they did not see each other as often as usual. This was not unusual in their relationship; they would have a big fight over the kids, then go their separate ways for a couple of weeks. They would talk on the phone, but Maloney would stay away because he did not get along with Grace's children. He would want to go out of town or somewhere and Grace would not be able to go because she was baby-sitting. On one weekend during the time in question, Grace and Maloney went camping to Lake Isabella. They also went fishing together several times.\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e18\u003c/span\u003e\n\nGrace never touched children in a sexual way, nor was she present when others touched children sexually. No child ever touched her in a sexual way, nor was she ever present when children touched adults sexually. She never saw anyone film nasty pictures of children. The children's allegations about her involvement were not true.\n\nGrace worked on Easter 1983, and on May 21, 1983. Grace's personnel records from San Joaquin Hospital showed that she was off work many weekends during the time in question. However, in April 1983, she worked every Saturday and Sunday from 7 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. Yvonne Schneider, a cardiovascular technician at the hospital, transported Grace to and from work whenever they both worked the shift that got off at 3:30 p.m. On those days, Schneider dropped Grace off at home between 3:45 and 4 p.m. She never took Grace to the green house.\n\nGina\n\nGina did not testify at trial.\n\nGina lived at 622 Edmond, Oildale, with her father, John H. Miller, off and on for 14 years. During the summer of 1983, Carla Joyce, who is around Gina's age, lived across the street in front of Miller. Gina never went by the name of Carla, nor had Miller ever heard anyone call her that. People told Miller they saw Joyce driving Gina's car.\n\nAt some point, Gina moved out of the Miller house for six to eight months, although Miller could not say when this occurred. Even when she\n\nwas living at the family residence, Gina would sometimes leave on the weekend and Miller would not know where she was. She would not be gone the entire weekend, but might be gone all day Saturday.\n\nMiller never saw any pornography around his house, nor, to his knowledge, were any such items seized during the search of his house. During that search, the sheriff's department tore the house \"all to pieces.\"\n\nAdditional facts will be presented in this opinion where pertinent to the discussion of specific issues.\n\nI.\n\nProsecutorial and Trial Court Misconduct\n\nDefendants allege numerous instances of prosecutorial misconduct, which they contend denied them the right to a fair trial. Related to this point are claims of trial court misconduct and allegedly biased evidentiary rulings. We conclude that because of gross prosecutorial misconduct, defendants did not receive a fair trial. Accordingly, their convictions must be reversed.\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e19\u003c/span\u003e\n\nWe first discuss the general law regarding prosecutorial misconduct. We then discuss the various types of misconduct which occurred in this case and give illustrative examples of each.\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e20\u003c/span\u003e Except for the section titled \"Misconduct Outside Jury's Presence,\" all examples occurred in the jury's presence unless otherwise stated. Trial court inaction/misconduct is presented in a separate category.\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e21\u003c/span\u003e\n\nA. General Law\n\n\"'Prosecutorial misconduct implies the use of deceptive or reprehensible methods to attempt to persuade either the court or the jury. [Citation.]'\" (People v. Haskett (1982) 30 Cal. 3d 841, 866 [180 Cal. Rptr. 640,640 P.2d 776].) A prosecutor has a duty to prosecute vigorously. \"But, while he may strike hard blows, he is not at liberty to strike foul ones. It is as much his duty to refrain from improper methods calculated to produce a wrongful conviction as it is to use every legitimate means to bring about a just one.\" (Berger v. United States (1935) 295 U.S. 78, 88 [79 L.Ed. 1314, 1321,55 S.Ct. 629].) Misconduct need not be intentional in order to constitute reversible error. (People v. Bolton (1979) 23 Cal. 3d 208, 214 [152 Cal. Rptr. 141, 589 P.2d 396].)\n\nIn viewing what occurred at the instant trial, the admonition given by the court in People v. Lee Chuck (1889) 78 Cal. 317, 329 [20 P. 719], and repeated in People v. McCracken (1952) 39 Cal. 2d 336, 349 [246 P.2d 913], is especially apt: \"'[Prosecuting officers] seem to forget that it is their sworn duty to see that the defendant has a fair and impartial trial, and that he be not convicted except by competent and legitimate evidence. Equally with the court, the district attorney, as the representative of law and justice, should be fair and impartial. He should remember that it is not his sole duty to convict, and that to use his official position to obtain a verdict by illegitimate and unfair means is to bring his office and courts into distrust. We make due allowance for the zeal which is the natural result of such a legal battle as this, and for the desire of every lawyer to win his case, but these should be overcome by the conscientious desire of a sworn officer of the court to do his duty, and not go beyond it.'\"\n\nRespondent first argues that much of the alleged misconduct is not cognizable on appeal for want of objection in the trial court. \"[T]he initial question to be decided in all cases in which a defendant complains of prosecutorial misconduct for the first time on appeal is whether a timely objection and admonition would have cured the harm. If it would, the contention must be rejected [citation]; if it would not, the court must then and only then reach the issue whether on the whole record the harm resulted in a miscarriage of justice within the meaning of the Constitution.\" (People v. Green (1980) 27 Cal. 3d 1, 34 [164 Cal. Rptr. 1, 609 P.2d 468].)\n\nGenerally, in order to raise the alleged misconduct on appeal, the objection must be both timely and specific. (People v. Simon (1989) 208 Cal. App. 3d 841, 849 [256 Cal. Rptr. 373].) Moreover, where defense counsel objects during trial but does not request an appropriate instruction or admonition in order to lessen the possible prejudicial effect on the jury, the\n\nasserted objection is waived for purposes of appeal. (People v. Ghent (1987) 43 Cal. 3d 739, 762 [239 Cal. Rptr. 82, 739 P.2d 1250], cert. den. 485 U.S. 929 [99 L.Ed.2d 261, 108 S.Ct. 1099].) \"Simply to object or make an assignment of misconduct without seeking a curative admonition is generally not enough. [Citation.] 'The reason for this rule, of course, is that \"the trial court should be given an opportunity to correct the abuse and thus, if possible, prevent by suitable instructions the harmful effect upon the minds of the jury.\"' [Citation.]\" (People v. Bonin (1988) 46 Cal. 3d 659, 689 [250 Cal. Rptr. 687, 758 P.2d 1217], cert. den. 489 U.S. 1091 [103 L.Ed.2d 864, 109 S.Ct. 1561].)\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e22\u003c/span\u003e\n\nThe rule that a defendant must object and request an admonition at trial in order to preserve the issue for appeal, however, \"applies only if a timely objection or request for admonition would have cured the harm.\" Accordingly, the rule is not applicable where any objection by defense counsel would almost certainly have been overruled. (People v. Hamilton (1989) 48 Cal. 3d 1142, 1184, fn. 27 [259 Cal. Rptr. 701, 774 P.2d 730].) Likewise, where such an objection is overruled, failure to request an admonition is excused because there is no opportunity to do so. (People v. Green, supra, 27 Cal. 3d at p. 35, fn. 19.) Such was the situation in the instant case: early on in trial, it became abundantly clear that any objections by defense counsel on the grounds of prosecutorial misconduct would be overruled and requests for admonitions denied or ignored.\n\nA jury will generally be presumed to have followed an admonition to disregard improper evidence or comments, as \"[i]t is only in the exceptional case that 'the improper subject matter is of such a character that its effect . . . cannot be removed by the court's admonitions.' [Citation.]\" (People v. Allen (1978) 77 Cal. App. 3d 924, 934-935 [144 Cal. Rptr. 6].) However, in some situations an admonition will actually exacerbate the prejudice to the defendant. (People v. Bolton, supra, 23 Cal. 3d at pp. 215-216, fn. 5.) Thus, where improper comments and assertions are interspersed throughout trial and/or closing argument, repeated objections might well serve to impress upon the jury the damaging force of the misconduct. (People v. Kirkes (1952) 39 Cal. 2d 719, 726 [249 P.2d 1].) In such a situation, a series of admonitions will not generally cure the harmful effect of such misconduct. (Ibid.)\n\nAdditionally, a lack of contemporaneous objection is excused where the prosecutor asks questions and defense counsel assumes that he is\n\nprepared to present evidence on the issue. (People v. Lo Cigno (1961) 193 Cal. App. 2d 360, 371 [14 Cal. Rptr. 354].) Lack of objection is also excused, as being futile, where the district attorney's conduct has been sanctioned by the trial court's erroneous evidentiary ruling. (People v. Rios (1985) 163 Cal. App. 3d 852, 868 [210 Cal. Rptr. 271].)\n\nBoth of these situations occurred frequently in the instant case. Furthermore, defendants urge that we consider an objection made by one as an objection made by all. This is reasonable, since once one defendant's objection was overruled, it was futile for any other defendant to raise the same objection. Moreover, we may consider the issue on its merits despite a lack of objection, in order to forestall a possible claim of ineffectiveness of counsel based on failure to object. (See People v. Lewis (1990) 50 Cal. 3d 262, 282-283 [266 Cal. Rptr. 834, 786 P.2d 892].)\n\nRespondent also notes that numerous instances raised by defendants occurred outside the presence of the jury. Respondent correctly points out that \"[r]eversal of judgment is designed not so much to punish prosecutors as to protect the fair trial rights of defendants\" (People v. Bolton, supra, 23 Cal. 3d at p. 214), and concludes that therefore no sanctions should be imposed for anything that did not occur in the presence of the jury.\n\nThe foregoing principle does not grant a prosecutor carte blanche just because the jury is not present. (See People v. Kelley (1977) 75 Cal. App. 3d 672 [142 Cal. Rptr. 457] [reviewing court considered misconduct occurring in and out of jury's presence and assessed prejudicial effect thereof].) Accordingly, in the instant case this court will not turn a blind eye to misconduct which occurred outside the jury's presence, although that aspect affects the prejudice analysis.\n\nRespondent asserts that in any event, very little misconduct occurred, and what little there was did not prejudice defendants. Generally, \"[p]rosecutorial misconduct is cause for reversal only when it is 'reasonably probable that a result more favorable to the defendant would have occurred had the district attorney refrained from the comment attacked by the defendant.' [Citation.]\" (People v. Milner (1988) 45 Cal. 3d 227, 245 [246 Cal. Rptr. 713,753 P.2d 669]; People v. Bolton, supra,23 Cal. 3d at p. 214; People v. Beivelman (1968) 70 Cal. 2d 60, 75 [73 Cal. Rptr. 521, 447 P.2d 913], cert. den. 406 U.S. 971 [32 L.Ed.2d 671, 92 S.Ct. 2415], overruled on other grounds in People v. Green, supra, 27 Cal. 3d 1, 33-34.) \"Short of misconduct of that nature which infringes on a specific guaranty of the Bill of Rights, . . . prosecutorial misconduct implicates the defendant's federal constitutional rights only if it is so egregious that it infects the trial with such unfairness as to make the conviction a denial of due process.\" (People\n\nv. Harris (1989) 47 Cal. 3d 1047, 1083-1084 [255 Cal. Rptr. 352, 767 P.2d 619].)\n\nRespondent contends that the evidence of guilt was overwhelming and the jury must have discounted the bickering by counsel as inconsequential to the case before it. Occasional bickering, especially in a short trial, might be discounted and ignored. Here, however, it was constant, over the course of a lengthy trial. Given the nature of the exchanges among the attorneys, and between defense counsel and the bench, it is unlikely that it had little effect on the jurors. Moreover, there are other types of misconduct with which to contend. Additionally, the sheer volume of questionable evidentiary rulings, most of which benefited the prosecution, casts substantial doubt on the validity of the argument that the strength of the People's evidence overcame the effect of any misconduct. For reasons which will appear, we conclude the misconduct was prejudicial under any standard.\n\nB. Misconduct During Closing Argument\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e23\u003c/span\u003e\n\nA prosecutor's closing argument is an especially critical period of trial. (People v. Alverson (1964) 60 Cal. 2d 803, 805 [36 Cal. Rptr. 479, 388 P.2d 711].) Since it comes from an official representative of the People, it carries great weight and must therefore be reasonably objective. (People v. Talle (1952)111 Cal. App. 2d 650, 677 [245 P.2d 633].) An argument by the prosecution that appeals to the passion or prejudice of the jury is improper. (People v. Haskett, supra, 30 Cal. 3d at p. 863; People v. Talle, supra, 111 Cal. App. 2d at p. 676.)\n\nPerhaps the most egregious single act of misconduct occurred following Gindes's argument that, although it would be an atrocity to convict an innocent person, the People had proven their case as required by law and to set the defendants free would be a similar travesty. He then stated:\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e24\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\"Another Thing. I Want You to Understand This, and I Want You to Consider It Very Carefully. This Is Important. After the Judge Instructs You and You Go Into the Jury Room and You Start Your Deliberations, You Might Be Thinking When You Hear an Argument You Might Be Thinking in Your Mind, Why Is He Arguing This? I Know This. Why Is He Talking About This Point? I Know It. I Know About It.\n\n\"But You 12 Are Going to Go Back Into a Jury Room and Decide the Issues of This Case. And There Is Going to Be a Little Difference Between the Way You Decide These Issues as Far as the Prosecution Is Concerned and as Far as the Defense Is Concerned. And I Want to Tell You That Difference. They Need One Vote. One. That Is It. They Need One Vote to Block a Conviction. If We Fail to Persuade All 12 of You Beyond a Reasonable Doubt, We Persuade 11 of You It Wipes Out Six Months, Folks. It's as Though It Never Existed.\n\n\"Mr. Eyherabide: I Will Object. Improper Argument.\n\n\"The Court: Overruled.\n\n\"Mr. Gindes: One Vote for Them and We Go Back to Square One. It Takes 12 Votes for the Prosecution. You Must Unanimously Agree on Any Verdict. So I Want You to Think About That . . . .\"\n\nThe trial court overruled objections, stating, \"All you need [is] unanimity for a verdict either way. That's the impression I got.\" It subsequently denied a motion for mistrial based on this and other portions of closing argument.\n\nDefendants analogize these remarks to situations in which deadlocked juries were told the case would be retried if they could not reach a verdict. In People v. Barraza (1979) 23 Cal. 3d 675 [153 Cal. Rptr. 459, 591 P.2d 947], such an instruction was held to be error under the principles laid down in People v. Gainer (1977) 19 Cal. 3d 835 [139 Cal. Rptr. 861, 566 P.2d 997, 97 A.L.R.3d 73]. The Barraza court stated: \"The pervasive influence of such misinformation [that the case must be decided sooner or later] is further compounded when, as here, the jury charge refers to the expense involved in trying a case . . . . [R]eference to the expense and inconvenience of a retrial is irrelevant to the issue of a defendant's guilt or innocence and is thus impermissible. [Citation.] That the reference here did not link the notion of expense to a prospective retrial is immaterial, for the link is obvious and will naturally be inferred by the jurors once the subject is introduced. It is not so much the irrelevance of such a reference that is troubling, however, as the additional pressure to decide thus created. Consideration of expense 'may have an incalculably coercive effect on jurors reasonably concerned about the spiraling costs of government.' [Citation.] The improper reference to expense herein thus augments the substantial, if subtle, pressure created by the improper instructions concerning the need for retrial. Although these erroneous instructions may not constitute a\n\ndirect admonition to the minority, they have for all practical purposes much the same effect . . . .\" (People v. Barraza, supra, 23 Cal. 3d at p. 685.)\n\nRespondent distinguishes the instant situation from that confronted in Barraza and Gainer and contends that the remark was not prejudicial because it came during argument, and the jury was instructed that statements made by attorneys are not evidence. (See CALJIC No. 1.02 (4th ed. 1979).)\n\nIt is proper for a prosecutor to urge jurors to do their best to reach a verdict, even though such urging may contain a passing reference to retrial. (People v. Johnson (1989) 47 Cal. 3d 1194, 1241-1242 [255 Cal. Rptr. 569, 767 P.2d 1047].) However, it is improper to appeal to the self-interest of jurors or to urge them to view the case from a personal point of view. (People ex rel. Dept. of Public Works v. Graziadio (1964) 231 Cal. App. 2d 525, 533-534 [42 Cal. Rptr. 29].)\n\nConsidered in context of the instant case, we view Gindes's remarks as going far beyond proper bounds and as being worse than the instruction condemned in Barraza. These jurors had given half a year out of their lives to try this case. Gindes essentially told them not merely that a verdict had to be unanimous, as the trial court interpreted the remarks, but that if a single one of them did not vote with the others for convictions, all of their time and effort over those six months would be completely wasted. Although these remarks came before the start of deliberations, they still exerted a powerful pressure to decide the case -- to convict -- that was much more personal and therefore potentially more coercive than any reference to the cost to taxpayers or the like. Because of the personal aspect of the pressure, respondent's distinction between argument and instruction is unpersuasive. It is true the court did not tell the jurors anything along these lines, and it instructed that counsel's statements were not evidence. But in this situation, counsel's statements did not have to be evidence to be incalculably damaging to defendants, nor did they have to come from the court. The idea was planted in the jurors' minds that anyone not voting for conviction would be nullifying a great deal of hard work and rendering vain the personal sacrifice of all.\n\nDefendants also vigorously contend that portions of Gindes's closing argument were pure appeals to the passions of the jurors. One instance occurred during Gindes's response to Sims's argument about whether Grace, a grandmother, would reasonably be expected to do the acts of which she was accused:\n\n\"You know, I don't think that the defendants' actions are as historically unique and atrocious as they might seem before you. You know, we tend\n\nto isolate ourselves in a jury trial and look at history like sort of tunnel vision. But, you know, I appeal to you to think back over the history of civilization. It's been replete with atrocities. Some of you are old enough to remember what happened during World War II and Korean [War] before [ sic ] then. The world, you know, unfortunately has always had things happen that shock [the] conscience of people. And we can look way, way back, I think, in history and maybe get a grasp of something you saw in this case.\n\n\"And what I want to refer to is a message that was given many, many years ago shortly after Christ was crucified to the people of Gallatia [ sic ] by Paul. And it's found in the New Testament in the Book of Gallatians [ sic ] and put in more modern language in the form of the Jerusalem [B]ible. The message was this: He said to the people of Gallatia [ sic ], 'Let me put it like this, if you are guided by the spirit, you will be in no danger of self-indulgence. Since self-indulgence is the opposite of the spirit, the spirit is totally against such a thing, and it's precisely because the two are so opposed that you do not always carry out your good intentions.' He continued, Paul did, 'If you are led by the spirit, no law can touch you. When self-indulgence is at work, the results are obvious. Fornication, gross indecency, sexual irresponsibility, feuds, rankling, jealousy, bad temper, quarrels, disagreements, factions, envy, drunkenness, orgies and similar things.' And Paul said, 'I warn you now as I warned you before those who behave like this will not inherit the kingdom of God.'\n\n\"Mr. Fusilier: I'm going to object to this kind of argument.\n\n\"The Court: Grounds?\n\n\"Mr. Fusilier: Grounds interjecting, I think, it's interjecting religion into a law case.\n\n\"The Court: Overruled.\n\n\"Mr. Fusilier: It's not proper.\n\n\"The Court: Overruled.\n\n\"Mr. Gindes: This [ sic ] people are, as Paul say [ sic ] them many years ago, gluttons. Gluttons for self-indulgence. They have shown that by all of their conduct. They have abandoned the spirit and have gluttonized their body. Lies, liquors, 'getting shit-faced', cranking up, taking Coca-cola, taking drugs, taking crank, taking dust,\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e25\u003c/span\u003e the orgies, the arguments, the feuds\n\nbetween them. This is no new unique thing. It might seem strange to you because we're before a tribunal of justice, but this gluttony, this appetite of these defendants is what charges through, and that's what answers Mr. Rubin's question, did these people do this to arouse themselves as Grace Dill said in the jail, 'You betcha.'\"\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e26\u003c/span\u003e\n\nAnother instance occurred at the very end of closing argument:\n\n\"I Submit That It's Now Time to Do Something. That Is This: I Want You to Look at All the Evidence Presented in This Case and I Want You to Weigh It, All the Evidence, and Consider It All as a Whole and Consider It in Light of the Instructions That the Court Is Going to Give You, and Determine Which of These Two Pictures That Mr. Vendrasco Talked About Was the Truth. Those of Six Children, Christine, B.J., Windy, Johnny, Tommy, Amanda. Are They All Lying? Or Are They Telling the Truth?

Thank You Very Much for Your Patience.\n\n\"The Court: Thank You, Mr. Gindes.\"\n\nThe trial court denied a subsequent motion for mistrial on the ground that there was \"no undue emotional appeal in the argument of any counsel.\"\n\nRespondent contends that there was nothing improper about the foregoing argument, since Gindes was merely arguing the evidence presented at trial and showing the jury that these atrocious crimes were not so unique as to be unbelievable. We agree that Gindes's reference to the crimes as atrocities did not constitute misconduct. The use of epithets is proper where warranted by the evidence. (People v. Adcox (1988) 47 Cal. 3d 207, 237 [253 Cal. Rptr. 55,763 P.2d 906].) Moreover, Gindes was entitled to argue that such crimes were not so unique historically as to be unbelievable. Although his linking of \"atrocities\" with World War II may call to mind Hitler's \"Final Solution,\" the reference was mild and only arguably misconduct.\n\nThe real problem arises with Gindes's choice of biblical passages. There is nothing wrong, per se, with quoting from the Bible in final argument, or with arguing that such conduct occurred even in biblical times. (See People v. Williams (1988) 45 Cal. 3d 1268, 1325 [248 Cal. Rptr. 834, 756 P.2d 221], cert. den. U.S. [102 L.Ed.2d 1006, 109 S.Ct. 883].) But Gindes took matters a step further and noted Paul's statement that people who behave like this will not inherit the kingdom of God. Such argument is inappropriate. (Cf. People v. Poggi (1988) 45 Cal. 3d 306, 340[246 Cal. Rptr. 886, 753 P.2d 1082][prosecutor's references to trial in which higher authority would judge, victim would testify as she was before the killing, and defendant would be sentenced to eternal damnation and hell inappropriate but not prejudicial; remarks came at the very close of argument and were recognizable as hyperbole and therefore discounted].)\n\nThe problem was compounded when Gindes basically turned Christ into an unsworn witness for the children's credibility. Gindes essentially told the jurors, Christ took the side of children over adults, Christ said they were innocent, therefore you the jurors should think so, too, and should believe the children in this case.\n\nThis is not to say the entire argument was impermissible. For example, calling each child a victim and each defendant a child molester was proper since Gindes was merely arguing his interpretation of what the evidence showed. As the California Supreme Court stated in People v. Beivelman,\n\nsupra, 70 Cal. 2d at pages 76-77: \"'\"It is the province of a district attorney to state to a jury the various conclusions that he draws from the evidence, and to make it clear to the jury what conclusions in his opinion should be drawn from the evidence introduced, so long as he keeps within the scope of conclusions which may properly be drawn.\" [Citation.] \"The right of counsel to discuss the merits of a case, both as to the law and facts, is very wide, and he has the right to state fully his views as to what the evidence shows, and as to the conclusions to be fairly drawn therefrom. The adverse party cannot complain if the reasoning be faulty and the deductions illogical, as such matters are ultimately for the consideration of the jury.\" [Citation.] In the argument before the jury, any reasonable inference may be drawn from the evidence . . . .' [Citation.]\"\n\nThe overall tone of the argument, however, was purely an attempt to play upon the passions and prejudices of the jurors. For instance, Gindes equated a not guilty verdict with forgiving defendants for their crimes. The two are simply not the same legally. Moreover, coming close on the heels of Gindes's references to Christ and who will or will not inherit the kingdom of God, the remarks presented a subtle argument that jurors voting not guilty would be at odds with Christ and would be condoning the type of behavior the Bible condemns. This is not proper argument. Nor is placing upon the jurors the responsibility for the children's lives. (See fn. 27.) Whether or not this portion of the argument can be construed as a subtle statement by Gindes of his belief in defendants' guilt,\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e27\u003c/span\u003e it clearly is an appeal to the passions of the jurors.\n\nUnlike the situation in People v. Poggi, supra, 45 Cal. 3d at page 340, such appeals to the passions and prejudices of the jurors were not brief, but were interspersed throughout the prosecutor's closing argument. As such, we cannot conclude that they were recognizable as mere hyperbole and so were probably discounted by the jurors.\n\nReferences were also made during closing argument to facts not in evidence. Argument is improper when it is neither based on the evidence nor related to a matter of common knowledge. (People v. Bell (1989) 49 Cal. 3d 502, 539 [262 Cal. Rptr. 1, 778 P.2d 129]; People v. Heishman (1988) 45 Cal. 3d 147, 195-196 [246 Cal. Rptr. 673, 753 P.2d 629]; People v. Fosselman (1983) 33 Cal. 3d 572, 579-581 [189 Cal. Rptr. 855, 659 P.2d 1144];\n\nPeople v. Kirkes, supra, 39 Cal. 2d at p. 724; People v. Evans (1952) 39 Cal. 2d 242, 251 [246 P.2d 636].)\n\nA clear example occurred during Gindes's argument about why the children waited so long before they told anyone what was happening. Gindes stated:\n\n\"So That Is Something That Maybe Is Not Common Experience, It's a Myth. It's Another Myth. You Hear About It All the Time in the News as Matters of Historical Facts, Folks. There Is a Whole History of That. And When They Do Tell, Remember That Little Girl, She Was Molested Over and Over Again by Her Uncle and She Did Tell and She Went to Court and the Judge Said, You Should Have Told About This a Long Time Ago. How Can I Believe You? It Took You a Year to Tell. If This Really Would Have Happened, Why Didn't You Tell?\n\n\"She Is a United States Senator From Florida Right Now. She Didn't Tell for a Long Time. When She Told She Was Disbelieved. It's Just Another Atrocity, Another Example of False Expectations of People. So What Do We Do, We Say to Ourselves? What Do We Say to Ourselves When We Look at These Children Who Testified in Front of You? They Should Have Told Right Away? They Should Have Told a Teacher? How Many Teachers Do We Have on This Jury Panel? How Many Teachers Did I Ask, Did You Hear Me Ask, Have You Ever Had a Kid Complain About Being, a Child, Being Molested to You? I Think of All the Teachers, of All the Students, of the Thousands of Students, I Think, You Know, We Heard Jurors Talk About One or Two Incidences. It's Not Something That You Tell Your Teacher. It's Not Something You Volunteer to a Teacher. My Mom's Making Me Lick Her Vagina. That Is Not Something You Tell a Teacher.\"\n\nA short time later, he continued in the same vein:\n\n\"Well, Another Thing Mr. Eyherabide Talked About or His Questions Seemed to Imply Is That Teachers, If Molestation Is Occurring, Should Find Out About It. Should Know About It. Should Be Told About It by Their Students. Right. And I Think That the Question That We Have Here Is Basically, First of All, You Saw a Lot of Teachers Testify Before You. I Mean -- excuse Me, a Lot of Teachers During Jury Selection, You Heard\n\nHow Many of Them Had Actually Had Kids Come Up and Discuss With Them That They Were Victims of Child Abuse.\"\n\nCounsel may argue to the jury matters which are not in evidence, but which are common knowledge or illustrations drawn from common experience, history, or literature. (People v. Sassounian (1986) 182 Cal. App. 3d 361, 396 [226 Cal. Rptr. 880], cert. den. 481 U.S. 1039 [95 L.Ed.2d 817, 107 S.Ct. 1977].) We question whether the story about the senator from Florida, albeit factually based, falls within the foregoing principle. Additionally, Gindes's questioning of teachers about molestations reported by students, occurred during voir dire, not the evidentiary portion of trial. Some of the jurors may not have been privy to it, depending on what panel was being questioned. Regardless, the prospective jurors' answers were not \"evidence\" as that term is defined by statute,\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e28\u003c/span\u003e such as could properly be argued against defendants.\n\nDefendants also complain of the denigration of defense counsel. While a prosecutor may properly sympathetically portray a victim, he may not include defense counsel as a villain who was attacking the victim. (People v. Turner (1983) 145 Cal. App. 3d 658, 673-674 [193 Cal. Rptr. 614].) By so doing, he casts aspersions on the defendant's right to defend himself and to be represented by counsel. (Id. at p. 674.) Moreover, such misconduct cannot be justified even though the prosecutor's remarks may be in reply to those made by defense counsel. (People v. Perry (1972) 7 Cal. 3d 756, 789 [103 Cal Rptr. 161, 499 P.2d 129]; People v. Bain, supra, 5 Cal. 3d at p. 849; People v. Kirkes, supra, 39 Cal. 2d at p. 725; People v. Kelley, supra, 75 Cal. App. 3d at p. 690; People v. Talle, supra, 111 Cal. App. 2d at p. 677.) However, remarks by defense counsel must be considered in assessing the prejudicial effect of the prosecutorial misconduct. (People v. Perry, supra, 7 Cal. 3d at p. 789.)\n\nFor example, at one point during closing argument, Gindes stated:\n\n\"Mr. Van Meter told you, look at Carol, spontaneous, you'd ask her a question, she'd answer just like that. None of those long pauses. You know, just told it all how Rick didn't do anything. Really, folks, because a lawyer says something in words, does that make it true? You saw Carol on the witness stand. All long pauses, all these short answers, all of these I don't knows. Her head down. Sad. Troubled. Tormented. Or was she just a happy-go-lucky girl knowing her father had done nothing, out to tell the\n\nworld about? How many times did she look at her father? Once, twice, three times, not very many. She sat there miserable.\n\n\"You know, there's certain parts of the judicial system that I'm not altogether comfortable with, but we have to accept them as they are because all lawyers are told to respect the law. But Mr. Van Meter called Carol [P.] to the stand, called her as a witness, called her so she could betray herself in court, called her so yet another thing could be chalked up to what that kid will live through in her life. I say that was not one of the high points of the judicial system.\n\n\"Mr. Rubin: I'm going to object. This is appealing to sympathy.\n\n\"Mr. Fusilier: He's playing on the passions of this jury with his line. He's not talking about evidence now.\n\n\"The Court: Counsel, it's proper argument. Objection overruled.\n\n\"Mr. Gindes: He called her, and she miserably did the part. But what did you think about it? What did you think about her testimony? Again, you have to weigh it in the context of those six children.\"\n\nThere was nothing improper about Gindes arguing, based on Carol's demeanor and her manner of testifying, as well as the evidence contrary to her testimony, that her denials of molestations lacked credibility. (See People v. Reyes (1974) 12 Cal. 3d 486, 505 [116 Cal. Rptr. 217, 526 P.2d 225].) Moreover, his comments about the judicial system, if viewed in isolation, were innocuous and certainly not prejudicial. (See People v. Babbitt (1988) 45 Cal. 3d 660, 700 [248 Cal. Rptr. 69, 755 P.2d 253].) However, he went beyond permissible argument when he in essence accused defense counsel of contributing to the ruination of Carol's life. (See People v. Turner, supra, 145 Cal. App. 3d at pp. 673-674.) Moreover, his argument that defense counsel called Carol \"so she could betray herself in court\" can reasonably be interpreted as a subtle accusation that defense counsel knowingly presented perjured testimony. Such an accusation is clearly misconduct. As the California Supreme Court stated in People v. Thompson (1988) 45 Cal. 3d 86, 112 [246 Cal. Rptr. 245, 753 P.2d 37], cert. den. 488 U.S. 960 [102 L.Ed.2d 392, 109 S.Ct. 404]: \"A prosecutor may vigorously argue his case, marshalling the facts and arguing inferences to be drawn therefrom. [Citation.] We have held he may not express a personal belief in defendant's guilt, in part because of the danger that jurors may assume there is other evidence at his command on which he bases this conclusion. [Citation.] We have also held it improper for the prosecutor to imply that defense counsel has fabricated evidence or otherwise to portray defense counsel as the villain\n\nin the case. It is not necessary to find that such implication impinges upon defendant's constitutional right to counsel. [Citation.] Instead it is sufficient to note that defendant's conviction should rest on the evidence, not on derelictions of his counsel. [Citations.] Casting uncalled for aspersions on defense counsel directs attention to largely irrelevant matters and does not constitute comment on the evidence or argument as to inferences to be drawn therefrom.\" (See also, People v. McLain (1988) 46 Cal. 3d 97, 112-113 [249 Cal. Rptr. 630, 757 P.2d 569], cert. den. 489 U.S. 1072 [103 L.Ed.2d 824, 109 S.Ct. 1356]; People v. Adcox, supra, 47 Cal. 3d at pp. 236-237; People v. Bain, supra,5 Cal. 3d 839, 847; People v. Talle, supra, 111 Cal. App. 2d at pp. 676-677; People v. Podwys (1935) 6 Cal. App. 2d 71, 72-73 [44 P.2d 377]; contrast People v. Goldberg (1984) 161 Cal. App. 3d 170, 190-191 [207 Cal. Rptr. 431][permissible to argue that defense counsel was trying to sidetrack jury from the issues and confuse them, and that it was his job].)\n\nAnother example occurred during Gindes's argument regarding Dr. Woodling's testimony. Gindes was reciting Woodling's scholastic and professional record when he stated:\n\n\". . . He graduated sixth in a class of 72. He graduated through scholarships that he obtained in law school. He became one of ten Mead-Johnson fellows in the entire --\n\n\"Mr. Van Meter: Objection, argumentative, facts not in evidence.\n\n\"The Court: About the law school --\n\n\"Mr. Van Meter: That he obtained a scholarship at law school.\n\n\"Mr. Gindes: I'm sorry. Did I say that?\n\n\"The Court: Yes.\n\n\"Mr. Gindes: Mr. Van Meter scored another point. He was --\n\n\"Mr. Van Meter: Your Honor, I will object to that comment by counsel, ask that he be cited.\n\n\"The Court: Counsel, we're going forward. Objection is noted.\n\n\"Mr. Gindes: I guess he didn't go to law school. Then, he would get a percentage instead of an hourly rate. Anyway, his rank in medical school . . . .\"\n\nGindes also became an unsworn witness as to his own motives and conduct. Thus, he discussed his examination of Lisa:\n\n\". . . Lisa [P.], if our evidence is true, is a victim, not a hostile witness, but a victim. And she deserves to be treated decently, kindly and gently. Just like Carol did. Just like Angela did. And I treated them, even though it was my position to attack their credibility, as kindly and as gently and as softly as I could, because again, we have a duty not to traumatize people.\n\n\"Mr. Lorenz has no such duty, but he conducted himself in the same manner. Mr. Sims has no such duty. He has a duty to represent his client as vigorously as possible, but he was a gentleman and a gentle person, and I think I tried to be that way myself. Not to 'pressure' somebody.\n\n\"Remember when I was examining Lisa, every objection, you know, every question to be [ sic ] objected to, overruled, objected to for the same reason again, overruled, objected to, overruled, objected to for the same reason again, overruled. Badgering, arguing, going back and forth. It was almost impossible to get an answer out of her. Not because of her necessarily, but because objections were made. So, Mr. Van Meter says to you, he says, 'Lisa [P.] got up there and said none of this happened.'\"\n\nThe prosecutorial misconduct was not confined to closing argument. Interspersed throughout trial, to an extent this court has never before seen, were comments by one or both prosecutors which disparaged defense counsel; questioned their tactics, competence, and/or ethics; accused them of wasting time; etc. We have reviewed the entire record and have identified instances too numerous to chronicle where misconduct clearly or arguably occurred. Thus, the examples we set forth herein, while necessitating extensive quotes from the record, should not be viewed as isolated conduct, but as representative samples of what occurred. To set forth all of the misconduct would literally take many hundreds of pages.\n\nC. Comments Disparaging Defense Counsel\n\n1. \"Q [by Mr. Van Meter] Christine, when you heard Bob Fields say that Johnny [M.] had told him that all of these things had happened at the green house and nobody had any clothes on --\n\n\"Mr. Gindes: Did she just say that Bob Fields had told her that or is Mr. Van Meter making that up to confuse the witness?\n\n\"The Court: I don't think so. You want to rephrase it.\"\n\n2. \"Q [by Vendrasco] Okay. I want to talk about a different time now and a different day, okay, B.J.? And a different room.

It's hurting his ability to testify.\n\n\"Mr. Eyherabide: Object to those comments.\n\n\"Mr. Gindes: Bring to the attention of the Court under 288(c) it's traumatizing to the witness the way Mr. Eyherabide is objecting and the way he's --\n\n\"Mr. Rubin: Move to have this witness removed and have his testimony stricken if the problem is that he's having trouble answering questions under 288(c).\n\n\"Mr. Eyherabide: I'm just asking --\n\n\"Mr. Vendrasco: Witness removed like he's in jail or something.\n\n\"The Court: We're going to proceed.

Although the trial court determined that Forsythe could be impeached with his prior felony convictions, Gindes stated outside the jury's presence that he did not intend to do so on cross-examination; therefore, Gardiner did not need to do so on direct examination. The following subsequently occurred:\n\n\"Q [by Gardiner] With regard to your prior convictions --\n\n\"Mr. Gindes: Objection, your Honor, irrelevant.\n\n\"The Court: Sustained.\n\n\"By Mr. Gardiner:\n\n\"Q Mr. Forsythe, have you ever been --\n\n\"Mr. Gindes: Objection, irrelevant. Your Honor, we have gone into this matter. Is counsel trying to establish Pope 3-D or something like that?\n\n\"The Court: I don't know.\n\n\"Mr. Gindes: I think the Court made a specific order in this field, and I don't think counsel should ask questions that are going to guarantee a mistrial.\n\n\"Mr. Rubin: I totally disagree. There is no order with regard to this.\n\n\"The Court: What's the relevance? Excuse me. What's the relevance, sir?\n\n\"Mr. Gardiner: I haven't even asked the question.

The trial court is directed to enter its order dismissing the following counts: Counts 11, 13, 16, 20, 24, 27, 29, 31, 37, 39, 44, 51, 52, and 53 of Second Amended Information No. 27641; Counts 4, 11, 12, 13, 16, 19, 20, 22, 24, 25, 27, 37, 39, 42, 43, 44, 45, 47, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 55, 57, and 58 of Second Amended Information No. 27774; Counts 4, 10, 18, 20, 24, 29, and 31 of Amended Information No. 28244.\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003e1. To avoid confusion, appellants are referred to by their first names, except for the two Waynes. Tutti, Marcella's nickname, was frequently used by the children, friends, and family members.\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003e2. All further statutory references are to the Penal Code unless otherwise indicated.\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003e3. The December 17, 1984, minute order erroneously reflects amended informations filed in Nos. 27641 and 28244.\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003e4. Consistent with the children's testimony, this residence will be referred to as the green house.\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003e5. Gina's defense was that the boys, especially Johnny, had mistaken Carla Joyce for her. At the time of the swimming pool incident, which allegedly occurred sometime around June 10, 1984, Gina would have been approximately five months pregnant, as she was due to give birth in October.\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003e6. Richard \"Toby\" Tyler, an expert on child pornography, later testified that whether a pornographic videotape is quickly disseminated to a prospective buyer depends on the producer's primary motivation. If he or she is a pedophile or child molester, the tape will not be distributed quickly. If he or she primarily has a profit motive, however, distribution will usually be fast. It has always been Tyler's experience in the case of videotapes that the seller keeps the original tape as a master. For the same reason, a film producer almost always keeps the negatives from the still pictures; copies made from them are better than copies made from other copies. If someone over the course of a year had two- or three-hour pornographic sessions, both with videotaping equipment and still cameras, every other weekend, Tyler would expect to find some of the master material in his or her physical possession. However, at the first indication of any investigation, the person would immediately remove the master from his or her premises and put it in a safe place. Rarely would the master be destroyed.\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003e7. Forsythe subsequently described his tattoos, pictures of which were admitted into evidence. According to his testimony, he had a tattoo on his penis prior to 1982. The tattoo said \"Fuck this\" with an arrow pointing toward his abdomen.\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003e8. According to Janice, the track meet took place on a Saturday in May 1983. Rick placed the date as being May 21, 1983.\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003e9. Colleen testified she sometimes lived with Tutti and the boys and, on occasion, one or more of the boys walked in on her when she was in the process of dressing.\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003e10. According to Grace, she never lived with Tutti's boys. However, she talked to many people about her cherries tattoo, because it was a joke.\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003e11. Vicki Raye Pearce testified that her children's names are Andrea, Kenneth, Rebecca, and Joshua. Joshua was only two years old at the time of trial. However, Carla Joyce has two children, one of whom is named Joshua. The other is Danny. Yvonne Mailloux has a daughter named Angela.\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003e12. Prosecution witness Homer Horton lived across the street from the green house. During the latter part of 1982 and 1983, he noted an extensive amount of traffic in the area, which is semirural. People in new, flashy cars would park in front of Horton's residence late in the evening, go to the green house, enter, then leave a few minutes later. Horton suspected narcotics activity. However, although he occasionally saw little girls playing naked on the front lawn, he never saw a child nude on the front porch, nor did he see nude women anywhere about the green house. Although Horton was generally home in the daytime on weekends during 1982 and 1983, he heard no yelling or screaming coming from the green house, nor did he recall seeing anyone carrying photographic equipment.\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003e13. According to Roy Fizer, owner of D \u0026 D Auto Sales between September 1982 and July 1983, Dill was never a regular employee, although he helped out once in a while. Dill only worked there very occasionally. Fizer did not personally work Saturdays, although the lot was open. Once in a while he stopped by for a few minutes; sometimes Dill was there.\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003e14. Tanya Howze was the sales manager at Howze Auto Sales, and she worked every other Saturday during the time in question. According to her, it was rare for Dill to work there on a Saturday.\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003e15. Prosecution rebuttal witness Elvira England, the owner of the pizza parlor, could not recall seeing Dill there on a Saturday afternoon during 1982 or 1983. The restaurant's policy, which was explained to employees, was that they were not to have relatives or friends there while they were on duty. A friend or relative could come in and buy pizza, but they were not to disturb the employee. Glenn England, who worked at the pizza parlor every Saturday beginning at 4 p.m., never saw Dill there on a Saturday during the time in question. Both witnesses admitted they could not always see the entire pizza parlor, especially if they were in the office.\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003e16. According to Allen B., Amanda's father, Forsythe was living with Carla Joyce in June 1984. Allen was present when Joyce said something about pictures. Forsythe responded that everything had been taken care of. Joyce and Allen discussed pictures which were supposed to have been taken at the green house. Allen heard about them from newspapers and television and wanted to get them so he could get custody of Amanda away from child protective services. Forsythe stated he was afraid of being arrested himself. Allen later amended his testimony and stated that he and Joyce were the ones discussing photographs, with Joyce wanting to know where the pictures were he had taken of her and Colleen long before when they were both pregnant. When Forsythe said everything had been taken care of, Allen did not know what he meant.\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003e17. According to Allen B., in late 1982 Colleen said she had once injected crank.\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003e18. According to Maloney, they saw each other often on weekends. The Lake Isabella trip, which occurred in June or July 1983, covered a weekend. Maloney spent time with Grace when she was not working and it was convenient for her to get away. Even when she worked weekends, he saw her before or after work.\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003e19. Business and Professions Code section 6086.7 provides in part: \"Whenever a reversal of a judgment in a judicial proceeding is based in whole or in part upon gross misconduct . . ., the court that ordered reversal of the judgment shall cause the matter to be reported to the State Bar of California for investigation with regard to the appropriateness of initiating disciplinary action against the attorney. The court shall also notify the attorney involved that the matter has been referred to the State Bar for investigation.\" Andrew Gindes and Michael Vendrasco were coprosecutors in the instant case. While Vendrasco was guilty of misconduct, most instances were fairly isolated. Gindes's behavior, however, can only be termed gross misconduct. Accordingly, we hereby notify Andrew Gindes that we are reporting this matter to the State Bar in accordance with the foregoing provisions. (See People v. Ryner (1985) 164 Cal. App. 3d 1075, 1087, fn. 5 [211 Cal. Rptr. 140].)\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003e20. Where necessary for purposes of clarity, the examples are numbered.\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003e21. Defense counsel were: Ronald S. Sims (Grace), Richard Fusilier (Dill), Eugene R. Lorenz (Gina), Andrew Rubin (Rick), George Van Meter (Tutti), Dominic Eyherabide (Colleen), and Robert Gardiner (Forsythe).\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003e22. In Bonin, defense counsel failed to strictly comply with the requirements of the rule. However, the court found she achieved substantial compliance therewith by making motions for mistrial and to strike the challenged portions of testimony. Accordingly, the court reached the merits of the issue, since counsel \"gave the court more than ample opportunity to 'correct the abuse.'\" (Ibid.)\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003e23. Vendrasco presented the People's opening argument; Gindes handled closing argument.\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003e24. Two court reporters recorded the proceedings. One's transcript is entirely in upper case.\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003e25. All are references to terms used by Colleen in her diaries to indicate drug use.\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003e26. This remark was made by Grace during a conversation with Colleen after Colleen's arrest but prior to Grace's. Colleen asked Grace if Clovette, who was still at large as of the time of trial, was hiding. Grace replied, \"You betcha.\"\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003e27. Such a statement constitutes improper argument if there is substantial danger that jurors will interpret the statement of opinion or belief as being based on information other than evidence adduced at trial, but not if it is merely the prosecutor's view of deductions and inferences warranted by the evidence.
