    "body": "In the period from about 1960 to 1973 peoples throughout theworld have wakened to the awful truth that if man continuesrandom destruction of his natural environment, his naturalenvironment will ultimately destroy him.\n\nThis destruction of the environment is not confined to the land alone, or the sea alone or the air alone.\n\nInspired by this sudden consciousness of the perils of pollution, legislative bodies everywhere have passed legislation designed to diminish pollution of our environment. Our Maine Legislature has been in the forefront of those seeking to control, and where necessary abate, threats of environment destruction.\n\nIn 1970, recognizing and declaring that,\n\n\". . . the transfer of oil, petroleum products and their  by-products between vessels and vessels and onshore facilities  and vessels within the jurisdiction of the State and state  waters is a hazardous undertaking; that spills, discharges and  escape of oil, petroleum products and their by-products  occurring as a result of procedures involved in the transfer  and storage of such products pose threats of great danger and  damage to the marine, estuarine and adjacent terrestrial  environment of the State; . . .\"\n\n38 M.R.S.A. § 541\n\nthe Legislature of Maine passed the Oil Discharge Prevention and Pollution Control Act of 1970.\n\nPlaintiffs in these cases being directly affected by the operation of the Act have, by appropriate procedure, presented the Act to us that we may test it, that assurance may result that neither the Act, nor any portion thereof, offends the proscriptions of the Constitution of the United States and/or the Constitution of the State of Maine.\n\nWe shall never cease to be amazed by the genius of the little band of men who in 1787 conceived and penned the Charter which has endured all these many years. Our admiration is no less for the equally small group who in 1820, conceived and adopted the Charter of the State of Maine. Although there have been relatively minor amendments to both documents, both have remained viable and substantially unchanged with the passing years.\n\nAmazing though it may seem to those unfamiliar with the American system, those two marvelous instruments, born of another age, are still, in this year 1973, the Plimsoll line demarking that which legislative bodies may do and that which they cannot do.\n\nThough the economic, social and political conditions today are as dissimilar from the economic, social and political conditions existing in 1787 and 1820 as night is from day, the principles so plainly and concisely laid down in the two great Charters are as applicable to problems of the atomic age as to the age when the United States was a tiny nation nestled along the Atlantic Coast.\n\nBecause in 1803 Mr. Chief Justice Marshall in the landmark decision Marbury v. Madison, 5 U.S. (1 Cranch) 137, 2 L.Ed. 60, declared:\n\n\"It is emphatically the province and duty of the judicial  department to say what the law is.\"\n\nit is our duty, when called upon to do so by appropriate procedure, to test laws passed by legislative bodies to see that such laws are not wanting when measured against the proscriptions of our Charters.\n\n\"If, then, the courts are to regard the constitution; and the  constitution is superior to any ordinary act of the  legislature; the constitution, and not such ordinary act, must  govern the case to which they both apply.\"\n\nMarbury v. Madison, supra.\n\nIn the performance of our judicial duty we now proceed to examine 38 M.R.S.A. § 541-557 to see if our Legislature in enacting this law has done what the Constitution of Maine or the Constitution of the United States has forbidden it to do.\n\nThese cases are before this Court pursuant to Rule 72(b) M.R.C.P. upon request of all parties appearing and upon agreement as to all material facts, for us to render such decision as the rights of the parties require. The cases contain some factual differences. However, since the cases have many common issues of law, we shall treat them jointly.\n\nPlaintiffs in these actions seek declaratory judgments determining that Chapter 572 of the 1969 Public Laws of Maine, An Act Relating to Coastal Conveyance of Petroleum,\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e1\u003c/span\u003e violates various provisions of the United States and Maine Constitutions.\n\nWe find that within the factual framework here before us the statute is not unconstitutional on its face and as applied to these plaintiffs.\n\nThe Legislature has made an extensive statement of the purpose of the Act.\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e2\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\"The Legislature finds and declares that the highest and best  uses of the seacoast of the State are as a source of public and  private recreation and solace from the pressures of an  industrialized society, and as a source of public use and  private commerce in fishing, lobstering and gathering other  marine life used and useful in food production and other  commercial activities.\n\n\"The Legislature further finds and declares that the  preservation of these uses is a matter of the highest urgency  and priority and that such uses can only be served effectively  by maintaining the coastal waters, estuaries, tidal flats,  beaches and public lands adjoining the seacoast in as close to  a pristine condition as possible taking into account multiple  use accommodations necessary to provide the broadest possible  promotion of public and private interests with the least  possible conflicts in such diverse uses.\n\n\"The Legislature further finds and declares that the transfer  of oil, petroleum products and their by-products between  vessels and vessels and onshore facilities and vessels within  the jurisdiction of the State and state waters is a hazardous  undertaking; that spills, discharges and escape of oil,  petroleum products and their by-products occurring as a result  of procedures involved in the transfer and storage of such  products pose threats of great danger and damage to the marine,  estuarine and adjacent terrestrial environment of the State; to  owners and users of shoreline property; to public and private  recreation; to citizens of the State and other interests  deriving livelihood from marine-related activities; and to the  beauty of the Maine coast; that such hazards have frequently  occurred in the past, are occurring now and present future  threats of potentially catastrophic proportions, all of which  are expressly declared to be inimical to the paramount  interests of the State as herein set forth and that such state  interests outweigh any economic burdens imposed by the  Legislature upon those engaged in transferring oil, petroleum  products and their by-products and related activities.\n\n\"The Legislature intends by the enactment of this legislation  to exercise the police power of the State through the  Environmental Improvement Commission by conferring upon said  Commission the exclusive power to deal with the hazards and  threats of danger and damage posed by such transfers and  related activities; to require the prompt containment and  removal of pollution occasioned thereby; to provide procedures  whereby persons suffering damage from such occurrences may be  promptly made whole; and to establish a fund to provide for the  inspection and supervision of such activities and guarantee the  prompt payment of reasonable damage claims resulting therefrom.\n\n\"The Legislature further finds and declares that the  preservation of the public uses referred to herein is of grave  public interest and concern to the State in promoting its  general welfare, preventing disease, promoting health and  providing for the public safety, and that the State's interest  in such preservation outweighs any burdens of absolute  liability imposed by the Legislature upon those engaged in  transferring oil, petroleum products and their by-products and  related activities.\"\n\nThe substantive provisions of the Act contain a prohibition of the discharge of oil into or upon coastal waters and adjoining land and waters that drain into coastal waters.\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e3\u003c/span\u003e The activities of both oil terminals and the vessels which serve them are regulated and such terminals are required to obtain a license.\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e4\u003c/span\u003e Persons who discharge oil into or upon coastal waters are charged with the duty of cleaning up the spill to the satisfaction of the Commission and the Commission is empowered to effect a clean-up if the person responsible fails to do so or if the person responsible is unknown (the so-called \"mystery spills.\")\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e5\u003c/span\u003e\n\nThe sections of the Act which create the Coastal Protection Fund and provide for expenditures from it and reimbursements to it [sections 551 and 552], are the critical sections of the Act insofar as the questions raised in these actions are concerned.\n\nSection 551 creates the Fund and defines its uses. The Fund is a \"non-lapsing, revolving fund\" limited to four million dollars. The initial funding is effected by the imposition of an annual license fee determined on the basis of one-half cent per barrel of petroleum products transferred over water during the licensing period. The license fee is imposed on \"oil terminal facilities.\"\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e6\u003c/span\u003e When the four million dollar limit is attained, the license fee will drop to a level sufficient to meet the continuing administrative expenses, unreimbursed charges,\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e7\u003c/span\u003e and the costs of authorized research and development.\n\nThe Fund is to be used for making the initial payment of costs of cleaning up spills undertaken by the Commission under the authority of Section 548, and for compensating third party claims authorized by Section 551(5). Expenditures made for these purposes are to be recovered, with certain limitations, from the person \"permitting\" the unlawful discharge under Section 551(6).\n\nThe third party damage claims may be liquidated by agreement among the claimant, the Commission and the person causing the discharge. If agreement among these parties cannot be reached, the claim is to be submitted to a Board of Arbitration\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e8\u003c/span\u003e for action. Section 551(2) establishes this procedure as the exclusive means for third parties to recover damages.\n\nSection 552 provides for the liability of licensed oil terminal facilities. This liability includes responsibility not only for the acts of the servants and agents of the licensee but also makes the terminal vicariously liable for acts and omissions of carriers \"destined for the licensee's facilities\" from the time the vessel enters the twelve mile limit until the time the vessel leaves State waters. The second part of this section of the Act provides that the liability of the licensee shall be absolute. In any action for reimbursement against a terminal the State is not required to establish negligence. It need only plead and prove the fact of the prohibited discharge or other polluting condition and that it occurred at facilities under the control of the licensee or was attributable to carriers or others for whom the licensee is responsible as provided in the subchapter.\n\nA Justice of the Superior Court issued a Preliminary Injunction on June 24, 1970, providing that: all plaintiffs shall continue to operate under temporary licenses granted by the E.I.C.; each plaintiff shall complete a license application to be held by the Court until the case is decided; and no plaintiff shall be required to comply with subsections 4 and 6 of Section 551 nor with the \"vicarious liability\" provision of Section 552(1) pending further Order. This exemption was conditioned upon the maintenance of accurate records of the total volume of oil, in barrels, transferred by the plaintiffs and upon either the posting of a bond or the payment into an escrow account of one-half cent per barrel of oil transferred during this litigation.\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e9\u003c/span\u003e\n\nWe are to decide the constitutional issues raised by examining the Act on its face and as applied within the framework of the stipulated facts.\n\nIn passing on the constitutionality of any act the Court assumes the Legislature acted with knowledge of constitutional restrictions. All acts of the Legislature are presumed to be constitutional and this is a presumption of great strength. State v. Fantastic Fair \u0026 Karmil, 158 Me. 450, 186 A.2d 352 (1961); State v. Poulin, alias Pooler, 105 Me. 224, 74 A. 119 (1909).\n\nThe burden is upon the plaintiffs to show the unconstitutionality of the Act. Verreault v. City of Lewiston, 150 Me. 67, 104 A.2d 538 (1954); Inhabitants of the Town of Warren v. Norwood, 138 Me. 180, 24 A.2d 229 (1941). All reasonable doubts must be resolved in favor of constitutionality of the Act and if the Act is susceptible of more than one interpretation, we must adopt an interpretation, if one there be, which will render it constitutional. Crommett v. City of Portland, 150 Me. 217, 107 A.2d 841 (1954); In re Stubbs, 141 Me. 143, 39 A.2d 853 (1944).\n\nPortland Pipe Line is a Maine corporation engaged in business as a common carrier, licensed and regulated by the Interstate Commerce Commission, transporting oil by pipe line from its terminal in South Portland to the Canadian border at North Troy, Vermont. At this point the oil is delivered to a connecting common carrier for transportation to Montreal. All oil tendered to Pipe Line, under conditions set forth in its approved tariffs,\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e10\u003c/span\u003e is offloaded at its pier in South Portland and is received solely for transportation.\n\nPipe Line has no property interest in the oil thus received.\n\nThe oil is received under the supervision and control of customs officials, solely for export and cannot be diverted for use in Maine.\n\nPipe Line has no ownership interest in any of the vessels offloading at its pier nor does it charter or have contractual relationship with any of these vessels. The operational and navigational control of vessels proceeding to or leaving Pipe Line's pier is in the hands of the ship's Master and the harbor or docking pilot.\n\nExcept for a small amount of oil received in 1969, all oil offloaded at Pipe Line's pier during the past six years has been shipped from points in foreign countries. All oil received at its facilities in the near future will be of foreign origin. All vessels delivering oil to its pier, whether United States or foreign flag vessels, hold Coast Guard certificates, or the equivalent, and have established financial responsibility under federal regulations.\n\nPlaintiffs in the second action are ten major oil companies — American, Chevron, Cities Service, Getty, Gulf, Humble, Mobil, Shell, Sun and Texaco — incorporated in states other than Maine and qualified to do business in Maine. Each operates an oil terminal facility located on Portland Harbor. In addition, seven of these Plaintiffs have oil terminal facilities upon navigable waters in other parts of the State.\n\nThere are occasional vessel-to-vessel transfers which take place in Hussey Sound (Portland Harbor). The products are transferred from tankers to barges which then proceed to terminals in Maine and other states.\n\nAlmost all petroleum products used in Maine are offloaded at these facilities.\n\nApproximately thirty percent of the products received is fuel for use in internal combustion engines. Most of the products come to Maine from points within the United States. However a substantial percentage has been shipped directly from foreign sources. The petroleum products are then distributed from plaintiffs' terminals to points in Maine and in other nearby states. Exceptions to this general manner of distribution include aviation fuel, shipped under bond from Caribbean refineries, brought into Maine to service international aircraft, and fuel, also brought into Maine under bond, used to bunker foreign vessels.\n\nThe oil companies have a possessory interest in most products offloaded at their terminals. Once again there are exceptions such as the bonded fuels and the transfer of oil at one of the plaintiff's terminals which belongs to another distributor.\n\nThe vessels arriving at the terminals may be under charter or, in some instances, owned by the terminal operator. The navigational and federal regulatory procedures are identical to those of ships destined for the Pipe Line terminal.\n\nI Gasoline Tax\n\nThe oil companies contend that inasmuch as the fee for licensing their terminals is based on the transfer of gasoline or other motor vehicle fuels and since the revenues thus derived are used under the Act for purposes unrelated to highway or bridge construction or the enforcement of traffic laws, the Act conflicts with the State Constitution.\n\nArticle IX, Sec. 19 of the Maine Constitution provides:\n\n\"All revenues derived from fees, excises and license taxes  relating to registration, operation and use of vehicles on  public highways, and to fuels used for the propulsion of such  vehicles shall be expended solely for cost of administration,  statutory refunds and adjustments, payment of debts and  liabilities incurred in construction and reconstruction of  highways and bridges, the cost of construction, reconstruction,  maintenance and repair of public highways and bridges under the  direction and supervision of a state department having  jurisdiction over such highways and bridges and expense for  state enforcement of traffic laws and shall not be diverted for  any purpose, provided that these limitations shall not apply to  revenue from an excise tax on motor vehicles imposed in lieu of  personal property tax.\"\n\nWe agree that the statutory uses of the revenue derived from the transfer of motor vehicle fuels prescribed by the Act are not consistent with those specified in Maine Constitution, Article IX, § 19. The issue for this Court then, is whether or not the revenues derived from the license fees paid by oil terminal facilities constitute \"revenues derived from fees, excises and license taxes relating . . . to fuels used for the propulsion\" of vehicles on public highways.\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e11\u003c/span\u003e\n\nThe rules which guide this Court in determining the meaning of constitutional provisions are set forth in Opinion of the Justices, 142 Me. 409, 60 A.2d 903 (1947). There we said\n\n\"The fundamental rule of construction of statutory and of  constitutional provisions is that the language shall be  interpreted in accordance with the intention with which it was  used, if that result may be accomplished by giving words their  ordinary and usual significance.\"\n\nAnd further,\n\n\"It is proper in construing constitutional language to give  decisive weight to the history of its development.\"\n\n142 Me. at 415, 60 A.2d at 906.\n\nThe Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts, in construing a constitutional amendment, stated that the amendment\n\n\" . . . was written to be understood by the voters to whom it  was submitted for approval. It is to be interpreted in the  sense most obvious to the common intelligence.\"\n\nYont v. Secretary of Commonwealth, 275 Mass. 365, 366, 176 N.E. 1, 2 (1931).\n\nMaine first began deriving revenue from motor vehicle fuels in 1923 with the enactment of a one cent per gallon tax.\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e12\u003c/span\u003e In later sessions the Legislature, while increasing the levy, allowed exemptions to be claimed by certain users of gasoline.\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e13\u003c/span\u003e The plan of the \"gasoline tax\" was to focus on those who derived benefits as users of the highway system as the class subject to the tax.\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e14\u003c/span\u003e While the entire tax has never been subject to an exemption,\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e15\u003c/span\u003e that part imposed without exemption was rationalized as a minimum payment by otherwise exempt users for residual benefits derived from good roads.\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e16\u003c/span\u003e The minimum gasoline tax collected from otherwise exempt users has also been expended for purposes other than specified in Article IX, Section 19.\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e17\u003c/span\u003e It is apparent to this Court that the gasoline tax statutes are intended to result in taxation of highway users.\n\nPlaintiffs contend this cannot be the intention of the Legislature because the tax is imposed on gasoline distributors. Because the tax is imposed in the first instance upon distributors in no way alters the legislative intent to have the tax fall upon highway users. The distributor is allowed to \"pass on\" the tax. It is the \"non-highway\" user of gasoline who may receive a refund. The imposition of the tax on the distributor was merely a means adopted by the Legislature to simplify the tax collection process.\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e18\u003c/span\u003e\n\nIn 1934 Congress became convinced that it was unfair to tax motor vehicle transportation unless the revenues thus derived were applied to the construction and maintenance of highways. To further this end. Congress passed what is now 23 U.S.C. § 126, which provided that federal highway funds would be withheld from any state which did not apply gasoline taxes and other taxes on motor vehicle owners and operators to highway purposes.\n\nThe Maine Legislature responded in 1936 by reserving for highway purposes the taxes derived from the \"tax imposed on internal combustion fuel.\"\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e19\u003c/span\u003e The Legislature, shortly thereafter, amended the statute to allow these funds to be used for other than highway purposes pending the collection of general revenues.\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e20\u003c/span\u003e The constitutional provision now in question was adopted by the people in 1943. The Legislative Record does not indicate that the anti-diversion amendment was to be any broader in scope than the 1936 statute. The Legislature and the people had been accustomed since 1923 to the \"gasoline tax,\" a tax imposed on highway users. It was this revenue that was protected from diversion to non-highway uses.\n\nThe Coastal Conveyance Act imposes a license fee upon those engaged in over-water transfers of petroleum products. From the history of gasoline taxation in Maine, we hold that the revenues thus derived are not revenues \"derived from fees, excises and license taxes relating to fuels used for the propulsion of . . . \" motor vehicles, and therefore it is not constitutionally required that the revenues derived under the Act be used for highway purposes.\n\nII Due Process\n\nPlaintiffs contend that the arbitration procedure provided by Section 551 of the Act offends the due process provisions of both the United States and Maine Constitutions.\n\nA. Procedure\n\nThe Act provides that hearings \"shall be informal\" and that the rules of evidence \"shall not be binding.\"\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e21\u003c/span\u003e The terminal operators brand this a \"no-rule\" system and argue that due process requires procedural safeguards akin to judicial proceedings.\n\nA judicial proceeding is not an element of due process. Randall v. Patch, 118 Me. 303, 108 A. 97 (1919). Procedural due process requires no particular form of procedure. State v. Johnson, Me., 265 A.2d 711 (1970). The rules of evidence are not binding on administrative bodies as they are empowered by statute to receive evidence not ordinarily admissible in judicial proceedings. 5 M.R.S.A. § 2405.\n\nIn State v. Johnson, supra, this Court ruled that the hearing provisions of the Wetlands Act met \"all requirements of due process.\" That Act merely provided for a hearing with notice and made no attempt to set out rules of procedure for such a hearing.\n\nWhile it is well settled that the terminal operators are entitled to such procedural processes as will satisfy demands of due process, Kovack v. Licensing Board of City of Waterville, 157 Me. 411, 173 A.2d 554 (1961), we cannot in the present posture of this case anticipate that an arbitration proceeding conducted in the future will, in fact, offend due process requirements.\n\nPlaintiffs' complaint in this regard is premature.\n\nIn Hannah v. Larche, 363 U.S. 420, 80 S.Ct. 1502, 4 L.Ed.2d 1307 (1960), cited by the plaintiffs, the Court was concerned with determining whether specific rules of procedure adopted by the Commission on Civil Rights satisfied requirements of the Due Process Clause in the Fifth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States.\n\nIn the instant case we have no such specific rules before us as none has been adopted. We can only say \"due process of law\" or \"the law of the land\" (Maine Constitution, Article I, Sec. 6), does not require a hearing before a judicial tribunal carried out with all the trappings known to judicial proceedings whenever any right or liability of a person is being determined in an administrative hearing.\n\nIn effect the plaintiffs ask us to now declare that arbitration proceedings which may be conducted in the future will necessarily violate due process requirements because the Act provides that such proceedings shall be informal and rules of evidence shall not be binding.\n\nThis we cannot do.\n\n\"One who seeks to assert a particular conglomerate of  circumstances in which the operation of the statute might be  unconstitutional must prove such facts in an actual case to  test the constitutionality of the statute, as applied, rather  than to seek to invalidate it on its face by hypothesizing  marginal situations in which the statute might be conceived to  operate with unduly oppressive or unjustifiably arbitrary impact indicative of unconstitutionality.\"\n\nState v. Richardson, Me., 285 A.2d 842 at 846 (1972)\n\nThe Act provides for review of the decision of the Board of Arbitration in Superior Court. Such review is limited, however, to \"matters relating to abuse of discretion by the board,\" since the board's determination is final.\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e22\u003c/span\u003e Plaintiffs contend that the board has such broad discretion that abuse would be impossible to show, therefore, the right of appeal is \"virtually meaningless.\"\n\nThe right of appeal is not a constitutional right. It may be granted subject to such restrictions, limitations and conditions as the Legislature may attach to it. Harrington v. Harrington, Me., 269 A.2d 310 (1970).\n\nEmpowering an administrative agency with a discretionary fact-finding function is not a violation of due process. This Court has upheld such a delegation of authority in Chequinn Corp. v. Mullen, 159 Me. 375, 193 A.2d 432 (1963); Kovack v. Licensing Bd. of City of Waterville, supra, and American Fidelity Co. v. Mahoney, 157 Me. 507, 174 A.2d 446 (1961).\n\nIn any event, the Board of Arbitration will not exercise \"unfettered\" discretion in determining the amount of third party damage claims. The Act provides for review on matters of discretion. The board cannot engage in arbitrary or capricious action. A reviewing Court in determining whether the board has acted reasonably may decide if the board decision has a rational factual basis or has substantial support in the evidence. Central Maine Power Co. v. Waterville Urban Renewal Authority, Me., 281 A.2d 233 (1971). Therefore the basic guarantees of due process are observed in the Act.\n\nPlaintiffs' final procedural due process argument is based on a potential construction of Sections 551 and 552. They contend that if the spill was caused by a vessel not owned or controlled by the licensee for which the ship is destined, the board of arbitration will decide the issue of damages with only the Commission, the vessel causing the spill and the third person suffering harm as parties.\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e23\u003c/span\u003e This determination of the amount of damages is final.\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e24\u003c/span\u003e The terminal operator is made expressly liable for the acts of vessels destined for its facilities.\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e25\u003c/span\u003e If the Commission cannot recover the expenditures from the Fund from the vessel, the matter may be turned over to the Attorney General for collection.\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e26\u003c/span\u003e\n\nPlaintiffs contend that in any such action brought against them the issue of damages is foreclosed by the decision of the board. They continue, since the Act makes no provision for the licensee to be a party at the board's hearing on damages, the procedure violates the right of the terminal operator to receive notice and a hearing on the issue of damages.\n\nIf the construction advanced by the plaintiffs is the only reasonable construction of Sections 551 and 552, a serious issue of procedural due process arises.\n\nNotice and the opportunity to be heard are two essential elements of due process of law. Randall v. Patch, supra.\n\nThe duty of this Court is to determine if these provisions of the Act are susceptible of a reasonable interpretation which would satisfy constitutional requirements.\n\nIf there is such an interpretation, we are bound to adopt that interpretation as it sustains the statute. In re Stubbs, supra.\n\nSection 551(3)(E) provides that determinations of the board as to third party damages shall be final. We must assume that the Legislature acted with knowledge of the constitutional requirements of due process. Martin v. Maine Savings Bank, 154 Me. 259, 147 A.2d 131 (1958). The board, in meeting the statutory purpose of establishing procedures whereby injured third parties may be promptly made whole,\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e27\u003c/span\u003e merely decides the amount to be paid out of the Fund to the aggrieved third party.\n\nIt is this decision that is final, subject to review for abuse of discretion.\n\nThe decision binds the parties to the arbitration proceeding as to expenditures from the Fund.\n\nThe Commission is then directed, under Section 551(6), to seek reimbursement of the third party damages awarded plus the costs of clean-up, subject to certain limitations not here in issue. If reimbursement is not forthcoming, the Commission is directed to turn over the matter to the Attorney General for collection. Such collection is to be effected by an independent judicial proceeding.\n\nThe terms of the Act do not preclude the issue of the amount of recovery from being decided in a subsequent proceeding against one not a party to the hearing before the board.\n\nWe read the phrase \"turned over to the Attorney General for collection\" as a statutory direction for the state to seek full recovery for expenditures from the Fund, not as a mandate that the Court assess the amount of damages found by the board once the Court has decided the issue of causation.\n\nNeither are we convinced that, as plaintiffs assert, Section 552 makes the damages assessed by the board binding on the Court. Plaintiffs cite\n\n\". . . the state need only plead and prove the fact of the  prohibited discharge . . .\" (Emphasis added)\n\nas a legislative determination that damages (amount of reimbursement to the Fund) need not be proved.\n\nThe section is entitled \"Liabilities of licensees.\" The subsection is headed \"State need not plead or prove negligence.\" The use of the word \"only\" exempts the State from proving anything other than causation in order to establish liability. It does not require that causation be the single issue before the Court in the collection suit brought by the Attorney General.\n\nReading the section as a whole, we are convinced that the Legislature intended to provide that the State be required to plead and prove only the fact of the prohibited discharge to establish liability. It was never intended that there be no requirement that the State prove damages in the action before the Court.\n\nWe find, and therefore accept, that the Act is subject to a reasonable interpretation that provides the oil terminal operators with notice and an opportunity to be heard on the issue of damages in the independent suit for collection required by the Act.\n\nB. Substance\n\nPlaintiffs next argue that the Act violates the substantive due process guarantees of both the United States and Maine Constitutions. First, the imposition upon terminal operators of vicarious liability for the acts of vessels not owned or controlled by the operators is advanced as an unconstitutional taking. Second, it is asserted that the imposition of license fees upon terminal operators in order to finance a state-wide conservation effort deprives them of property without due process of law.\n\nAs to the first issue, plaintiffs concede that in some instances vicarious liability may be imposed without violating due process guarantees. Ownership of property and agency relationships are examples of instances where one person may be properly held liable for the acts of another.\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e28\u003c/span\u003e Plaintiffs quite accurately point out that there exists a common thread in these cases; either in the exercise of a degree of control over the acting party by the person held liable or inasmuch as there is a voluntary relationship entered into by the parties. Absent such a \"control relationship,\" plaintiffs argue that there can be no imposition of vicarious liability.\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e29\u003c/span\u003e Therefore, as to Pipe Line and in some measure as to the oil companies the Act is claimed to be unconstitutional.\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e30\u003c/span\u003e\n\nWe cannot agree because in our view the \"control relationship\" cases cited by plaintiffs are not an exhaustive list of instances where vicarious liability may be constitutionally imposed.\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e31\u003c/span\u003e\n\nIn Atlantic Coast Line v. Riverside Mills, 219 U.S. 186, 31 S.Ct. 164, 55 L.Ed. 167 (1911), the Supreme Court was asked to determine the constitutionality of the Carmack Amendment.\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e32\u003c/span\u003e By this amendment, a railroad receiving goods to be shipped over more than one rail line was held liable for damage to the goods occurring while the goods were in the hands of a subsequent carrier.\n\nThe contract for carriage entered into by the parties expressly exempted the initial carrier from any obligations once the goods passed beyond its line. The contract also specifically denied any agency between the initial and subsequent carriers. The subsequent carriers were, by the terms of the contract, the agents of the shipper. The Court indicated that:\n\n\"The general doctrine accepted by this court, in the absence  of legislation, is, that a carrier, unless there be a special  contract, is only bound to carry over its own line and then  deliver to a connecting carrier.\" 219 U.S. at 197, 31 S.Ct. at  166.\n\nTherefore both by the terms of the carriage contract and by the doctrines of common law the initial carrier could not be held liable for the acts of another. The effect of the Carmack Amendment then was to statutorily impress an agency relationship upon initial and subsequent carrier. As a result of this imposed agency relationship the statute made the initial carrier vicariously liable for the acts of subsequent carriers. The Supreme Court upheld this imposition of liability as a constitutionally authorized act of government.\n\nThe Court stressed the mutually advantageous relationship of the railroads. Although independently managed, they were cooperating in a profit-making enterprise. The Court saw no constitutional infirmity in imposing liability on one railroad for the acts of another in order to further a valid public policy. That policy was to facilitate recovery by a shipper who would be otherwise forced to determine on what line the damage to his goods occurred and maintain litigation in a distant forum.\n\nThe valid policy justified the imposition of vicarious liability.\n\nThe seeming inequity in holding one liable for the acts of another disappears when the \"business association\" is examined. The Court found that the railroads had the facilities and were free to institute procedures whereby, among themselves, primary liability could be accurately located. The Court further stated that because there existed the possibility that such a recoupment procedure might prove ineffective in certain instances was no reason to hold the Carmack Amendment invalid.\n\nAtlantic Coast Line stands for the proposition that government, in furthering a valid policy, may constitutionally impress vicarious liability on one party to a \"business association\" for the acts of another party to that association, where the party held liable has the means, within the association, to ultimately place primary liability upon the party causing the loss.\n\nIn State ex rel. Nilsen v. Whited et al., 239 Or. 149, 396 P.2d 758 (1964), the Oregon Supreme Court was asked to declare a statute\n\n\". . . unconstitutional and void as a denial of substantive due  process in that it is not within the power of the legislature  to create a debt from one person to another without the consent  of the person charged unless for some breach of contract,  express or implied, or for some tort or crime. . . .\"\n\nThe statute\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e33\u003c/span\u003e was directed at persons holding a dispenser's liquor license. Such persons who operated an establishment where food is cooked and served would be held liable, within limits, for the wages owed to the individuals employed in the kitchen and dining facilities of that establishment. This liability was imposed even though, as in State ex rel Nilsen, the kitchen and dining facilities were operated as a separate business entity by a third person.\n\nThe Court upheld the statute without examining the type of relationship between the dispenser and the operator of the kitchen and dining facilities. The court made no finding of agency either express or implied. The liability furthered reasonable state purposes and as applied to one party to a business association for the debts of another party to that association, was not violative of substantive due process rights.\n\nWe find from these cases that there is no constitutional bar to the imposition of vicarious liability upon one engaged in business, for the acts of a business associate, when both are engaged in a mutually beneficial relationship and there is, in the relationship, adequate opportunity to locate, among the business associates, the primary liability.\n\n\"In the absence of organic restraint, the legislature may for  the general welfare of society impose obligations and  responsibilities otherwise nonexistent; and the creation of  such liability, even though imposed irrespective of fault or  agency, is not violative of due process, if it rests on  reasonable grounds of policy . . . .\" 16A C.J.S. Constitutional  Law §§ 630, p. 878.\n\nThe Supreme Court, in Lincoln Federal Labor Union et al v. Northwestern Iron \u0026 Metal Co. et al., 335 U.S. 525, 69 S.Ct. 251, 93 L.Ed. 212 (1949), commented on the role that the due process clause played in evaluating legislative enactments.\n\n\"This Court beginning at least as early as 1934, when the  Nebbia [Nebbia v. People of State of New York, 291 U.S. 502, 54  S.Ct. 505, 78 L.Ed. 940] case was decided, has steadily  rejected the due process philosophy enunciated in the Adair  [Adair v. United States, 208 U.S. 161, 28 S.Ct. 277, 52 L.Ed.  436]-Coppage [Coppage v. State of Kansas, 206 U.S. 1, 35 S.Ct.  240, 59 L.Ed. 441] line of cases. In doing so it has  consciously returned closer and closer to the earlier  constitutional principle that states have power to legislate  against what are found to be injurious practices in their  internal commercial and business affairs, so long as their laws  do not run afoul of some specific federal constitutional  prohibition, or of some valid federal law.\" 335 U.S. at 536, 69  S.Ct. at 257.\n\nThe issue to be decided then is whether or not there are any reasonable objectives which the Legislature reasonably sought to further by imposing vicarious liability upon the oil terminal operators for the acts or omissions of vessels destined for or departing from their piers. We find that such reasonable objectives exist, and that the imposition of vicarious liability was a reasonable method of furthering those objectives.\n\nTwo of the prime purposes of the Act are the speedy settlement of third party claims and the immediate clean-up of spills. Both objectives require the presence of a sufficient amount of money in the Fund to meet emergencies. The ongoing activities under the Act, research and development, administration, etc., also require that the Act be properly funded.\n\nAll of these objectives would be severely hampered if the Fund became depleted. A major oil spill could bring about this result. The Legislature, in contemplating such a turn of events, could reasonably have made the judgment that the most appropriate means of keeping the Fund at an operating level would be to allow an action for reimbursement against the oil terminal operator.\n\nRequiring the Commission, in all instances, to proceed against the vessel might cause delays in the litigation. In fairness to third parties there is a six-month period after the spill in which damage claims may be filed. It is possible that in this six-month period the vessel will have departed and will no longer be subject to the jurisdiction of Maine or United States courts. The oil terminal operator does its business in Maine, is always amenable to suit, and therefore it could reasonably be expected that suit against the terminal operator would be more likely to maintain the Fund at an operating level than would suit against the vessel.\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e34\u003c/span\u003e The second substantive due process argument is, that the act as a whole, takes the property of the plaintiffs exclusively, to fund a state-wide conservation process.\n\nPlaintiffs rely on State v. Johnson, Me., 265 A.2d 711 (1970). That case is not controlling.\n\nIn Johnson a property owner challenged the constitutionality of the Wetlands Act.\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e35\u003c/span\u003e Her property consisted of coastal wetlands of the type the Legislature sought to preserve for conservational reasons. The value of the land in the condition required by the Act was nil. Since the Act prohibited Mrs. Johnson from altering the land to increase its commercial value, this Court held that the State had taken her land within the meaning of the due process clause. Forcing Mrs. Johnson to relinquish any value her property might have, without compensation, in order to advance a public purpose was held constitutionally impermissible.\n\nThese plaintiffs have not experienced an unconstitutional taking merely because their profit margins may have been decreased. The United States Supreme Court recognized this when it stated, \"many forms of regulation reduce the net return of the enterprise; yet that gives rise to no constitutional infirmity.\" Day-Brite Lighting, Inc. v. Missouri, 342 U.S. 421, 424, 72 S.Ct. 405, 408, 96 L.Ed. 469, 473 (1952).\n\nThere has been no showing here that the license fees imposed by the Act are ruinous or oppressive. No claim has been made that any terminal operator will be precluded from that occupation as a result of the license fees. Therefore the only due process limitations on the Act are those applied to the State's power to tax.\n\nThe limitations placed on the State's power to tax by the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment are extremely limited. Such was the statement of the Supreme Court in Wisconsin v. J.C. Penney Co., 311 U.S. 435, 61 S.Ct. 246, 85 L.Ed. 267 (1940).\n\n\"At best, the responsibility for devising just and productive  sources of revenue challenges the wit of legislators. Nothing  can be less helpful than for courts to go beyond the extremely  limited restrictions that the Constitution places upon the  states and to inject themselves in a merely negative way into  the delicate processes of fiscal policy-making.\" 311 U.S. at  445, 61 S.Ct. at 250.\n\nSee also, Northwestern States Portland Cement Co. v. Minnesota, 358 U.S. 450, 79 S.Ct. 357, 3 L.Ed.2d 421 (1959).\n\n\"That test is whether property was taken without due process  of law, or, if paraphrase we must, whether the taxing power  exerted by the state bears fiscal relation to protection,  opportunities and benefits given by the state. The simple but  controlling question is whether the state has given anything  for which it can ask return.\" 311 U.S. at 444, 61 S.Ct. 250.\n\nThe Court found that Wisconsin had granted J.C. Penney the \"substantial privilege\" of conducting its enterprise in the State, and thus the tax was supported by that privilege.\n\nThe imposition of a license fee upon those off-loading oil over the waters of the State of Maine is justified in a like manner.\n\nThe oil terminal operators enjoy a \"substantial privilege\" when they engage in such an activity, an activity made possible by the protections and advantages provided by government. To paraphrase Mr. Justice Frankfurter, the incidence of the license fee, as well as its measure, is tied to the activity which the State of Maine has made possible, insofar as government is the prerequisite for the fruits of civilization,\n\nfor which we pay taxes. Wisconsin v. J.C. Penney, supra, 311 U.S. at 446, 61 S.Ct. 250.\n\nIn State of Maine v. Stinson Canning Co., 161 Me. 320, 211 A.2d 553 (1965), this Court decided the sardine tax was constitutional. This tax was a fixed amount levied on each case of sardines placed in the \"channels of trade.\"\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e36\u003c/span\u003e Concerning that tax we said:\n\n\"Every intendment must be made in favor of the validity of  the law, if it appears that the means adopted are suitable to  the end in view, impartial in operation, not unduly oppressive  upon the individuals, and has a real and substantial relation  to their purpose.\" 161 Me. at 323, 211 A.2d at 555.\n\nThe license fee and the Fund created thereby are eminently suited to protecting the State and its residents from the harm caused by oil spills.\n\nEmploying the State's power to tax for this admittedly public purpose satisfies the first requirement of Stinson Canning Co.\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003e1.

Plaintiffs cite State v. A/S Nye Kristianborg, 84 F.

The case involved a Maryland statute allowing an in rem action against a vessel for wrongful death. Under the statute the action might be maintained even though the vessel was under the compulsory control of a pilot or under the control of a charterer. The case held that such a statute could not be applied retroactively. It did not hold the statute to be unconstitutional as violating substantive due process. The same statute was applied, ten years later, in State v. Weyerhaeuser Steamship Company, 176 F. Supp. 664 (D.C. 1959) and State v. A/S Nabella, 176 F.

Pipe Line does not own, charter, or have control of any of the vessels destined for its terminal. Since it is a common carrier it may not refuse to transport the oil tendered at its South Portland terminal. It has no possessory interest in the oil. The oil companies, in varying degrees, receive oil from vessels not owned, leased or controlled by them. Some of these terminals off-load oil owned by other companies. Thus Pipe Line, and to some extent the other plaintiffs, are held liable for acts of vessels in which they have no ownership interest and over which they exercise no control. Insofar as the Pipe Line is concerned, it engages in an involuntary relationship with the ships destined for its terminal because of its inability to refuse to off-load and transport the cargoes of these vessels.\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003e31.

These facilities are engaged in handling oil to such a limited extent that we believe the Legislature has refrained from requiring that they too be licensed because, as is the case of marinas under Section 545(3), the legislative finding indicated that the likelihood of significant damage due to spills from these sources is remote.\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003eWe cannot say that this finding is irrational.\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003eConsidering not only the potential incidence of spills but also the potential magnitude of such spills, we hold that distinctions drawn between oil terminal operators and other shore-based oil facilities are based on actual differences.\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003eSince the purpose of the Act is the preservation of the State's seacoast, it is reasonable to impose a higher degree of liability upon those whom the Legislature has found to constitute a higher risk to that protected interest.

We must consider vessels carrying oil only for internal uses separately from vessels transporting oil for delivery, i.e., tankers.\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003eVessels in Maine waters carrying oil for internal use only, could reasonably be found to create a lesser risk of a spill and undoubtedly may be found to create a risk of lesser magnitude. The yacht, the lobster boat, or even the larger commercial ships traveling in Maine waters cannot be seen to create the same risk of a major oil spill as does a tanker in Maine waters. Since a vessel with oil on board for internal purposes only constitutes a lesser risk, it may be treated differently consistent with equal protection guarantees. Armour \u0026 Co. v. North Dakota, supra.\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003eThe class of tankers must be further divided into those tankers merely passing through Maine waters and those carriers \"destined for or leaving a licensee's facility.\"\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003eTankers merely passing along the coast of Maine, while posing a danger, are not engaged in the kind of activities which result in as grave a danger as those vessels in Maine waters for the purpose of off-loading oil. The act of bringing a large vessel into port, of navigating the hazards which arise as one nears land is a danger not posed by tankers merely traveling along sea lanes which pass through Maine waters. These vessels will not be engaged in the vessel-to-vessel or vessel-to-shore transfer of oil and hence will not expose the State and its inhabitants to the dangers inherent in that operation. We hold that factual differences relating to the dangers posed by tankers passing through Maine waters and the over-water transfer of oil by licensed facilities permit the imposition\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003eof different standards of liability.

Plaintiffs assert that the peril, both in magnitude and probability, of a spill from one of these tankers and from a terminal are factually indistinguishable.42. Therefore, the imposition of absolute liability upon the terminal and not upon the vessels going to or coming from a licensed facility is a violation of the Equal Protection Clause.\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003eBut in cases of spills caused by such vessels, the State may recover upon an absolute liability basis. This is true because the terminal is vicariously liable for spills caused by such vessels under the terms of the Act. This provision renders remote the likelihood of suits against tankers \"destined for or leaving a licensed facility,\" since the State will always have jurisdiction over the terminals and may employ the absolute liability standard in suits against the terminals. The terminals can, in effect, impose the same liability upon these tankers through \"hold-harmless\" agreements. See the discussion of vicarious liability, supra.[fn42A]\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003eThe statute thus does not require discrimination on its face. Discriminatory enforcement of the statute may, of course, be attacked through an \"as applied challenge.\" Since we have also found actual differences between oil terminals and other potential causes of oil spills, namely, vessels not \"destined for or leaving\" a terminal and other shore-based facilities, we find the discriminatory treatment not to be a violation of equal protection guarantees.\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003ePlaintiffs' second equal protection argument is that the creation of a fund to insure the prompt payment of third party claims, when applied to isolated industries, is a procedure long held by this Court to violate the Equal Protection Clause. Plaintiffs rely on a series of cases dealing with Legislative attempts to assist milk producers in receiving compensation for their products.\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003eThe milk producer legislation used various mechanisms such as licenses, security bonds, and the requirement of semi-monthly payments to aid farmers in receiving, on a regular and guaranteed basis, payment for milk sold to milk processors.\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003eIn State v.

A statutory procedure existed, in lieu of an action at common law, whereby a jury would decide the issue of damages resulting from construction of a mill dam. Although the right to have such damages assessed by a jury existed when the jury trial section of the Constitution was adopted, and would have existed at common law in the absence of statute, that right did not become one of constitutional dimension. That is, Article I, Section 20, did not guarantee that the determination of damages from flowage would always be an issue for the jury.48.\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003eBy P.L.

In Ingram v. Maine Water Co., 98 Me. 566, 57 A. 893 (1904), this provision was challenged as a violation of petitioner's right to a jury trial. The Court relying on Hill v. Baker and Moor v.

This determination should be based solely on the nature of the new cause of action.

The procedure whereby third party damages are determined, paid from the Fund, and then recovered back in a reimbursement suit does not sound in equity. Merely inserting the Fund as a middleman in what would otherwise be a suit for damages against the terminal operator does not alter the fact that the procedure is one at law, a procedure, consequently, which must provide for a jury determination of facts as a matter of right.\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003eAlthough the State agrees with plaintiffs' interpretation of Section 551(3)E, making the determination of third party damages by the board of arbitrators binding in the subsequent reimbursement suit, this is not the only possible interpretation. The word \"final\" appearing in the section applies to the determination of the amount to be paid by the State Treasurer from the Fund to third party claimants. The entire scheme of arbitration is directed at speedy payment of claims of property damage and loss of income. The object is to provide funds immediately so that private persons may institute \"clean up\" measures on their property and so that these persons will not have to endure protracted legal proceedings while they are being deprived of their livelihoods or use of their property due to the spill.\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003eWhereas the \"final\" decision of the board of arbitration fixes the amount to be paid to injured third parties from the Fund, the reimbursement suit fixes the amount of a licensee's obligation to the Fund.

They rely upon Yick Wo v. Hopkins, 118 U.S. 356, 6 S.Ct. 1064, 30 L.Ed. 220 (1886). Yick Wo involved an ordinance facially attacked as permitting arbitrary and capricious action in violation of the Due Process Clause.\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003e\"In the present cases we are not obliged to reason from the probable to the actual, and pass upon the validity of the ordinances complained of, as tried merely by the opportunities which their terms afford, of unequal and unjust discrimination in their administration.\" 118 U.S. at 373, 6 S.Ct. at 1072.\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003eThe Court declined to rule on the due process issue because it was evident that the administration of the statute violated equal protection guarantees.\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003e\"For the cases present the ordinances in actual operation, and the facts shown establish an administration directed against a particular class . . . .\" 118 U.S. at 373, 6 S.Ct. at 1073.\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003eYick Wo does not compel us to predict that the Commission will act in an arbitrary and capricious manner. Since the statute has not been applied nor is there evidence that it was designed to discriminate against a particular class, plaintiffs' claim is without merit.\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003e45. In instances where plaintiffs' liability is vicarious, the damage finding of the arbitration board would not be res judicata in the reimbursement suit if the plaintiff had not been a party to the arbitration. See the discussion of procedural due process, supra.\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003e46. See the discussion of the rights of mill owners in Bean v. Central Maine Power Co., 133 Me. 9, 11-14, 173 A. 498, 498-500 (1934).\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003e47. 1 Maine Laws 24 (1821).\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003e48. The Maine Legislature did, however, enact P.L. 1821, Ch. 45 § 4, which provided for \"a jury of twelve good and lawful men\" to determine yearly flowage damages and precluded any common law actions to recover such damages.\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003e49. At page 68 of his treatise, Professor Davis states, \"The danger is not blended power. The danger is unchecked power.\" Assuming this view, the \"incident to agency function\" rationale for quasi-judicial administrative acts, so often relied upon by the courts becomes unnecessary. If the sole, practical role of the separation of powers doctrine is to provide a check against one branch of government usurping all governmental powers, it is sufficient protection for the judiciary to have the power to review determinations of quasi-judicial bodies.\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003e50. We note that plaintiffs continually characterize the Commission as the body making the determination of damages. This is a misstatement. The board of arbitrators is selected, equally, by the Commission and the person determined to have caused the spill. Section 551(3). Strictly speaking then, the tribunal is not an administrative agency. The board of arbitrators, although selected by the parties, is analogous to the board of Commissioners, appointed by the Court, under the Mill Act. For purposes of the separation of powers doctrine it seems immaterial whether the fact finder is appointed by the Court pursuant to the statutory directive of the Mill Act (admitted by plaintiffs to be unobjectionable to Article III), or whether the fact finder is jointly selected by the parties pursuant to a statutory directive of the Coastal Conveyance Act.\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003e51. Pipe Line also claims immunity from the payment of duties under 19 U.S.C. § 1553 which states in pertinent part:\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003e\"Any merchandise . . . shown . . . to be destined to a foreign country, may be entered for transportation in bond through the United States by a bonded carrier without appraisement or the payment of duties . . . .\"\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003e52. Even if the oil offloaded at the Pipe Line's pier has ceased to be an import, it has at that time been introduced into the export process, i.e., delivered to a common carrier to be shipped outside the United States. Richfield Oil Corp. v. State Board of Equalization, 329 U.S. 69, 67 S.Ct. 156, 91 L.Ed. 80 (1946). As an export it is free from impost or duty levied by either the State or Congress.\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003e53. That clause provides:\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003e\"No tax or duty shall be laid on Articles exported from any State.\"\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003eThe prohibition is directed against the federal government but inasmuch as it is an absolute prohibition and concerns exports, it is similar to the limitation placed upon the States by Article I, Section 10, Clause 2. The cases construing \"on\" exports under Article I, Section 9, Clause 5, are applicable when construing that term under Article I, Section 10, Clause 2, Richfield Oil Corp. v.

That statute prohibits the appraisement or the imposition of duties upon bonded goods brought into the United States solely for export. The statute does not by its terms nor has it been construed to prevent a state from taxing activities related to the transhipment of such goods.\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003e56. The fee was attacked as a \"duty\" prohibited by the so-called tonnage clause.

The grant of admiralty jurisdiction to the federal courts was not exclusive. A duality of admiralty jurisdiction was created by the Judiciary Act of 1789. (Now 28 U.S.C. § 1933.)
