    "body": "OPINION OF THE COURT\n\nI. Preliminary Statement\n\nThis case challenges an act of Congress that makes the use offiltering software by public libraries a condition of thereceipt of federal funding. The Internet, as is well known, is avast, interactive medium based on a decentralized network ofcomputers around the world. Its most familiar feature is theWorld Wide Web (the \"Web\"), a network of computers known asservers that provide content to users. The Internet provideseasy access to anyone who wishes to provide or distributeinformation to a worldwide audience; it is used by more than 143million Americans. Indeed, much of the world's knowledgeaccumulated over centuries is available to Internet users almostinstantly. Approximately 10% of the Americans who use theInternet access it at public libraries. And approximately 95% ofall public libraries in the United States provide public accessto the Internet.\n\nWhile the beneficial effect of the Internet in expanding theamount of information available to its users is self-evident,its low entry barriers have also led to a perverse result —facilitation of the widespread dissemination of hardcorepornography within the easy reach not only of adultswho have every right to access it (so long as it is not legallyobscene or child pornography), but also of children andadolescents to whom it may be quite harmful. The volume ofpornography on the Internet is huge, and the record before usdemonstrates that public library patrons of all ages, many fromages 11 to 15, have regularly sought to access it in publiclibrary settings. There are more than 100,000 pornographic Websites that can be accessed for free and without providing anyregistration information, and tens of thousands of Web sitescontain child pornography.\n\nLibraries have reacted to this situation by utilizing a numberof means designed to insure that patrons avoid illegal (andunwanted) content while also enabling patrons to find thecontent they desire. Some libraries have trained patrons in howto use the Internet while avoiding illegal content, or havedirected their patrons to \"preferred\" Web sites that librarianshave reviewed. Other libraries have utilized such devices asrecessing the computer monitors, installing privacy screens, andmonitoring implemented by a \"tap on the shoulder\" of patronsperceived to be offending library policy. Still others, viewingthe foregoing approaches as inadequate or uncomfortable (somelibrarians do not wish to confront patrons), have purchasedcommercially available software that blocks certain categoriesof material deemed by the library board as unsuitable for use intheir facilities. Indeed, 7% of American public libraries useblocking software for adults. Although such programs aresomewhat effective in blocking large quantities of pornography,they are blunt instruments that not only \"underblock,\" i.e.,fail to block access to substantial amounts of content that thelibrary boards wish to exclude, but also, central to thislitigation, \"overblock,\" i.e., block access to large quantitiesof material that library boards do not wish to exclude and thatis constitutionally protected.\n\nMost of the libraries that use filtering software seek toblock sexually explicit speech. While most libraries include intheir physical collection copies of volumes such as The Joy ofSex and The Joy of Gay Sex, which contain quite explicitphotographs and descriptions, filtering software blocks largequantities of other, comparable information about health andsexuality that adults and teenagers seek on the Web. Oneteenager testified that the Internet access in a public librarywas the only venue in which she could obtain informationimportant to her about her own sexuality. Another library patronwitness described using the Internet to research breast cancerand reconstructive surgery for his mother who had breastsurgery. Even though some filtering programs contain exceptionsfor health and education, the exceptions do not solve theproblem of overblocking constitutionally protected material.Moreover, as we explain below, the filtering software on whichthe parties presented evidence in this case overblocks not onlyinformation relating to health and sexuality that might bemistaken for pornography or erotica, but also vast numbers ofWeb pages and sites that could not even arguably be construed asharmful or inappropriate for adults or minors.\n\nThe Congress, sharing the concerns of many library boards,enacted the Children's Internet Protection Act (\"CIPA\"), Pub.L.No. 106-554, which makes the use of filters by a public librarya condition of its receipt of two kinds of subsidies that areimportant (or even critical) to the budgets of many publiclibraries — grants under the Library Services and TechnologyAct, 20 U.S.C. § 9101 et seq. (\"LSTA\"), and so-called \"E-ratediscounts\" for Internet access and support under theTelecommunications Act, 47 U.S.C. § 254. LSTAgrant funds are awarded, inter alia, in order to: (1) assistlibraries in accessing information through electronic networks,and (2) provide targeted library and information services topersons having difficulty using a library and to underserved andrural communities, including children from families with incomesbelow the poverty line. E-rate discounts serve the similarpurpose of extending Internet access to schools and libraries inlow-income communities. CIPA requires that libraries, in orderto receive LSTA funds or E-rate discounts, certify that they areusing a \"technology protection measure\" that prevents patronsfrom accessing \"visual depictions\" that are \"obscene,\" \"childpornography,\" or in the case of minors, \"harmful to minors.\"20 U.S.C. § 9134(f)(1)(A) (LSTA); 47 U.S.C. § 254(h)(6)(B) \u0026 (C)(E-rate).\n\nThe plaintiffs, a group of libraries, library associations,library patrons, and Web site publishers, brought this suitagainst the United States and others alleging that CIPA isfacially unconstitutional because: (1) it induces publiclibraries to violate their patrons' First Amendment rightscontrary to the requirements of South Dakota v. Dole,483 U.S. 203, 107 S.Ct. 2793, 97 L.Ed.2d 171 (1987); and (2) it requireslibraries to relinquish their First Amendment rights as acondition on the receipt of federal funds and is thereforeimpermissible under the doctrine of unconstitutional conditions.In arguing that CIPA will induce public libraries to violate theFirst Amendment, the plaintiffs contend that given the limits ofthe filtering technology, CIPA's conditions effectively requirelibraries to impose contentbased restrictions on their patrons'access to constitutionally protected speech. According to theplaintiffs, these contentbased restrictions are subject tostrict scrutiny under public forum doctrine, see Rosenberger v.Rector \u0026 Visitors of Univ. of Va., 515 U.S. 819, 837, 115 S.Ct.2510, 132 L.Ed.2d 700 (1995), and are therefore permissible onlyif they are narrowly tailored to further a compelling stateinterest and no less restrictive alternatives would further thatinterest, see Reno v. ACLU, 521 U.S. 844, 874, 117 S.Ct. 2329,138 L.Ed.2d 874 (1997).\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e1\u003c/span\u003e The government responds that CIPAwill not induce public libraries to violate the First Amendment,since it is possible for at least some public libraries toconstitutionally comply with CIPA's conditions. Even if somelibraries' use of filters might violate the First Amendment, thegovernment submits that CIPA can be facially invalidated only ifit is impossible for any public library to comply with itsconditions without violating the First Amendment.\n\nPursuant to CIPA, a three-judge Court was convened to try theissues. Pub.L. No. 106-554. Following an intensive period ofdiscovery on an expedited scheduleto allow public libraries to know whether they need to certifycompliance with CIPA by July 1, 2002, to receive subsidies forthe upcoming year, the Court conducted an eight-day trial atwhich we heard 20 witnesses, and received numerous depositions,stipulations and documents. The principal focus of the trial wason the capacity of currently available filtering software. Theplaintiffs adduced substantial evidence not only that filteringprograms bar access to a substantial amount of speech on theInternet that is clearly constitutionally protected for adultsand minors, but also that these programs are intrinsicallyunable to block only illegal Internet content whilesimultaneously allowing access to all protected speech.\n\nAs our extensive findings of fact reflect, the plaintiffsdemonstrated that thousands of Web pages containing protectedspeech are wrongly blocked by the four leading filteringprograms, and these pages represent only a fraction of Web pageswrongly blocked by the programs. The plaintiffs' evidenceexplained that the problems faced by the manufacturers andvendors of filtering software are legion. The Web is extremelydynamic, with an estimated 1.5 million new pages added every dayand the contents of existing Web pages changing very rapidly.The category lists maintained by the blocking programs areconsidered to be proprietary information, and hence areunavailable to customers or the general public for review, sothat public libraries that select categories when implementingfiltering software do not really know what they are blocking.\n\nThere are many reasons why filtering software suffers fromextensive over- and underblocking, which we will explain belowin great detail. They center on the limitations on filteringcompanies' ability to: (1) accurately collect Web pages thatpotentially fall into a blocked category (e.g., pornography);(2) review and categorize Web pages that they have collected;and (3) engage in regular re-review of Web pages that they havepreviously reviewed. These failures spring from constraints onthe technology of automated classification systems, and thelimitations inherent in human review, including error,misjudgment, and scarce resources, which we describe in detailinfra at 58-74. One failure of critical importance is that theautomated systems that filtering companies use to collect Webpages for classification are able to search only text, notimages. This is crippling to filtering companies' ability tocollect pages containing \"visual depictions\" that are obscene,child pornography, or harmful to minors, as CIPA requires. Aswill appear, we find that it is currently impossible, given theInternet's size, rate of growth, rate of change, andarchitecture, and given the state of the art of automatedclassification systems, to develop a filter that neitherunderblocks nor overblocks a substantial amount of speech.\n\nThe government, while acknowledging that the filteringsoftware is imperfect, maintains that it is nonetheless quiteeffective, and that it successfully blocks the vast majority ofthe Web pages that meet filtering companies' categorydefinitions (e.g., pornography). The government contends that nomore is required. In its view, so long as the filtering softwareselected by the libraries screens out the bulk of the Web pagesproscribed by CIPA, the libraries have made a reasonable choicewhich suffices, under the applicable legal principles, to passconstitutional muster in the context of a facial challenge.Central to the government's position is the analogy it advancesbetween Internet filtering and the initial decision of a libraryto determine which materials to purchase for its printcollection. Public libraries have finite budgets and must makechoices as to whether to purchase, for example, bookson gardening or books on golf. Such content-based decisions,even the plaintiffs concede, are subject to rational basisreview and not a stricter form of First Amendment scrutiny. Inthe government's view, the fact that the Internet reverses theacquisition process and requires the libraries to, in effect,purchase the entire Internet, some of which (e.g., hardcorepornography) it does not want, should not mean that it ischargeable with censorship when it filters out offendingmaterial.\n\nThe legal context in which this extensive factual record isset is complex, implicating a number of constitutionaldoctrines, including the constitutional limitations onCongress's spending clause power, the unconstitutionalconditions doctrine, and subsidiary to these issues, the FirstAmendment doctrines of prior restraint, vagueness, andoverbreadth. There are a number of potential entry points intothe analysis, but the most logical is the spending clausejurisprudence in which the seminal case is South Dakota v.Dole, 483 U.S. 203, 107 S.Ct. 2793, 97 L.Ed.2d 171 (1987).Dole outlines four categories of constraints on Congress'sexercise of its power under the Spending Clause, but the onlyDole condition disputed here is the fourth and last, i.e.,whether CIPA requires libraries that receive LSTA funds orE-rate discounts to violate the constitutional rights of theirpatrons. As will appear, the question is not a simple one, andturns on the level of scrutiny applicable to a public library'scontent-based restrictions on patrons' Internet access. Whethersuch restrictions are subject to strict scrutiny, as plaintiffscontend, or only rational basis review, as the governmentcontends, depends on public forum doctrine.\n\nThe government argues that, in providing Internet access,public libraries do not create a public forum, since publiclibraries may reserve the right to exclude certain speakers fromavailing themselves of the forum. Accordingly, the governmentcontends that public libraries' restrictions on patrons'Internet access are subject only to rational basis review.\n\nPlaintiffs respond that the government's ability to restrictspeech on its own property, as in the case of restrictions onInternet access in public libraries, is not unlimited, and thatthe more widely the state facilitates the dissemination ofprivate speech in a given forum, the more vulnerable the state'sdecision is to restrict access to speech in that forum. We agreewith the plaintiffs that public libraries' contentbasedrestrictions on their patrons' Internet access are subject tostrict scrutiny. In providing even filtered Internet access,public libraries create a public forum open to any speakeraround the world to communicate with library patrons via theInternet on a virtually unlimited number of topics. Where thestate provides access to a \"vast democratic forum[],\" Reno v.ACLU, 521 U.S. 844, 868, 117 S.Ct. 2329, 138 L.Ed.2d 874(1997), open to any member of the public to speak on subjects\"as diverse as human thought,\" id. at 870, 117 S.Ct. 2329(internal quotation marks and citation omitted), the state'sdecision selectively to exclude from the forum speech whosecontent the state disfavors is subject to strict scrutiny, assuch exclusions risk distorting the marketplace of ideas thatthe state has facilitated. Application of strict scrutiny findsfurther support in the extent to which public libraries'provision of Internet access uniquely promotes First Amendmentvalues in a manner analogous to traditional public fora such asstreets, sidewalks, and parks, in which content-basedrestrictions are always subject to strict scrutiny.\n\nUnder strict scrutiny, a public library's use of filteringsoftware is permissible only if it is narrowly tailored tofurther a compelling government interest and no less restrictivealternative would serve that interest. We acknowledge that useof filtering software furthers public libraries' legitimateinterests in preventing patrons from accessing visual depictionsof obscenity, child pornography, or in the case of minors,material harmful to minors. Moreover, use of filters also helpsprevent patrons from being unwillingly exposed to patentlyoffensive, sexually explicit content on the Internet.\n\nWe are sympathetic to the position of the government,believing that it would be desirable if there were a means toensure that public library patrons could share in theinformational bonanza of the Internet while being insulated frommaterials that meet CIPA's definitions, that is, visualdepictions that are obscene, child pornography, or in the caseof minors, harmful to minors. Unfortunately this outcome,devoutly to be wished, is not available in this less than bestof all possible worlds. No category definition used by theblocking programs is identical to the legal definitions ofobscenity, child pornography, or material harmful to minors,and, at all events, filtering programs fail to block access to asubstantial amount of content on the Internet that falls intothe categories defined by CIPA. As will appear, we credit thetestimony of plaintiffs' expert Dr. Geoffrey Nunberg that theblocking software is (at least for the foreseeable future)incapable of effectively blocking the majority of materials inthe categories defined by CIPA without overblocking asubstantial amount of materials. Nunberg's analysis wassupported by extensive record evidence. As noted above, thisinability to prevent both substantial amounts of underblockingand overblocking stems from several sources, including,limitations on the technology that software filtering companiesuse to gather and review Web pages, limitations on resources forhuman review of Web pages, and the necessary error that resultsfrom human review processes.\n\nBecause the filtering software mandated by CIPA will blockaccess to substantial amounts of constitutionally protectedspeech whose suppression serves no legitimate governmentinterest, we are persuaded that a public library's use ofsoftware filters is not narrowly tailored to further any ofthese interests. Moreover, less restrictive alternatives existthat further the government's legitimate interest in preventingthe dissemination of obscenity, child pornography, and materialharmful to minors, and in preventing patrons from beingunwillingly exposed to patently offensive, sexually explicitcontent. To prevent patrons from accessing visual depictionsthat are obscene and child pornography, public libraries mayenforce Internet use policies that make clear to patrons thatthe library's Internet terminals may not be used to accessillegal speech. Libraries may then impose penalties on patronswho violate these policies, ranging from a warning tonotification of law enforcement, in the appropriate case. Lessrestrictive alternatives to filtering that further libraries'interest in preventing minors from exposure to visual depictionsthat are harmful to minors include requiring parental consent toor presence during unfiltered access, or restricting minors'unfiltered access to terminals within view of library staff.Finally, optional filtering, privacy screens, recessed monitors,and placement of unfiltered Internet terminals outside ofsight-lines provide less restrictive alternatives for librariesto prevent patrons from being unwillingly exposed to sexuallyexplicit content on the Internet.\n\nIn an effort to avoid the potentially fatal legal implicationsof the overblocking problem, the government falls back on theability of the libraries, under CIPA's disabling provisions,see CIPA § 1712 (codified at 20 U.S.C. § 9134(f)(3)), CIPA §1721(b) (codified at 47 U.S.C. § 254(h)(6)(D)), to unblock asite that is patently proper yet improperly blocked. Theevidence reflects that libraries can and do unblock the filterswhen a patron so requests. But it also reflects that requiringlibrary patrons to ask for a Web site to be unblocked will determany patrons because they are embarrassed, or desire to protecttheir privacy or remain anonymous. Moreover, the unblocking maytake days, and may be unavailable, especially in branchlibraries, which are often less well staffed than mainlibraries. Accordingly, CIPA's disabling provisions do not curethe constitutional deficiencies in public libraries' use ofInternet filters.\n\nUnder these circumstances we are constrained to conclude thatthe library plaintiffs must prevail in their contention thatCIPA requires them to violate the First Amendment rights oftheir patrons, and accordingly is facially invalid, even underthe standard urged on us by the government, which would permitus to facially invalidate CIPA only if it is impossible for asingle public library to comply with CIPA's conditions withoutviolating the First Amendment. In view of the limitationsinherent in the filtering technology mandated by CIPA, anypublic library that adheres to CIPA's conditions willnecessarily restrict patrons' access to a substantial amount ofprotected speech, in violation of the First Amendment. Giventhis conclusion, we need not reach plaintiffs' arguments thatCIPA effects a prior restraint on speech and isunconstitutionally vague. Nor do we decide their cognateunconstitutional conditions theory, though for reasons explainedinfra at note 36, we discuss the issues raised by that claimat some length.\n\nFor these reasons, we will enter an Order declaring Sections1712(a)(2) and 1721(b) of the Children's Internet ProtectionAct, codified at 20 U.S.C. § 9134(f) and 47 U.S.C. § 254(h)(6),respectively, to be facially invalid under the First Amendmentand permanently enjoining the defendants from enforcing thoseprovisions.\n\nII. Findings of Fact\n\nA. Statutory Framework\n\n1. Nature and Operation of the E-rate and LSTA Programs\n\nIn the Telecommunications Act of 1996 (\"1996 Act\"), Congressdirected the Federal Communications Commission (\"FCC\") to takethe steps necessary to establish a system of support mechanismsto ensure the delivery of affordable telecommunications serviceto all Americans. This system, referred to as \"universalservice,\" is codified in section 254 of the Communications Actof 1934, as amended by the 1996 Act. See 47 U.S.C. § 254.Congress specified several groups as beneficiaries of theuniversal service support mechanism, including consumers inhigh-cost areas, low-income consumers, schools and libraries,and rural health care providers. See 47 U.S.C. § 254(h)(1).The extension of universal service to schools and libraries insection 254(h) is commonly referred to as the Schools andLibraries Program, or \"Erate\" Program.\n\nUnder the E-rate Program, \"[a]ll telecommunications carriersserving a geographic area shall, upon a bona fide request forany of its services that are within the definition of universalservice . . ., provide such services to elementary schools,secondary schools, and libraries for educational purposes atrates less than the amounts charged for similar services toother parties.\" 47 U.S.C. § 254(h)(1)(B). Under FCC regulations,providers of \"interstate telecommunications\" (with certainexceptions, see 47 C.F.R. § 54.706(d)), must contribute aportion of their revenue for disbursement among eligiblecarriers that are providing services to those groups or areasspecified by Congress in section 254. To be eligible for thediscounts, a library must: (1) be eligible for assistance from aState library administrative agency under the Library Servicesand Technology Act, see infra; (2) be funded as an independententity, completely separate from any schools; and (3) not beoperating as a for-profit business. See 47 C.F.R. § 54.501(c).Discounts on services for eligible libraries are set as apercentage of the pre-discount price, and range from 20% to 90%,depending on a library's level of economic disadvantage and itslocation in an urban or rural area. See 47 C.F.R. § 54.505.Currently, a library's level of economic disadvantage is basedon the percentage of students eligible for the national schoollunch program in the school district in which the library islocated.\n\nThe Library Services and Technology Act (\"LSTA\"), SubchapterII of the Museum and Library Services Act, 20 U.S.C. § 9101 etseq., was enacted by Congress in 1996 as part of the OmnibusConsolidated Appropriations Act of 1997, Pub.L. No. 104-208. TheLSTA establishes three grant programs to achieve the goal ofimproving library services across the nation. Under the Grantsto States Program, LSTA grant funds are awarded, inter alia,in order to assist libraries in accessing information throughelectronic networks and pay for the costs of acquiring orsharing computer systems and telecommunications technologies.See 20 U.S.C. § 9141(a). Through the Grants to States program,LSTA funds have been used to acquire and pay costs associatedwith Internet-accessible computers located in libraries.\n\n2. CIPA\n\nThe Children's Internet Protection Act (\"CIPA\") was enacted aspart of the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2001, whichconsolidated and enacted several appropriations bills, includingthe Miscellaneous Appropriations Act, of which CIPA was a part.See Pub.L. No. 106-554. CIPA addresses three distinct types offederal funding programs: (1) aid to elementary and secondaryschools pursuant to Title III of the Elementary and SecondaryEducation Act of 1965, see CIPA § 1711 (amending Title 20 toadd § 3601); (2) LSTA grants to states for support of libraries,see CIPA § 1712 (amending the Museum and Library Services Act,20 U.S.C. § 9134); and (3) discounts under the E-rate program,see CIPA § 1721(a) \u0026 (b) (both amending the Communications Actof 1934, 47 U.S.C. § 254(h)). Only sections 1712 and 1721(b) ofCIPA, which apply to libraries, are at issue in this case.\n\nAs explained in more detail below, CIPA requires librariesthat participate in the LSTA and E-rate programs to certify thatthey are using software filters on their computers to protectagainst visual depictions that are obscene, child pornography,or in the case of minors, harmful to minors. CIPA permitslibrary officials to disable the filters for patrons for bonafide research or other lawful purposes, but disabling is notpermitted for minor patrons if the library receives E-ratediscounts.\n\na. CIPA's Amendments to the E-rate Program\n\nSection 1721(b) of CIPA imposes conditions on a library'sparticipation in the Erate program. A library \"having one ormore computers with Internet access may not receive services atdiscount rates,\" CIPA § 1721(b) (codified at47 U.S.C. § 254(h)(6)(A)(i)), unless the librarycertifies that it is \"enforcing a policy of Internet safety thatincludes the operation of a technology protection measure withrespect to any of its computers with Internet access thatprotects against access through such computers to visualdepictions that are — (I) obscene; (II) child pornography; or(III) harmful to minors,\" and that it is \"enforcing theoperation of such technology protection measure during any useof such computers by minors.\" CIPA § 1721(b) (codified at47 U.S.C. § 254(h)(6)(B)).\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e2\u003c/span\u003e CIPA defines a \"technologyprotection measure\" as \"a specific technology that blocks orfilters access to visual depictions that are obscene, . . .child pornography, . . . or harmful to minors.\" CIPA §1703(b)(1) (codified at 47 U.S.C. § 254(h)(7)(I)).\n\nTo receive E-rate discounts, a library must also certify thatfiltering software is in operation during adult use of theInternet. More specifically, with respect to adults, a librarymust certify that it is \"enforcing a policy of Internet safetythat includes the operation of a technology protection measurewith respect to any of its computers with Internet access thatprotects against access through such computers to visualdepictions that are — (I) obscene; or (II) child pornography,\"and that it is \"enforcing the operation of such technologyprotection measure during any use of such computers.\" CIPA §1721(b) (codified at 47 U.S.C. § 254(h)(6)(C)). Interpreting thestatutory terms \"any use,\" the FCC has concluded that \"CIPAmakes no distinction between computers used only by staff andthose accessible to the public.\" In re Federal State JointBoard on Universal Service: Children's Internet Protection Act,CC Docket No. 96-45, Report and Order, FCC 01-120, ¶ 30 (Apr. 5,2001).\n\nWith respect to libraries receiving Erate discounts, CIPAfurther specifies that \"[a]n administrator, supervisor, or otherperson authorized by the certifying authority . . . may disablethe technology protection measure concerned, during use by anadult, to enable access for bona fide research or other lawfulpurpose.\" CIPA § 1721(b) (codified at 47 U.S.C. § 254(h)(6)(D)).\n\nb. CIPA's Amendments to the LSTA Program\n\nSection 1712 of CIPA amends the Museum and Library ServicesAct (20 U.S.C.§ 9134(f)) to provide that no funds made available under the Act\"may be used to purchase computers used to access the Internet,or to pay for direct costs associated with accessing theInternet,\" unless such library \"has in place\" and is enforcing\"a policy of Internet safety that includes the operation of atechnology protection measure with respect to any of itscomputers with Internet access that protects against accessthrough such computers to visual depictions\" that are \"obscene\"or \"child pornography,\" and, when the computers are in use byminors, also protects against access to visual depictions thatare \"harmful to minors.\" CIPA § 1712 (codified at20 U.S.C. § 9134(f)(1)). Section 1712 contains definitions of \"technologyprotection measure,\" \"obscene,\" \"child pornography,\" and\"harmful to minors,\" that are substantially similar to thosefound in the provisions governing the E-rate program. CIPA §1712 (codified at 20 U.S.C. § 9134(f)(7)); see also supra note2.\n\nAs under the E-rate program, \"an administrator, supervisor orother authority may disable a technology protection measure. . . to enable access for bona fide research or other lawfulpurposes.\" CIPA § 1712 (codified at 20 U.S.C. § 9134(f)(3)).Whereas CIPA's amendments to the Erate program permit disablingfor bona fide research or other lawful purposes only duringadult use, the LSTA provision permits disabling for both adultsand minors.\n\nB. Identity of the Plaintiffs\n\n1. Library and Library Association Plaintiffs\n\nPlaintiffs American Library Association, Alaska LibraryAssociation, California Library Association, Connecticut LibraryAssociation, Freedom to Read Foundation, Maine LibraryAssociation, New England Library Association, New York LibraryAssociation, and Wisconsin Library Association are non-profitorganizations whose members include public libraries thatreceive either E-rate discounts or LSTA funds for the provisionof Internet access. Because it is a prerequisite toassociational standing, we note that the interests that theseorganizations seek to protect in this litigation are central totheir raison d'être.\n\nPlaintiffs Fort Vancouver Regional Library District, insouthwest Washington state; Multnomah County Public Library, inMultnomah County, Oregon; Norfolk Public Library System, inNorfolk, Virginia; Santa Cruz Public Library Joint PowersAuthority, in Santa Cruz, California; South Central LibrarySystem (\"SCLS\"), centered in Madison, Wisconsin; and theWestchester Library System, in Westchester County, New York, arepublic library systems with branch offices in their respectivelocalities that provide Internet access to their patrons.\n\nThe Fort Vancouver Regional Library District, for over threeyears from 1999-2001, received $135,000 in LSTA grants and$19,500 in E-rate discounts for Internet access. The MultnomahCounty Public Library received $70,000 in E-rate discounts forInternet access this year, and has applied for $100,000 inE-rate discounts for the upcoming year. The Norfolk PublicLibrary System received $90,000 in E-rate discounts for Internetaccess this year, and has received a $200,000 LSTA grant to putcomputer labs in eight of its libraries. The Santa Cruz PublicLibrary Joint Powers Authority received $20,560 in E-ratediscounts for Internet access in 2001-02. The SCLS receivedbetween $3,000 and $5,000 this year in E-rate discounts forInternet access.\n\nThe Fort Vancouver Regional Library District Board is a publicboard whose members are appointed by elected countycommissioners. The Multnomah County Library is a countydepartment, whoseboard is appointed by the county chair and confirmed by theother commissioners. The SCLS is an aggregation of 51independently governed statutory member public libraries, whoserelationship to SCLS is defined by state law. The governing bodyof the SCLS is the Library Board of Trustees, which consists of20 members nominated by county executives and ratified by countyboards of supervisors.\n\n2. Patron and Patron Association Plaintiffs\n\nPlaintiffs Association of Community Organizations for ReformNow, Friends of the Philadelphia City Institute Library, and thePennsylvania Alliance for Democracy are nonprofit organizationswhose members include individuals who access the Internet atpublic libraries that receive E-rate discounts or LSTA funds forthe provision of public Internet access. We note for the purposeof associational standing that the interests that theseorganizations seek to protect in this litigation are germane totheir purposes.\n\nPlaintiffs Emmalyn Rood, Mark Brown, Elizabeth Hrenda, C.Donald Weinberg, Sherron Dixon, by her father and next friendGordon Dixon, James Geringer, Marnique Tynesha Overby, by hernext friend Carolyn C. Williams, William J. Rosenbaum, CarolynC. Williams, and Quiana Williams, by her mother and next friendSharon Bernard, are adults and minors who use the Internet atpublic libraries that, to the best of their knowledge, do notfilter patrons' access to the Internet. Several of theseplaintiffs do not have Internet access from home.\n\nEmmalyn Rood is a sixteen-year-old who uses the MultnomahCounty Public Library. When she was 13, she used the Internet atthe Multnomah County Public Library to research issues relatingto her sexual identity. Ms. Rood did not use her home or schoolcomputer for this research, in part because she wished hersearching to be private.

Background\n\nAs we noted at the outset, the Internet is a vast, interactivemedium consisting of a decentralized network of computers aroundthe world. The Internet presents low entry barriers to anyonewho wishes to provide or distribute information. Unliketelevision, cable, radio, newspapers, magazines or books, theInternet provides an opportunity for those with access to it tocommunicate with a worldwide audience at little cost. At least400 million people use the Internet worldwide, and approximately143 million Americans were using the Internet as of September2001. Nat'l Telecomm. \u0026 Info. Admin., A Nation Online: HowAmericans Are Expanding Their Use of the Internet (February2002), available at http://www.ntia.doc.gov/ntia-home/dn/.\n\nThe World Wide Web is a part of the Internet that consists ofa network of computers, called \"Web servers,\" that host \"pages\"of content accessible via the Hypertext Transfer Protocol or\"HTTP.\" Anyone with a computer connected to the Internet cansearch for and retrieve information stored on Web serverslocated around the world. Computer users typically access theWeb by running a program called a \"browser\" on their computers.The browser displays, as individual pages on the computerscreen, the various types of content found on the Web and letsthe user follow the connections built into Web pages — called\"hypertext links,\" \"hyperlinks,\" or \"links\" — to additionalcontent. Two popular browsers are Microsoft Internet Explorerand Netscape Navigator.\n\nA \"Web page\" is one or more files a browser graphicallyassembles to make a viewable whole when a user requests contentover the Internet. A Web page may contain a variety of differentelements, including text, images, buttons, form fields that theuser can fill in, and links to other Web pages. A \"Web site\" isa term that can be used in several different ways. It may referto all of the pages and resources available on a particular Webserver. It may also refer to all the pages and resourcesassociated with a particular organization, company or person,even if these are located on different servers, or in asubdirectory on a single server shared with other, unrelatedsites. Typically, a Web site has as an intended point of entry,a \"home page,\" which includes links to other pages on the sameWeb site or to pages on other sites. Online discussion groupsand chat rooms relating to a variety of subjects are availablethrough many Web sites.\n\nUsers may find content on the Web using engines that searchfor requested keywords. In response to a keyword request, asearch engine will display a list of Web sites that may containrelevant content and provide links to those sites. Searchengines and directories often return a limited number of sitesin their search results (e.g., the Google search engine willreturn only 2,000 sites in response to a search, even if it hasfound, for example, 530,000 sites in its index that meet thesearch criteria).\n\nA user may also access content on the Web by typing a URL(Uniform Resource Locator) into the address line of the browser.A URL is an address that points to some resource located on aWeb server that is accessible over the Internet. This resourcemay be a Web site, a Web page, an image, a sound or video file,or other resource. A URL can be either a numeric InternetProtocol or \"IP\" address, or an alphanumeric \"domain name\"address. Every Web server connected to the Internet is assignedan IP address. A typical IP address looks like \"13.1.64.14.\"Typing the URL \"http://13.1.64.14/\" into a browser will bringthe user to the Web server that corresponds to that address. Forconvenience, most Web servers have alphanumeric domain nameaddresses in addition to IP addresses. For example, typing in\"http://www.paed.uscourts.gov\" will bring the user to the sameWeb server as typing in \"http://204.170.64.143.\"\n\nEvery time a user attempts to access material located on a Webserver by entering a domain name address into a Web browser, arequest is made to a Domain Name Server, which is a directory ofdomain names and IP addresses, to \"resolve,\" or translate, thedomain name address into an IP address. That IP address is thenused to locate the Web server from which content is beingrequested. A Web site may be accessed by using either its domainname address or its IP address.\n\nA domain name address typically consists of several parts. Forexample, the alphanumeric URLhttp://www.paed.uscourts.gov/documents/opinions can be brokendown into three parts. The first part is the transfer protocolthe computer will use in accessing the content (e.g., \"http\" forHypertext Transfer Protocol); next is the name of the hostserver on which the information is stored (e.g.,www.paed.uscourts.gov); and then the name of the particularfile or directory on that server (e.g., /documents/opinions).\n\nA single Web page may be associated with more than one URL.For example, the URLs http://www.newyorktimes.com andhttp://www.nytimes.com will both take the user to the NewYork Times home page. The topmost directory in a Web site isoften referred to as that Web site's root directory or root URL.For example, in http://www.paed.uscourts.gov/documents, theroot URL is http://www.paed.uscourts.gov. There may behundreds or thousands of pages under a single root URL, or theremay be one or only a few.\n\nThere are a number of Web hosting companies that maintain Websites for other businesses and individuals, which can lead tovast amounts of diverse content being located at the same IPaddress. Hosting services are offered either for a fee, or insome cases, for free, allowing any individual with Internetaccess to create a Web site. Some hosting services are providedthrough the process of \"IP-based hosting,\" where each domainname is assigned a unique IP number. For example,www.baseball.com might map to the IP address \"10.3.5.9\" andwww.XXX.com might map to the IP address \"10.0.42.5.\" Otherhosting services are provided through the process of \"name-basedhosting,\" where multiple domain name addresses are mapped to asingle IP address. If the hosting company were using thismethod, both www.baseball.com and www.XXX.com could map to asingle IP address, e.g., \"10.3.5.9.\" As a result of the\"name-based hosting\" process, up to tens of thousands of pageswith heterogeneous content may share a single IP address.\n\n2. The Indexable Web, the \"Deep Web\"; Their Size and Rates of Growth and Change\n\nThe universe of content on the Web that could be indexed, intheory, by standard search engines is known as the \"publiclyindexable Web.\" The publicly indexable Web is limited to thosepages that are accessible by following a link from another Webpage that is recognized by a search engine. This limitationexists because online indexing techniques used by popular searchengines and directories such as Yahoo, Lycos and AltaVista, arebased on \"spidering\" technology, which finds sites to index byfollowing links from site to site in a continuous search for newcontent. If a Web page or site is not linked by others, thenspidering will not discover that page or site.\n\nFurthermore, many larger Web sites contain instructions,through software, that prevent spiders from investigating thatsite, and therefore the contents of such sites also cannot beindexed using spidering technology. Because of the vast size anddecentralized structure of the Web, no search engine ordirectory indexes all of the content on the publicly indexableWeb. We credit current estimates that no more than 50% of thecontent currently on the publicly indexable Web has been indexedby all search engines and directories combined. No currentlyavailable method or combination of methods for collecting URLscan collect the addresses of all URLs on the Web.\n\nThe portion of the Web that is not theoretically indexablethrough the use of\"spidering\" technology, because other Web pages do not link toit, is called the \"Deep Web.\" Such sites or pages can still bemade publicly accessible without being made publicly indexableby, for example, using individual or mass emailings (also knownas \"spam\") to distribute the URL to potential readers orcustomers, or by using types of Web links that cannot be foundby spiders but can be seen and used by readers. \"Spamming\" is acommon method of distributing to potential customers links tosexually explicit content that is not indexable.\n\nBecause the Web is decentralized, it is impossible to sayexactly how large it is. A 2000 study estimated a total of 7.1million unique Web sites, which at the Web's historical rate ofgrowth, would have increased to 11 million unique sites as ofSeptember 2001. Estimates of the total number of Web pages vary,but a figure of 2 billion is a reasonable estimate of the numberof Web pages that can be reached, in theory, by standard searchengines. We need not make a specific finding as to a figure, forby any measure the Web is extremely vast, and it is constantlygrowing. The indexable Web is growing at a rate of approximately1.5 million pages per day. The size of the un-indexable Web, orthe \"Deep Web,\" while impossible to determine precisely, isestimated to be two to ten times that of the publicly indexableWeb.\n\nIn addition to growing rapidly, Web pages and sites areconstantly being removed, or changing their content. Web sitesor pages can change content without changing their domain nameaddresses or IP addresses. Individual Web pages have an averagelife span of approximately 90 days.\n\n3. The Amount of Sexually Explicit Material on the Web\n\nThere is a vast amount of sexually explicit material availablevia the Internet and the Web. Sexually explicit material on theInternet is easy to access using any public search engine, suchas, for example, Google or AltaVista. Although much of thesexually explicit material available on the Web is posted oncommercial sites that require viewers to pay in order to gainaccess to the site, a large number of sexually explicit sitesmay be accessed for free and without providing any registrationinformation. Most importantly, some Web sites that containsexually explicit content have innocuous domain names andtherefore can be reached accidentally. A commonly cited exampleis http://www.white-house.com. Other innocent-sounding URLsthat retrieve graphic, sexually explicit depictions includehttp://www.boys.com, http://www.girls.com,http://www.coffeebeansupply.com, andhttp://www.BookstoreUSA.com. Moreover, commercial Web sitesthat contain sexually explicit material often use a technique ofattaching pop-up windows to their sites, which open new windowsadvertising other sexually explicit sites without any promptingby the user. This technique makes it difficult for a userquickly to exit all of the pages containing sexually explicitmaterial, whether he or she initially accessed such materialintentionally or not.\n\nThe percentage of Web pages on the indexed Web containingsexually explicit content is relatively small. Recent estimatesindicate that no more than 1-2% of the content on the Web ispornographic or sexually explicit. However, the absolute numberof Web sites offering free sexually explicit material isextremely large, approximately 100,000 sites.\n\nD. American Public Libraries\n\nThe more than 9,000 public libraries in the United States aretypically funded (at least in large part) by state or localgovernments. They are frequently overseenby a board of directors that is either elected or is appointedby an elected official or a body of elected officials. We heardtestimony from librarians and library board members working ineight public library systems in different communities across thecountry, some of whom are also plaintiffs in this case. Theyhailed from the following library systems: Fort Vancouver,Washington; Fulton County, Indiana; Greenville, South Carolina;a regional consortium of libraries centered in Madison,Wisconsin; Multnomah County, Oregon; Norfolk, Virginia; Tacoma,Washington; and Westerville, Ohio. The parties also tookdepositions from several other librarians and library boardmembers who did not testify during the trial, and submitted anumber of other documents regarding individual libraries'policies.\n\n1. The Mission of Public Libraries, and Their Reference and Collection Development Practices\n\nAmerican public libraries operate in a wide variety ofcommunities, and it is not surprising that they do not all viewtheir mission identically. Nor are their practices uniform.Nevertheless, they generally share a common mission — to providepatrons with a wide range of information and ideas.\n\nPublic libraries across the country have endorsed the AmericanLibrary Association's (\"ALA\") \"Library Bill of Rights\" and/or\"Freedom to Read Statement;\" including every library testifyingon behalf of the defendants in this case. The \"Library Bill ofRights,\" first adopted by the ALA in 1948, provides, among otherthings, that \"[b]ooks and other library resources should beprovided for the interest, information, and enlightenment of allpeople of the community the library serves.\" It also states thatlibraries \"should provide materials and information presentingall points of view on current and historical issues\" and thatlibrary materials \"should not be proscribed or removed becauseof partisan or doctrinal disapproval.\"\n\nThe ALA's \"Freedom to Read\" statement, adopted in 1953 andmost recently updated in July 2000, states, among other things,that \"[i]t is in the public interest for publishers andlibrarians to make available the widest diversity of views andexpressions, including those that are unorthodox or unpopularwith the majority.\" It also states that \"[i]t is theresponsibility of . . . librarians . . . to contestencroachments upon th[e] freedom [to read] by individuals orgroups seeking to impose their own standards or tastes upon thecommunity at large.\"\n\nPublic libraries provide information not only for educationalpurposes, but also for recreational, professional, and otherpurposes. For example, Ginnie Cooper, Director of the MultnomahCounty Library, testified that some of the library's mostpopular items include video tapes of the British BroadcastingCorporation's \"Fawlty Towers\" series, and also print and \"bookson tape\" versions of science fiction, romance, and mysterynovels. Many public libraries include sexually explicitmaterials in their print collection, such as The Joy of Sexand The Joy of Gay Sex. Very few public libraries, however,collect more graphic sexually explicit materials, such asXXX-rated videos, or Hustler magazine.\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e4\u003c/span\u003e\n\nThe mission of public librarians is to provide their patronswith a wide array of information, and they surely do so.Reference librarians across America answer more than 7 millionquestions weekly. If a patron has a specialized need forinformation not available in the public library, theprofessional librarian will use a reference interview to findout what information is needed to help the user, including thepurpose for which an item will be used. Reference librarians aretrained to assist patrons without judging the patron's purposein seeking information, or the content of the information thatthe patron is seeking.\n\nMany public libraries routinely provide patrons with access tomaterials not in their collections through the use ofbibliographic access tools and interlibrary loan programs.Public libraries typically will assist patrons in obtainingaccess to all materials except those that are illegal, even ifthey do not collect those materials in their physicalcollection. In order to provide this access, a librarian mayattempt to find material not included in the library's owncollection in other libraries in the system, throughinterlibrary loan, or through a referral, perhaps to agovernment agency or a commercial bookstore. Interlibrary loanis expensive, however, and is therefore used infrequently.\n\nPublic librarians also apply professional standards to theircollection development practices. Public libraries generallymake material selection decisions and frame policies governingcollection development at the local level. Collectiondevelopment is a key subject in the curricula of Masters ofLibrary Science programs and is defined by certain practices. Ingeneral, professional standards guide public librarians tobuild, develop and create collections that have certaincharacteristics, such as balance in its coverage and requisiteand appropriate quality. To this end, the goal of librarycollections is not universal coverage, but rather to find thosematerials that would be of the greatest direct benefit orinterest to the community. In making selection decisions,librarians consider criteria including the content of thematerial, its accuracy, the title's niche in relation to therest of the collection, the authority of the author, thepublisher, the work's presentation, and how it compares withother material available in the same genre or on the samesubject.\n\nIn pursuing the goal of achieving a balanced collection thatserves the needs and interests of their patrons, librariansgenerally have a fair amount of autonomy, but may also be guidedby a library's collection development policy. These collectiondevelopment policies are often drawn up in conjunction with thelibraries' governing boards and with representatives from thecommunity, and may be the result of public hearings, discussionsand other input.\n\nAlthough many librarians use selection aids, such as reviewjournals and bibliographies, as a guide to the quality ofpotential acquisitions, they do not generally delegate theirselection decisions to parties outside of the public library orits governing body. One limited exception is the use ofthird-party vendors or approval plans to acquire print and videoresources. In such arrangements, third-party vendors providematerials based on the library's description of its collectiondevelopment criteria. The vendor sends materials to the library,and the library retains the materials that meet its collectiondevelopment needs and returns the materials that do not. Even inthis arrangement, however, the librarians still retain ultimatecontrol over their collection development and review all of thematerials that enter their library's collection.\n\n2. The Internet in Public Libraries\n\nThe vast majority of public libraries offer Internet access totheir patrons. According to a recent report by the U.S. NationalCommission on Libraries and Information Science, approximately95% of all public libraries provide public access to theInternet. John C. Bertot \u0026 Charles R. McClure, Public Librariesand the Internet 2000: Summary Findings and Data Tables, Reportto National Commission on Libraries and Information Science, at3. The Internet vastly expands the amount of informationavailable to patrons of public libraries. The widespreadavailability of Internet access in public libraries is due, inpart, to the availability of public funding, including state andlocal funding and the federal funding programs regulated byCIPA.\n\nMany libraries face a large amount of patron demand for theirInternet services. At some libraries, patron demand for Internetaccess during a given day exceeds the supply of computerterminals with access to the Internet. These libraries usesign-in and time limit procedures and/or establish rulesregarding the allowable uses of the terminals, in an effort toration their computer resources. For example, some of thelibraries whose librarians testified at trial prohibit the useof email and chat functions on their public Internet terminals.\n\nPublic libraries play an important role in providing Internetaccess to citizens who would not otherwise possess it. Of the143 million Americans using the Internet, approximately 10%, or14.3 million people, access the Internet at a public library.Internet access at public libraries is more often used by thosewith lower incomes than those with higher incomes. About 20.3%of Internet users with household family income of less than$15,000 per year use public libraries for Internet access.Approximately 70% of libraries serving communities with povertylevels in excess of 40% receive E-rate discounts.\n\na. Internet Use Policies in Public Libraries\n\nApproximately 95% of libraries with public Internet accesshave some form of \"acceptable use\" policy or \"Internet use\"policy governing patrons' use of the Internet. These policiesset forth the conditions under which patrons are permitted toaccess and use the library's Internet resources. These policiesvary widely. Some of the less restrictive policies, like thoseheld by Multnomah County Library and Fort Vancouver RegionalLibrary, do not prohibit adult patrons from viewing sexuallyexplicit materials on the Web, as long as they do so atterminals with privacy screens or recessed monitors, which aredesigned to prevent other patrons from seeing the material thatthey are viewing, and as long as it does not violate state orfederal law to do so. Other libraries prohibit their patronsfrom viewing all \"sexually explicit\" or \"sexually graphic\"materials.\n\nSome libraries prohibit the viewing of materials that are notnecessarily sexual, such as Web pages that are \"harmful tominors,\" \"offensive to the public,\" \"objectionable,\" \"raciallyoffensive,\" or simply \"inappropriate.\" Other libraries restrictaccess to Web sites that the library just does not want toprovide, even though the sites are not necessarily offensive.For example, the Fulton County Public Library restricts accessto the Web sites of dating services. Similarly, the TacomaPublic Library's policy does not allow patrons to use thelibrary's Internet terminals for personal email, for onlinechat, or for playing games.\n\nIn some cases, libraries instituted Internet use policiesafter having experiencedspecific problems, whereas in other cases, libraries developeddetailed Internet use policies and regulatory measures (such asusing filtering software) before ever offering public Internetaccess. Essentially four interests motivate libraries toinstitute Internet use policies and to apply the methodsdescribed above to regulate their patrons' use of the Internet.\n\nFirst, libraries have sought to protect patrons (especiallychildren) and staff members from accidentally viewing sexuallyexplicit images, or other Web pages containing content deemedharmful, that other patrons are viewing on the Internet. Forexample, some librarians who testified described situations inwhich patrons left sexually explicit images minimized on anInternet terminal so that the next patron would see them whenthey began using it, or in which patrons printed sexuallyexplicit images from a Web site and left them at a publicprinter.\n\nSecond, libraries have attempted to protect patrons fromunwittingly or accidentally accessing Web pages that they do notwish to see while they are using the Internet. For example, theMemphis Shelby County (Tennessee) Public Library's Internet usepolicy states that the library \"employs filtering technology toreduce the possibility that customers may encounterobjectionable content in the form of depictions of full nudityand sexual acts.\"\n\nThird, libraries have sought to keep patrons (again,especially children) from intentionally accessing sexuallyexplicit materials or other materials that the library deemsinappropriate. For example, a study of the Tacoma PublicLibrary's Internet use logs for the year 2000 showed that usersbetween the ages of 11 and 15 accounted for 41% of the filterblocks that occurred on library computers. The study, which wecredit, concluded that children and young teens were activelyseeking to access sexually explicit images in the library. TheGreenville Library's Board of Directors was particularlyconcerned that patrons were accessing obscene materials in thepublic library in violation of South Carolina's obscenitystatute.\n\nFinally, some libraries have regulated patrons' Internet useto attempt to control patrons' inappropriate (or illegal)behavior that is thought to stem from viewing Web pages thatcontain sexually explicit materials or content that is otherwisedeemed unacceptable.\n\nWe recognize the concerns that led several of the publiclibraries whose librarians and board members testified in thiscase to start using Internet filtering software. The testimonyof the Chairman of the Board of the Greenville Public Library isillustrative. In December 1999, there was considerable localpress coverage in Greenville concerning adult patrons whoroutinely used the library to surf the Web for pornography. Inresponse to public outcry stemming from the newspaper report,the Board of Trustees held a special board meeting to obtaininformation and to communicate with the public concerning thelibrary's provision of Internet access. At this meeting, theBoard learned for the first time of complaints about childrenbeing exposed to pornography that was displayed on the library'sInternet terminals.\n\nIn late January to early February of 2000, the libraryinstalled privacy screens and recessed terminals in an effort torestrict the display of sexually explicit Web sites at thelibrary. In February, 2000, the Board informed the library staffthat they were expected to be familiar with the South Carolinaobscenity statute and to enforce the policy prohibition onaccess to obscene materials, child pornography, or othermaterials prohibited under applicable local, state, and federallaws. Staffwere told that they were to enforce the policy by means of a\"tap on the shoulder.\" Prior to adopting its current InternetUse Policy, the Board adopted an \"Addendum to Current InternetUse Policy.\" Under the policy, the Board temporarily instituteda two-hour time limit per day for Internet use; reducedsubstantially the number of computers with Internet access inthe library; reconfigured the location of the computers so thatlibrarians had visual contact with all Internet-accessibleterminals; and removed the privacy screens from terminals withInternet access.\n\nEven after the Board implemented the privacy screens and laterthe \"tap-on-the-shoulder\" policy combined with placing terminalsin view of librarians, the library experienced a high turnoverrate among reference librarians who worked in view of Internetterminals. Finding that the policies that it had tried did notprevent the viewing of sexually explicit materials in thelibrary, the Board at one point considered discontinuingInternet access in the library. The Board finally concluded thatthe methods that it had used to regulate Internet use were notsufficient to stem the behavioral problems that it thought werelinked to the availability of pornographic materials in thelibrary. As a result, it implemented a mandatory filteringpolicy.\n\nWe note, however, that none of the libraries proffered by thedefendants presented any systematic records or quantitativecomparison of the amount of criminal or otherwise inappropriatebehavior that occurred in their libraries before they beganusing Internet filtering software compared to the amount thathappened after they installed the software. The plaintiffs'witnesses also testified that because public libraries arepublic places, incidents involving inappropriate behavior inlibraries (sexual and otherwise) existed long before librariesprovided access to the Internet.\n\nb. Methods for Regulating Internet Use\n\nThe methods that public libraries use to regulate Internet usevary greatly. They can be organized into four categories: (1)channeling patrons' Internet use; (2) separating patrons so thatthey will not see what other patrons are viewing; (3) placingInternet terminals in public view and having librarians observepatrons to make sure that they are complying with the library'sInternet use policy; and (4) using Internet filtering software.\n\nThe first category — channeling patrons' Internet use —frequently includes offering training to patrons on how to usethe Internet, including how to access the information that theywant and to avoid the materials that they do not want. Anothertechnique that some public libraries use to direct their patronsto pages that the libraries have determined to be accurate andvaluable is to establish links to \"recommended Web sites\" fromthe public library's home page (i.e., the page that appears whenpatrons begin a session at one of the library's public Internetterminals). Librarians select these recommended Web sites byusing criteria similar to those employed in traditionalcollection development. However, unless the library determinesotherwise, selection of these specific sites does not precludepatrons from attempting to access other Internet Web sites.\n\nLibraries may extend the \"recommended Web sites\" methodfurther by limiting patrons' access to only those Web sites thatare reviewed and selected by the library's staff. For example,in 1996, the Westerville, Ohio Library offered Internet accessto children through a service called the \"Library Channel.\" Thisservice was intended to be a means by which thelibrary could organize the Internet in some fashion forpresentation to patrons. Through the Library Channel, thecomputers in the children's section of the library wererestricted to 2,000 to 3,000 sites selected by librarians. Afterthree years, Westerville stopped using the Library Channelsystem because it overly constrained the children's ability toaccess materials on the Internet, and because the libraryexperienced several technical problems with the system.\n\nPublic libraries also use several different techniques toseparate patrons during Internet sessions so that they will notsee what other patrons are viewing. The simplest way to achievethis result is to position the library's public Internetterminals so that they are located away from traffic patterns inthe library (and from other terminals), for example, by placingthem so that they face a wall. This method is obviouslyconstrained by libraries' space limitations and physical layout.Some libraries have also installed privacy screens on theirpublic Internet terminals. These screens make a monitor appearblank unless the viewer is looking at it head-on.\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e5\u003c/span\u003eAlthough the Multnomah and Fort Vancouver Libraries submittedrecords showing that they have received few complaints regardingpatrons' unwilling exposure to materials on the Internet,privacy screens do not always prevent library patrons oremployees from inadvertently seeing the materials that anotherpatron is viewing when passing directly behind a terminal. Theyalso have the drawback of making it difficult for patrons towork together at a single terminal, or for librarians to assistpatrons at terminals, because it is difficult for two people tostand side by side and view a screen at the same time. Somelibrary patrons also find privacy screens to be a hindrance andhave attempted to remove them in order to improve the brightnessof the screen or to make the view better.\n\nAnother method that libraries use to prevent patrons fromseeing what other patrons are viewing on their terminals is theinstallation of \"recessed monitors.\" Recessed monitors arecomputer screens that sit below the level of a desk top and areviewed from above. Although recessed monitors, especially whencombined with privacy screens, eliminate almost all of thepossibility of a patron accidentally viewing the contents onanother patron's screen, they suffer from the same drawbacks asprivacy screens, that is, they make it difficult for patrons towork together or with a librarian at a single terminal. Somelibrarians also testified that recessed monitors are costly, butdid not indicate how expensive they are compared to privacyscreens or filtering software. A related technique that somepublic libraries use is to create a separate children's Internetviewing area, where no adults except those accompanying childrenin their care may use the Internet terminals. This serves theobjective of keeping children from inadvertently viewingmaterials appropriate only for adults that adults may be viewingon nearby terminals.\n\nA third set of techniques that public libraries have used toenforce their Internet use policies takes the opposite tack fromthe privacy screens/recessed monitors approach by placing all ofthe library'spublic Internet terminals in prominent and visible locations,such as near the library's reference desk. This approach allowslibrarians to enforce their library's Internet use policy byobserving what patrons are viewing and employing thetap-on-the-shoulder policy. Under this approach, when patronsare viewing materials that are inconsistent with the library'spolicies, a library staff member approaches them and asks themto view something else, or may ask them to end their Internetsession. A patron who does not comply with these requests, orwho repeatedly views materials not permitted under the library'sInternet use policy, may have his or her Internet or libraryprivileges suspended or revoked. But many librarians areuncomfortable with approaching patrons who are viewing sexuallyexplicit images, finding confrontation unpleasant. Hence somelibraries are reluctant to apply the tap-on-the-shoulder policy.\n\nThe fourth category of methods that public libraries employ toenforce their Internet use policies, and the one that gives riseto this case, is the use of Internet filtering software.According to the June 2000 Survey of Internet Access Managementin Public Libraries, approximately 7% of libraries with publicInternet access had mandated the use of blocking programs byadult patrons. Some public libraries provide patrons with theoption of using a blocking program, allowing patrons to decidewhether to engage the program when they or their children accessthe Internet. Other public libraries require their child patronsto use filtering software, but not their adult patrons.\n\nFiltering software vendors sell their products on asubscription basis. The cost of a subscription varies with thenumber of computers on which the filtering software will beused. In 2001, the cost of the Cyber Patrol filtering softwarewas $1,950 for 100 terminal licenses. The Greenville CountyLibrary System pays $2,500 per year for the N2H2 filteringsoftware, and a subscription to the Websense filter costsWesterville Public Library approximately $1,200 per year.\n\nNo evidence was presented on the cost of privacy screens,recessed monitors, and the tap-on-the-shoulder policy, relativeto the costs of filtering software. Nor did any of the librariesproffered by the government present any quantitative evidence onthe relative effectiveness of use of privacy screens to preventpatrons from being unwillingly exposed to sexually explicitmaterial, and the use of filters, discussed below. No evidencewas presented, for example, comparing the number of patroncomplaints in those libraries that have tried both methods.\n\nThe librarians who testified at trial whose libraries useInternet filtering software all provide methods by which theirpatrons may ask the library to unblock specific Web sites orpages. Of these, only the Tacoma Public Library allows patronsto request that a URL be unblocked without providing anyidentifying information; Tacoma allows patrons to request a URLby sending an email from the Internet terminal that the patronis using that does not contain a return email address for theuser. David Biek, the head librarian at the Tacoma Library'smain branch, testified at trial that the library keeps recordsthat would enable it to know which patrons made unblockingrequests, but does not use that information to connect userswith their requests. Biek also testified that he periodicallyscans the library's Internet use logs to search for: (1) URLsthat were erroneously blocked, so that he may unblock them; or(2) URLs that should have been blocked, but were not, in orderto add them to a blocked category list. In the course ofscanning the use logs, Biek hasalso found what looked like attempts to access childpornography. In two cases, he communicated his findings to lawenforcement and turned over the logs in response to a subpoena.\n\nAt all events, it takes time for librarians to make decisionsabout whether to honor patrons' requests to unblock Web pages.In the libraries proffered by the defendants, unblockingdecisions sometimes take between 24 hours and a week. Moreover,none of these libraries allows unrestricted access to theInternet pending a determination of the validity of a Web siteblocked by the blocking programs. A few of the defendants'proffered libraries represented that individual librarians wouldhave the discretion to allow a patron to have full Internetaccess on a staff computer upon request, but none claimed thatallowing such access was mandatory, and patron access issupervised in every instance. None of these libraries makesdifferential unblocking decisions based on the patrons' age.Unblocking decisions are usually made identically for adults andminors. Unblocking decisions even for adults are usually basedon suitability of the Web site for minors.\n\nIt is apparent that many patrons are reluctant or unwilling toask librarians to unblock Web pages or sites that contain onlymaterials that might be deemed personal or embarrassing, even ifthey are not sexually explicit or pornographic. We credit thetestimony of Emmalyn Rood, discussed above, that she would havebeen unwilling as a young teen to ask a librarian to disablefiltering software so that she could view materials concerninggay and lesbian issues. We also credit the testimony of MarkBrown, who stated that he would have been too embarrassed to aska librarian to disable filtering software if it had impeded hisability to research treatments and cosmetic surgery options forhis mother when she was diagnosed with breast cancer.\n\nThe pattern of patron requests to unblock specific URLs in thevarious libraries involved in this case also confirms ourfinding that patrons are largely unwilling to make unblockingrequests unless they are permitted to do so anonymously. Forexample, the Fulton County Library receives only about 6unblocking requests each year, the Greenville Public Library hasreceived only 28 unblocking requests since August 21, 2000, andthe Westerville, Ohio Library has received fewer than 10unblocking requests since 1999. In light of the fact that asubstantial amount of overblocking occurs in these verylibraries, see infra Subsection II.E.4, we find that the lackof unblocking requests in these libraries does not reflect theeffectiveness of the filters, but rather reflects patrons'reluctance to ask librarians to unblock sites.\n\nE. Internet Filtering Technology\n\n1. What Is Filtering Software, Who Makes It, and What Does It Do?\n\nCommercially available products that can be configured toblock or filter access to certain material on the Internet areamong the \"technology protection measures\" that may be used toattempt to comply with CIPA. There are numerous filteringsoftware products available commercially. Three network-basedfiltering products — SurfControl's Cyber Patrol, N2H2'sBess/i2100, and Secure Computing's SmartFilter — currently havethe lion's share of the public library market. The parties inthis case deposed representatives from these three companies.Websense, another network-based blocking product, is alsocurrently used in the public library market, and was discussedat trial.\n\nFiltering software may be installed either on an individualcomputer or on a computer network. Network-based filteringsoftware products are designed for use on a network of computersand funnel requests for Internet content through a centralizednetwork device. Of the various commercially available blockingproducts, network-based products are the ones generally marketedto institutions, such as public libraries, that provide Internetaccess through multiple terminals.\n\nFiltering programs function in a fairly simple way. When anInternet user requests access to a certain Web site or page,either by entering a domain name or IP address into a Webbrowser, or by clicking on a link, the filtering software checksthat domain name or IP address against a previously compiled\"control list\" that may contain up to hundreds of thousands ofURLs. The three companies deposed in this case have controllists containing between 200,000 and 600,000 URLs. These listsdetermine which URLs will be blocked.\n\nFiltering software companies divide their control lists intomultiple categories for which they have created uniquedefinitions. SurfControl uses 40 such categories, N2H2 uses 35categories (and seven \"exception\" categories), Websense uses 30categories, and Secure Computing uses 30 categories. Filteringsoftware customers choose which categories of URLs they wish toenable. A user \"enables\" a category in a filtering program byconfiguring the program to block all of the Web pages listed inthat category.\n\nThe following is a list of the categories offered by each ofthese four filtering programs. SurfControl's Cyber Patrol offersthe following categories: Adult/Sexually Explicit;Advertisements; Arts \u0026 Entertainment; Chat; Computing \u0026Internet; Criminal Skills; Drugs, Alcohol \u0026 Tobacco; Education;Finance \u0026 Investment; Food \u0026 Drink; Gambling; Games; Glamour \u0026Intimate Apparel; Government \u0026 Politics; Hacking; Hate Speech;Health \u0026 Medicine; Hobbies \u0026 Recreation; Hosting Sites; JobSearch \u0026 Career Development; Kids' Sites; Lifestyle \u0026 Culture;Motor Vehicles; News; Personals \u0026 Dating; Photo Searches; RealEstate; Reference; Religion; Remote Proxies; Sex Education;Search Engines; Shopping; Sports; Streaming Media; Travel;Usenet News; Violence; Weapons; and Web-based Email.\n\nN2H2 offers the following categories: Adults Only; Alcohol;Auction; Chat; Drugs; Electronic Commerce; Employment Search;Free Mail; Free Pages; Gambling; Games; Hate/Discrimination;Illegal; Jokes; Lingerie; Message/Bulletin Boards;Murder/Suicide; News; Nudity; Personal Information; Personals;Pornography; Profanity; Recreation/Entertainment; SchoolCheating Information; Search Engines; Search Terms; Sex; Sports;Stocks; Swimsuits; Tasteless/Gross; Tobacco; Violence; andWeapons. The \"Nudity\" category purports to block only\"non-pornographic\" images. The \"Sex\" category is intended toblock only those depictions of sexual activity that are notintended to arouse. The \"Tasteless/Gross\" category includescontents such as \"tasteless humor\" and \"graphic medical oraccident scene photos.\" Additionally, N2H2 offers seven\"exception categories.\" These exception categories includeEducation, Filtered Search Engine, For Kids, History, Medical,Moderated, and Text/Spoken Only. When an exception category isenabled, access to any Web site or page via a URL associatedwith both a category and an exception, for example, both \"Sex\"and \"Education,\" will be allowed, even if the customer hasenabled the product tootherwise block the category \"Sex.\" As of November 15, 2001, ofthose Web sites categorized by N2H2 as \"Sex,\" 3.6% were alsocategorized as \"Education,\" 2.9% as \"Medical,\" and 1.6% as\"History.\"\n\nWebsense offers the following categories: Abortion Advocacy;Advocacy Groups; Adult Material; Business \u0026 Economy; Drugs;Education; Entertainment; Gambling; Games; Government; Health;Illegal/Questionable; Information Technology; InternetCommunication; Job Search; Militancy/Extremist; News \u0026 Media;Productivity Management; Bandwidth Management; Racism/Hate;Religion; Shopping; Society \u0026 Lifestyle; Special Events; Sports;Tasteless; Travel; Vehicles; Violence; and Weapons. The \"Adult\"category includes \"full or partial nudity of individuals,\" aswell as sites offering \"light adult humor and literature\" and\"[s]exually explicit language.\" The \"Sexuality/Pornography\"category includes, inter alia, \"hard-core adult humor andliterature\" and \"[s]exually explicit language.\" The \"Tasteless\"category includes \"hard-to-stomach sites, including offensive,worthless or useless sites, grotesque or lurid depictions ofbodily harm.\" The \"Hacking\" category blocks \"sites providinginformation on or promoting illegal or questionable access to oruse of communications equipment and/or software.\"\n\nSmartFilter offers the following categories:Anonymizers/Translators; Art \u0026 Culture; Chat; Criminal Skills;Cults/Occult; Dating; Drugs; Entertainment;Extreme/Obscene/Violence; Gambling; Games; General News; HateSpeech; Humor; Investing; Job Search; Lifestyle; Mature; MP3Sites; Nudity; On-line Sales; Personal Pages; Politics, Opinion\u0026 Religion; Portal Sites; Self Help/Health; Sex; Sports; Travel;Usenet News; and Webmail.\n\nMost importantly, no category definition used by filteringsoftware companies is identical to CIPA's definitions of visualdepictions that are obscene, child pornography, or harmful tominors. And category definitions and categorization decisionsare made without reference to local community standards.Moreover, there is no judicial involvement in the creation offiltering software companies' category definitions and nojudicial determination is made before these companies categorizea Web page or site.\n\nEach filtering software company associates each URL in itscontrol list with a \"tag\" or other identifier that indicates thecompany's evaluation of whether the content or features of theWeb site or page accessed via that URL meets one or more of itscategory definitions. If a user attempts to access a Web site orpage that is blocked by the filter, the user is immediatelypresented with a screen that indicates that a block has occurredas a result of the operation of the filtering software. These\"denial screens\" appear only at the point that a user attemptsto access a site or page in an enabled category.\n\nAll four of the filtering programs on which evidence waspresented allow users to customize the category lists that existon their own PCs or servers by adding or removing specific URLs.For example, if a public librarian charged with administering alibrary's Internet terminals comes across a Web site that he orshe finds objectionable that is not blocked by the filteringprogram that his or her library is using, then the librarian mayadd that URL to a category list that exists only on thelibrary's network, and it would thereafter be blocked under thatcategory. Similarly, a customer may remove individual URLs fromcategory lists. Importantly, however, no one but the filteringcompanies has access to the complete list ofURLs in any category. The actual URLs or IP addresses of the Websites or pages contained in filtering software vendors' categorylists are considered to be proprietary information, and areunavailable for review by customers or the general public,including the proprietors of Web sites that are blocked byfiltering software.\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e6\u003c/span\u003e\n\nFiltering software companies do not generally notify theproprietors of Web sites when they block their sites. The onlyway to discover which URLs are blocked and which are not blockedby any particular filtering company is by testing individualURLs with filtering software, or by entering URLs one by oneinto the \"URL checker\" that most filtering software companiesprovide on their Web sites. Filtering software companies willentertain requests for recategorization from proprietors of Websites that discover their sites are blocked. Because new pagesare constantly being added to the Web, filtering companiesprovide their customers with periodic updates of category lists.Once a particular Web page or site is categorized, however,filtering companies generally do not re-review the contents ofthat page or site unless they receive a request to do so, eventhough the content on individual Web pages and sites changesfrequently.\n\n2. The Methods that Filtering Companies Use to Compile Category Lists\n\nWhile the way in which filtering programs operate isconceptually straightforward — by comparing a requested URL to apreviously compiled list of URLs and blocking access to thecontent at that URL if it appears on the list — accuratelycompiling and categorizing URLs to form the category lists is amore complex process that is impossible to conduct with any highdegree of accuracy. The specific methods that filtering softwarecompanies use to compile and categorize control lists are, likethe lists themselves, proprietary information. We will thereforeset forth only general information on the various types ofmethods that all filtering companies deposed in this case use,and the sources of error that are at once inherent in thosemethods and unavoidable given the current architecture of theInternet and the current state of the art in automatedclassification systems. We base our understanding of thesemethods largely on the detailed testimony and expert report ofDr. Geoffrey Nunberg, which we credit. The plaintiffs offered,and the Court qualified, Nunberg as an expert witness onautomated classification systems.\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e7\u003c/span\u003e\n\nWhen compiling and categorizing URLs for their category lists,filtering software companies go through two distinct phases.First, they must collect or \"harvest\" the relevant URLs from thevast number of sites that exist on the Web. Second, they mustsort through the URLs they have collected to determine underwhich of the company's self-defined categories (if any), theyshould be classified. These tasks necessarily result in atradeoff between overblocking (i.e., the blocking of contentthat does not meet the category definitions established by CIPAor by the filtering software companies), and underblocking(i.e., leaving off of a control list a URL that contains contentthat would meet the category definitions defined by CIPA or thefiltering software companies).\n\na. The \"Harvesting\" Phase\n\nFiltering software companies, given their limited resources,do not attempt to index or classify all of the billions of pagesthat exist on the Web. Instead, the set of pages that theyattempt to examine and classify is restricted to a small portionof the Web. The companies use a variety of automated and manualmethods to identify a universe of Web sites and pages to\"harvest\" for classification. These methods include: enteringcertain key words into search engines; following links from avariety of online directories (e.g., generalized directorieslike Yahoo or various specialized directories, such as thosethat provide links to sexually explicit content); reviewinglists of newly-registered domain names; buying or licensinglists of URLs from third parties; \"mining\" access logsmaintained by their customers; and reviewing other submissionsfrom customers and the public. The goal of each of these methodsis to identify as many URLs as possible that are likely tocontain content that falls within the filtering companies'category definitions.\n\nThe first method, entering certain keywords into commercialsearch engines, suffers from several limitations. First, the Webpages that may be \"harvested\" through this method are limited tothose pages that search engines have already identified.However, as noted above, a substantial portion of the Web is noteven theoretically indexable (because it is not linked to by anypreviously known page), and only approximately 50% of the pagesthat are theoretically indexable have actually been indexed bysearch engines. We are satisfied that the remainder of theindexable Web, and the vast \"Deep Web,\" which cannot currentlybe indexed, includes materials that meet CIPA's categories ofvisual depictions that are obscene, child pornography, andharmful to minors. These portions of the Web cannot presently beharvested through the methods that filtering software companiesuse (except through reporting by customers or by observingusers' log files), because they are not linked to other knownpages. A user can, however, gain access to a Web site in theunindexed Web or the Deep Web if the Web site's proprietor orsome other third party informs the user of the site's URL. SomeWeb sites, for example, send out mass email advertisementscontaining the site's URL, the spamming process we havedescribed above.\n\nSecond, the search engines that software companies use forharvesting are able to search text only, not images. This is ofcritical importance, because CIPA, by its own terms, covers only\"visual depictions.\" 20 U.S.C. § 9134(f)(1)(A)(i);47 U.S.C. § 254(h)(5)(B)(i). Image recognition technology is immature,ineffective, and unlikely to improve substantially in the nearfuture. None of the filtering software companies deposed in thiscase employs image recognition technology when harvesting orcategorizing URLs. Due to the reliance on automated textanalysis and the absence of image recognition technology, a Webpage with sexually explicit images and no text cannot beharvested using a search engine. This problem is complicated bythe fact that Web site publishers may use image files ratherthan text to represent words, i.e., they may use a file thatcomputers understand to be a picture, like a photograph of aprinted word, rather than regular text, making automated reviewof their textual content impossible.For example, if the Playboy Web site displays its name using alogo rather than regular text, a search engine would not see orrecognize the Playboy name in that logo.\n\nIn addition to collecting URLs through search engines and Webdirectories (particularly those specializing in sexuallyexplicit sites or other categories relevant to one of thefiltering companies' category definitions), and by mining userlogs and collecting URLs submitted by users, the filteringcompanies expand their list of harvested URLs by using\"spidering\" software that can \"crawl\" the lists of pagesproduced by the previous four methods, following their linksdownward to bring back the pages to which they link (and thepages to which those pages link, and so on, but usually downonly a few levels). This spidering software uses the same typeof technology that commercial Web search engines use.\n\nWhile useful in expanding the number of relevant URLs, theability to retrieve additional pages through this approach islimited by the architectural feature of the Web thatpage-to-page links tend to converge rather than diverge. Thatmeans that the more pages from which one spiders downwardthrough links, the smaller the proportion of new sites one willuncover; if spidering the links of 1000 sites retrieved througha search engine or Web directory turns up 500 additionaldistinct adult sites, spidering an additional 1000 sites mayturn up, for example, only 250 additional distinct sites, andthe proportion of new sites uncovered will continue to diminishas more pages are spidered.\n\nThese limitations on the technology used to harvest a set ofURLs for review will necessarily lead to substantialunderblocking of material with respect to both the categorydefinitions employed by filtering software companies and CIPA'sdefinitions of visual depictions that are obscene, childpornography, or harmful to minors.\n\nb. The \"Winnowing\" or Categorization Phase\n\nOnce the URLs have been harvested, some filtering softwarecompanies use automated key word analysis tools to evaluate thecontent and/or features of Web sites or pages accessed via aparticular URL and to tentatively prioritize or categorize them.This process may be characterized as \"winnowing\" the harvestedURLs. Automated systems currently used by filtering softwarevendors to prioritize, and to categorize or tentativelycategorize the content and/or features of a Web site or pageaccessed via a particular URL operate by means of (1) simple keyword searching, and (2) the use of statistical algorithms thatrely on the frequency and structure of various linguisticfeatures in a Web page's text. The automated systems used tocategorize pages do not include image recognition technology.All of the filtering companies deposed in the case also employhuman review of some or all collected Web pages at some pointduring the process of categorizing Web pages. As with theharvesting process, each technique employed in the winnowingprocess is subject to limitations that can result in bothoverblocking and underblocking.\n\nFirst, simple key-word-based filters are subject to theobvious limitation that no string of words can identify allsites that contain sexually explicit content, and most stringsof words are likely to appear in Web sites that are not properlyclassified as containing sexually explicit content. As notedabove, filtering software companies also use more sophisticatedautomated classification systems for the statisticalclassification of texts. These systems assign weights to wordsor other textual features and use algorithms to determinewhether a text belongs to a certain category. These algorithmssometimes make reference to the position of a word within a textor its relative proximity to other words. The weights areusually determined by machine learning methods (often describedas \"artificial intelligence\"). In this procedure, whichresembles an automated form of trial and error, a system isgiven a \"training set\" consisting of documents preclassifiedinto two or more groups, along with a set of features that mightbe potentially useful in classifying the sets. The system then\"learns\" rules that assign weights to those features accordingto how well they work in classification, and assigns each newdocument to a category with a certain probability.\n\nNotwithstanding their \"artificial intelligence\" description,automated text classification systems are unable to grasp manydistinctions between types of content that would be obvious to ahuman. And of critical importance, no presently conceivabletechnology can make the judgments necessary to determine whethera visual depiction fits the legal definitions of obscenity,child pornography, or harmful to minors.\n\nFinally, all the filtering software companies deposed in thiscase use some form of human review in their process of winnowingand categorizing Web pages, although one company admitted tocategorizing some Web pages without any human review.SmartFilter states that \"the final categorization of every Website is done by a human reviewer.\" Another filtering companyasserts that of the 10,000 to 30,000 Web pages that enter the\"work queue\" to be categorized each day, two to three percent ofthose are automatically categorized by their PornByRef system(which only applies to materials classified in the pornographycategory), and the remainder are categorized by human review.SurfControl also states that no URL is ever added to itsdatabase without human review.\n\nHuman review of Web pages has the advantage of allowing morenuanced, if not more accurate, interpretations than automatedclassification systems are capable of making, but suffers fromits own sources of error. The filtering software companiesinvolved here have limited staff, of between eight and a fewdozen people, available for hand reviewing Web pages. Thereviewers that are employed by these companies base theircategorization decisions on both the text and the visualdepictions that appear on the sites or pages they are assignedto review. Human reviewers generally focus on English languageWeb sites, and are generally not required to be multi-lingual.\n\nGiven the speed at which human reviewers must work to keep upwith even a fraction of the approximately 1.5 million pagesadded to the publicly indexable Web each day, human error isinevitable. Errors are likely to result from boredom or lack ofattentiveness, overzealousness, or a desire to \"err on the sideof caution\" by screening out material that might be offensive tosome customers, even if it does not fit within any of thecompany's category definitions. None of the filtering companiestrains its reviewers in the legal definitions concerning what isobscene, child pornography, or harmful to minors, and noneinstructs reviewers to take community standards into accountwhen making categorization decisions.\n\nPerhaps because of limitations on the number of humanreviewers and because of the large number of new pages that areadded to the Web every day, filtering companies also widelyengage in the practice of categorizing entire Web sites at the\"root URL,\" rather than engaging in a more fine-grained analysisof theindividual pages within a Web site. For example, the filteringsoftware companies deposed in this case all categorize theentire Playboy Web site as Adult, Sexually Explicit, orPornography. They do not differentiate between pages within thesite containing sexually explicit images or text, and forexample, pages containing no sexually explicit content, such asthe text of interviews of celebrities or politicians. If the\"root\" or \"top-level\" URL of a Web site is given a category tag,then access to all content on that Web site will be blocked ifthe assigned category is enabled by a customer.\n\nIn some cases, whole Web sites are blocked because thefiltering companies focus only on the content of the home pagethat is accessed by entering the root URL. Entire Web sitescontaining multiple Web pages are commonly categorized withouthuman review of each individual page on that site. Web sitesthat may contain multiple Web pages and that requireauthentication or payment for access are commonly categorizedbased solely on a human reviewer's evaluation of the pages thatmay be viewed prior to reaching the authentication or paymentpage.\n\nBecause there may be hundreds or thousands of pages under aroot URL, filtering companies make it their primary mission tocategorize the root URL, and categorize subsidiary pages if theneed arises or if there is time. This form of overblocking iscalled \"inheritance,\" because lower-level pages inherit thecategorization of the root URL without regard to their specificcontent. In some cases, \"reverse inheritance\" also occurs, i.e.,parent sites inherit the classification of pages in a lowerlevel of the site. This might happen when pages with sexualcontent appear in a Web site that is devoted primarily tonon-sexual content. For example, N2H2's Bess filtering productclassifies every page in the Salon.com Web site, which containsa wide range of news and cultural commentary, as \"Sex,Profanity,\" based on the fact that the site includes a regularcolumn that deals with sexual issues.\n\nBlocking by both domain name and IP address is anotherpractice in which filtering companies engage that is a functionboth of the architecture of the Web and of the exigencies ofdealing with the rapidly expanding number of Web pages. Thecategory lists maintained by filtering software companies caninclude URLs in either their human-readable domain name addressform, their numeric IP address form, or both. Through \"virtualhosting\" services, hundreds of thousands of Web sites withdistinct domain names may share a single numeric IP address. Tothe extent that filtering companies block the IP addresses ofvirtual hosting services, they will necessarily block asubstantial amount of content without reviewing it, and willlikely overblock a substantial amount of content.\n\nAnother technique that filtering companies use in order todeal with a structural feature of the Internet is blocking theroot level URLs of so-called \"loophole\" Web sites. These are Websites that provide access to a particular Web page, but displayin the user's browser a URL that is different from the URL withwhich the particular page is usually associated. Because of thisfeature, they provide a \"loophole\" that can be used to getaround filtering software, i.e., they display a URL that isdifferent from the one that appears on the filtering company'scontrol list. \"Loophole\" Web sites include caches of Web pagesthat have been removed from their original location,\"anonymizer\" sites, and translation sites.\n\nCaches are archived copies that some search engines, such asGoogle, keep of the Web pages they index. The cached copystored by Google will have a URL that is different from theoriginal URL. Because Web sites often change rapidly, caches arethe only way to access pages that have been taken down, revised,or have changed their URLs for some reason. For example, amagazine might place its current stories under a given URL, andreplace them monthly with new stories. If a user wanted to findan article published six months ago, he or she would be unableto access it if not for Google's cached version.\n\nSome sites on the Web serve as a proxy or intermediary betweena user and another Web page. When using a proxy server, a userdoes not access the page from its original URL, but rather fromthe URL of the proxy server. One type of proxy service is an\"anonymizer.\" Users may access Web sites indirectly via ananonymizer when they do not want the Web site they are visitingto be able to determine the IP address from which they areaccessing the site, or to leave \"cookies\" on theirbrowser.\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e8\u003c/span\u003e Some proxy servers can be used to attempt totranslate Web page content from one language to another. Ratherthan directly accessing the original Web page in its originallanguage, users can instead indirectly access the page via aproxy server offering translation features.\n\nAs noted above, filtering companies often block loopholesites, such as caches, anonymizers, and translation sites. Thepractice of blocking loophole sites necessarily results in asignificant amount of overblocking, because the vast majority ofthe pages that are cached, for example, do not contain contentthat would match a filtering company's category definitions.Filters that do not block these loophole sites, however, mayenable users to access any URL on the Web via the loophole site,thus resulting in substantial underblocking.\n\nc. The Process for \"Re-Reviewing\" Web Pages After Their Initial Categorization\n\nMost filtering software companies do not engage in subsequentreviews of categorized sites or pages on a scheduled basis.Priority is placed on reviewing and categorizing new sites andpages, rather than on re-reviewing already categorized sites andpages. Typically, a filtering software vendor's previouscategorization of a Web site is not re-reviewed for accuracywhen new pages are added to the Web site. To the extent the Website was previously categorized as a whole, the new pages addedto the site usually share the categorization assigned by theblocking product vendor. This necessarily results in both over-and underblocking, because, as noted above, the content of Webpages and Web sites changes relatively rapidly.\n\nIn addition to the content on Web sites or pages changingrapidly, Web sites themselves may disappear and be replaced bysites with entirely different content. If an IP addressassociated with a particular Web site is blocked under aparticular category and the Web site goes out of existence, thenthe IP address likely would be reassigned to a different Website, either by an Internet service provider or by aregistration organization, such as the American Registry forInternet Numbers, see http://www.arin.net. In that case, thesite that received the reassigned IP address would likely bemiscategorized. Because filtering companies do not engage insystematic re-review of their category lists, such a site wouldlikely remainmiscategorized unless someone submitted it to the filteringcompany for re-review, increasing the incidence of over- andunderblocking.\n\nThis failure to re-review Web pages primarily increases afiltering company's rate of overblocking. However, if afiltering company does not re-review Web pages after itdetermines that they do not fall into any of its blockingcategories, then that would result in underblocking (because,for example, a page might add sexually explicit content).\n\n3. The Inherent Tradeoff Between Overblocking and Underblocking\n\nThere is an inherent tradeoff between any filter's rate ofoverblocking (which information scientists also call\"precision\") and its rate of underblocking (which is alsoreferred to as \"recall\"). The rate of overblocking or precisionis measured by the proportion of the things a classificationsystem assigns to a certain category that are appropriatelyclassified. The plaintiffs' expert, Dr. Nunberg, provided thehypothetical example of a classification system that is asked topick out pictures of dogs from a database consisting of 1000pictures of animals, of which 80 were actually dogs. If itreturned 100 hits, of which 80 were in fact pictures of dogs,and the remaining 20 were pictures of cats, horses, and deer, wewould say that the system identified dog pictures with aprecision of 80%. This would be analogous to a filter thatoverblocked at a rate of 20%.\n\nThe recall measure involves determining what proportion of theactual members of a category the classification system has beenable to identify. For example, if the hypotheticalanimal-picture database contained a total of 200 pictures ofdogs, and the system identified 80 of them and failed toidentify 120, it would have performed with a recall of 40%. Thiswould be analogous to a filter that underblocked 60% of thematerial in a category.\n\nIn automated classification systems, there is always atradeoff between precision and recall. In the animal-pictureexample, the recall could be improved by using a looser set ofcriteria to identify the dog pictures in the set, such as anyanimal with four legs, and all the dogs would be identified, butcats and other animals would also be included, with a resultingloss of precision. The same tradeoff exists between rates ofoverblocking and underblocking in filtering systems that useautomated classification systems. For example, an automatedsystem that classifies any Web page that contains the word \"sex\"as sexually explicit will underblock much less, but overblockmuch more, than a system that classifies any Web page containingthe phrase \"free pictures of people having sex\" as sexuallyexplicit.\n\nThis tradeoff between overblocking and underblocking alsoapplies not just to automated classification systems, but alsoto filters that use only human review. Given the approximatelytwo billion pages that exist on the Web, the 1.5 million newpages that are added daily, and the rate at which content onexisting pages changes, if a filtering company blocks only thoseWeb pages that have been reviewed by humans, it will beimpossible, as a practical matter, to avoid vast amounts ofunderblocking. Techniques used by human reviewers such asblocking at the IP address level, domain name level, ordirectory level reduce the rates of underblocking, butnecessarily increase the rates of overblocking, as discussedabove.\n\nTo use a simple example, it would be easy to design a filterintended to block sexually explicit speech that completelyavoids overblocking. Such a filter would have only a singlesexually explicit Web site on its control list, which could berereviewed daily to ensure that its content does not change.While there would be no overblocking problem with such a filter,such a filter would have a severe underblocking problem, as itwould fail to block all the sexually explicit speech on the Webother than the one site on its control list. Similarly, it wouldalso be easy to design a filter intended to block sexuallyexplicit speech that completely avoids underblocking. Such afilter would operate by permitting users to view only a singleWeb site, e.g., the Sesame Street Web site. While there would beno underblocking problem with such a filter, it would have asevere overblocking problem, as it would block access tomillions of non-sexually explicit sites on the Web other thanthe Sesame Street site.\n\nWhile it is thus quite simple to design a filter that does notoverblock, and equally simple to design a filter that does notunderblock, it is currently impossible, given the Internet'ssize, rate of growth, rate of change, and architecture, andgiven the state of the art of automated classification systems,to develop a filter that neither underblocks nor overblocks asubstantial amount of speech. The more effective a filter is atblocking Web sites in a given category, the more the filter willnecessarily overblock. Any filter that is reasonably effectivein preventing users from accessing sexually explicit content onthe Web will necessarily block substantial amounts ofnon-sexually explicit speech.\n\n4. Attempts to Quantify Filtering Programs' Rates of Over- and Underblocking\n\nThe government presented three studies, two from expertwitnesses, and one from a librarian fact witness who conducted astudy using Internet use logs from his own library, that attemptto quantify the over- and underblocking rates of five differentfiltering programs. The plaintiffs presented one expert witnesswho attempted to quantify the rates of over- and underblockingfor various programs. Each of these attempts to quantify ratesof over-and underblocking suffers from various methodologicalflaws.\n\nThe fundamental problem with calculating over- andunderblocking rates is selecting a universe of Web sites or Webpages to serve as the set to be tested. The studies that theparties submitted in this case took two different approaches tothis problem. Two of the studies, one prepared by theplaintiffs' expert witness Chris Hunter, a graduate student atthe University of Pennsylvania, and the other prepared by thedefendants' expert, Chris Lemmons of eTesting Laboratories, inResearch Triangle Park, North Carolina, approached this problemby compiling two separate lists of Web sites, one of URLs thatthey deemed should be blocked according to the filters'criteria, and another of URLs that they deemed should not beblocked according to the filters' criteria. They compiled theselists by choosing Web sites from the results of certain key wordsearches.\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e9\u003c/span\u003e The problem with this selectionmethod is that it is neither random, nor does it necessarilyapproximate the universe of Web pages that library patronsvisit.\n\nThe two other studies, one by David Biek, head librarian atthe Tacoma Public Library's main branch, and one by Cory Finnellof Certus Consulting Group, of Seattle, Washington, chose actuallogs of Web pages visited by library patrons during specifictime periods as the universe of Web pages to analyze. Thismethod, while surely not as accurate as a truly random sample ofthe indexed Web would be (assuming it would be possible to takesuch a sample), has the virtue of using the actual Web sitesthat library patrons visited during a specific period. Becauselibrary patrons selected the universe of Web sites that Biek andFinnell's studies analyzed, this removes the possibility of biasresulting from the study author's selection of the universe ofsites to be reviewed. We find that the Lemmons and Hunterstudies are of little probative value because of the methodologyused to select the sample universe of Web sites to be tested. Wewill therefore focus on the studies conducted by Finnell andBiek in trying to ascertain estimates of the rates of over- andunderblocking that takes place when filters are used in publiclibraries.\n\nThe government hired expert witness Cory Finnell to study theInternet logs compiled by the public libraries systems inTacoma, Washington; Westerville, Ohio; and Greenville, SouthCarolina. Each of these libraries uses filtering software thatkeeps a log of information about individual Web site requestsmade by library patrons. Finnell, whose consulting firmspecializes in data analysis, has substantial experienceevaluating Internet access logs generated on networked systems.He spent more than a year developing a reporting tool for N2H2,and, in the course of that work, acquired a familiarity with thedesign and operation of Internet filtering products.\n\nThe Tacoma library uses Cyber Patrol filtering software, andlogs information only on sites that were blocked. Finnell workedfrom a list of all sites that were blocked in the Tacoma publiclibrary in the month of August 2001. The Westerville libraryuses the Websense filtering product, and logs information onboth blocked sites and non-blocked sites. When the logs reach acertain size, they are overwritten by new usage logs. Because ofthis overwriting feature, logs were available to Finnell onlyfor the relatively short period from October 1, 2001 to October3, 2001. The Greenville library uses N2H2's filtering productand logs both blocked sites and sites that patrons accessed. Thelogs contain more than 500,000 records per day. Because of thevolume of therecords, Finnell restricted his analysis to the period fromAugust 2, 2001 to August 15, 2001.\n\nFinnell calculated an overblocking rate for each of the threelibraries by examining the host Web site containing each of theblocked pages. He did not employ a sampling technique, butinstead examined each blocked Web site. If the contents of ahost Web site or the pages within the Web site were consistentwith the filtering product's definition of the category underwhich the site was blocked, Finnell considered it to be anaccurate block. Finnell and three others, two of whom weretemporary employees, examined the Web sites to determine whetherthey were consistent with the filtering companies' categorydefinitions. Their review was, of course, necessarily limitedby: (1) the clarity of the filtering companies' categorydefinitions; (2) Finnell's and his employees' interpretations ofthe definitions; and (3) human error. The study's reliability isalso undercut by the fact that Finnell failed to archive theblocked Web pages as they existed either at the point that apatron in one of the three libraries was denied access or whenFinnell and his team reviewed the pages. It is thereforeimpossible for anyone to check the accuracy and consistency ofFinnell's review team, or to know whether the pages containedthe same content when the block occurred as they did whenFinnell's team reviewed them. This is a key flaw, because theresults of the study depend on individual determinations as tooverblocking and underblocking, in which Finnell and his teamwere required to compare what they saw on the Web pages thatthey reviewed with standard definitions provided by thefiltering company.\n\nTacoma library's Cyber Patrol software blocked 836 unique Websites during the month of August. Finnell determined that 783 ofthose blocks were accurate and that 53 were inaccurate.\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e10\u003c/span\u003eThe error rate for Cyber Patrol was therefore estimated to be6.34%, and the true error rate was estimated with 95% confidenceto lie within the range of 4.69% to 7.99%.\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e11\u003c/span\u003e Finnell andhis team reviewed 185 unique Web sites that were blocked byWesterville Library's Websense filter during the logged periodand determined that 158 of them were accurate and that 27 ofthem were inaccurate. He therefore estimated the Websensefilter's overblocking rate at 14.59% with a 95% confidenceinterval of 9.51% to 19.68%. Additionally, Finnell examined1,674 unique Web sites that were blocked by the GreenvilleLibrary's N2H2 filter during the relevant period and determinedthat 1,520 were accurate and that 87 were inaccurate. Thisyields an estimated overblocking rate of 5.41% and a 95%confidence interval of 4.33% to 6.55%.\n\nFinnell's methodology was materially flawed in that itunderstates the rate of overblocking for the following reasons.First, patrons from the three libraries knew that the filterswere operating, and may have been deterred from attempting toaccess Web sites that they perceived to be \"borderline\" sites,i.e., those that may or may not have been appropriately filteredaccording to the filtering companies' category definitions.Second, in their cross-examination of Finnell, the plaintiffsoffered screen shots of a number of Web sites that, according toFinnell, had been appropriately blocked, but that Finnelladmitted contained only benign materials. Finnell's explanationwas that the Web sites must have changed between the time whenhe conducted the study and the time of the trial, but because hedid not archive the images as they existed when his teamreviewed them for the study, there is no way to verify this.Third, because of the way in which Finnell counted blocked Websites — i.e., if separate patrons attempted to reach the sameWeb site, or one or more patrons attempted to access more thanone page on a single Web site, Finnell counted these attempts asa single block, see supra note 10 — his results necessarilyunderstate the number of times that patrons were erroneouslydenied access to information.\n\nAt all events, there is no doubt that Finnell's estimatedrates of overblocking, which are based on the filteringcompanies' own category definitions, significantly understatethe rate of overblocking with respect to CIPA's categorydefinitions for filtering for adults. The filters used in theTacoma, Westerville, and Greenville libraries were configured toblock, among other things, images of full nudity and sexuallyexplicit materials. There is no dispute, however, that thesecategories are far broader than CIPA's categories of visualdepictions that are obscene, or child pornography, the twocategories of material that libraries subject to CIPA mustcertify that they filter during adults' use of the Internet.\n\nFinnell's study also calculated underblocking rates withrespect to the Westerville and Greenville Libraries (both ofwhich logged not only their blocked sites, but all sites visitedby their patrons), by taking random samples of URLs from thelist of sites that were not blocked. The study used a sample of159 sites that were accessed by Westerville patrons anddetermined that only one of them should have been blocked underthe software's category definitions, yielding an underblockingrate of 0.6%. Given the size of the sample, the 95% confidenceinterval is 0% to 1.86%. The study examined a sample of 254 Websites accessed by patrons in Greenville and found that three ofthem should have been blocked under the filtering software'scategory definitions. This results in an estimated underblockingrate of 1.2% with a 95% confidence interval ranging from 0% to2.51%.\n\nWe do not credit Finnell's estimates of the rates ofunderblocking in the Westerville and Greenville public librariesfor several reasons. First, Finnell's estimates likelyunderstate the actual rate of underblocking because patrons, whoknew that filtering programs were operating in the Greenvilleand Westerville Libraries, may have refrained from attempting toaccess sites with sexually explicit materials, or other contentsthat they knew would probably meet a filtering program's blockedcategories. Second, and most importantly, we think that theformula that Finnell used to calculate the rate of underblockingin these two libraries is not as meaningful as the formula thatinformation scientists typically use to calculate a rate ofrecall, which we describe above in Subsection II. E.3. As Dr.Nunberg explained, the standard method that informationscientists use to calculate a rate of recall is to sort a set ofitems into two groups, those that fall into a particularcategory (e.g., those thatshould have been blocked by a filter) and those that do not. Therate of recall is then calculated by dividing the number ofitems that the system correctly identified as belonging to thecategory by the total number of items in the category.\n\nIn the example above, we discussed a database that contained1000 photographs. Assume that 200 of these photographs werepictures of dogs. If, for example, a classification systemdesigned to identify pictures of dogs identified 80 of the dogpictures and failed to identify 120, it would have performedwith a recall rate of 40%. This would be analogous to a filterthat underblocked at a rate of 60%. To calculate the recall rateof the filters in the Westerville and Greenville publiclibraries in accordance with the standard method describedabove, Finnell should have taken a sample of sites from thelibraries' Internet use logs (including both sites that wereblocked and sites that were not), and divided the number ofsites in the sample that the filter incorrectly failed to blockby the total number of sites in the sample that should have beenblocked. What Finnell did instead was to take a sample of sitesthat were not blocked, and divide the total number of sites inthis sample by the number of sites in the sample that shouldhave been blocked. This made the denominator that Finnell usedmuch larger than it would have been had he used the standardmethod for calculating recall, consequently making theunderblocking rate that he calculated much lower than it wouldhave been under the standard method.\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e12\u003c/span\u003e\n\nMoreover, despite the relatively low rates of underblockingthat Finnell's study found, librarians from several of thelibraries proffered by defendants that use blocking products,including Greenville, Tacoma, and Westerville, testified thatthere are instances of underblocking in their libraries. Noquantitative evidence was presented comparing the effectivenessof filters and other alternative methods used by libraries toprevent patrons from accessing visual depictions that areobscene, child pornography, or in the case of minors, harmful tominors.\n\nBiek undertook a similar study of the overblocking rates thatresult from the Tacoma Library's use of the Cyber Patrolsoftware. He began with the 3,733 individual blocks thatoccurred in the Tacoma Library in October 2000 and drew fromthis data set a random sample of 786 URLs. He calculated tworates of overblocking, one with respect to the Tacoma Library'spolicy on Internet use — that the pictorial content of the sitemay not include \"graphic materials depicting full nudity andsexual acts which are portrayed obviously and exclusively forsensational or pornographic purposes\" — and the other withrespect to Cyber Patrol's own category definitions. He estimatedthat Cyber Patrol overblocked 4% of all Web pages in October2000 with respect to the definitions of the Tacoma Library'sInternetPolicy and 2% of all pages with respect to Cyber Patrol's owncategory definitions.\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e13\u003c/span\u003e\n\nIt is difficult to determine how reliable Biek's conclusionsare, because he did not keep records of the raw data that heused in his study; nor did he archive images of the Web pages asthey looked when he made the determination whether they wereproperly classified by the Cyber Patrol program. Without thisinformation, it is impossible to verify his conclusions (or toundermine them). And Biek's study certainly understates CyberPatrol's overblocking rate for some of the same reasons thatFinnell's study likely understates the true rates ofoverblocking used in the libraries that he studied.\n\nWe also note that Finnell's study, which analyzed a set ofInternet logs from the Tacoma Library during which the samefiltering program was operating with the same set of blockingcategories enabled, found a significantly higher rate ofoverblocking than the Biek study did. Biek found a rate ofoverblocking of approximately 2% while the Finnell studyestimated a 6.34% rate of overblocking. At all events, thecategory definitions employed by CIPA, at least with respect toadult use — visual depictions that are obscene or childpornography — are narrower than the materials prohibited by theTacoma Library policy, and therefore Biek's study understatesthe rate of overblocking with respect to CIPA's definitions foradults.\n\nIn sum, we think that Finnell's study, while we do not creditits estimates of underblocking, is useful because it stateslower bounds with respect to the rates of overblocking thatoccurred when the Cyber Patrol, Websense, and N2H2 filters wereoperating in public libraries. While these rates are substantial— between nearly 6% and 15 — we think, for the reasons statedabove, that they greatly understate the actual rates ofoverblocking that occurs, and therefore cannot be considered asanything more than minimum estimates of the rates ofoverblocking that happens in all filtering programs.\n\n5. Methods of Obtaining Examples of Erroneously Blocked Web Sites\n\nThe plaintiffs assembled a list of several thousand Web sitesthat they contend were, at the time of the study, likely to havebeen erroneously blocked by one or more of four major commercialfiltering programs: SurfControl Cyber Patrol 6.0.1.47, N2H2Internet Filtering 2.0, Secure Computing SmartFilter 3.0.0.01,and Websense Enterprise 4.3.0. They compiled this list using atwo-step process. First, Benjamin Edelman, an expert witness whotestified before us, compiled a list of more than 500,000 URLsand devised a program to feed them through all four filteringprograms in order to compile a list of URLs that might have beenerroneously blocked by one or more of the programs.\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e14\u003c/span\u003eSecond, Edelman forwarded subsets of the list that he compiledto librarians and professors of library science whom theplaintiffs had hired to review the blocked sites for suitabilityin the public library context.\n\nEdelman assembled the list of URLs by compiling Web pages thatwere blocked by the following categories in the four programs:Cyber Patrol: Adult/Sexually Explicit; N2H2: Adults Only,Nudity,Pornography, and Sex, with \"exceptions\" engaged in thecategories of Education, For Kids, History, Medical, Moderated,and Text/Spoken Only; SmartFilter: Sex, Nudity, Mature, andExtreme; Websense: Adult Content, Nudity, and Sex.\n\nEdelman then assembled a database of Web sites for possibletesting. He derived this list by automatically compiling URLsfrom the Yahoo index of Web sites, taking them from categoriesfrom the Yahoo index that differed significantly from theclassifications that he had enabled in each of the blockingprograms (taking, for example, Web sites from Yahoo's\"Government\" category). He then expanded this list by enteringURLs taken from the Yahoo index into the Google search engine's\"related\" search function, which provides the user with a listof similar sites. Edelman also included and excluded specificWeb sites at the request of the plaintiffs' counsel.\n\nTaking the list of more than 500,000 URLs that he hadcompiled, Edelman used an automated system that he had developedto test whether particular URLs were blocked by each of the fourfiltering programs. This testing took place between February andOctober 2001. He recorded the specific dates on which particularsites were blocked by particular programs, and, using commercialarchiving software, archived the contents of the home page ofthe blocked Web sites (and in some instances the pages linked tofrom the home page) as it existed when it was blocked.\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e15\u003c/span\u003eThrough this process, Edelman, whose testimony we credit,compiled a list of 6,777 URLs that were blocked by one or moreof the four programs. Because these sites were chosen fromcategories from the Yahoo directory that were unrelated to thefiltering categories that were enabled during the test (i.e.,\"Government\" vs. \"Nudity\"), he reasoned that they were likelyerroneously blocked. As explained in the margin, Edelmanrepeated his testing and discovered that Cyber Patrol hadunblocked most of the pages on the list of 6,777 after he hadpublished the list on his Web site. His records indicate that anemployee of SurfControl (the company that produces Cyber Patrolsoftware) accessed his site and presumably checked out the URLson the list, thus confirming Edelman's judgment that themajority of URLs on the list were erroneously blocked.\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e16\u003c/span\u003e\n\nEdelman forwarded the list of blocked sites to Dr. JosephJanes, an Assistant Professor in the Information School of theUniversity of Washington who also testified at trial as anexpert witness. Janes reviewed the sites that Edelman compiledto determine whether they are consistentwith library collection development, i.e., whether they aresites to which a reference librarian would, consistent withprofessional standards, direct a patron as a source ofinformation.\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e17\u003c/span\u003e\n\nEdelman forwarded Janes a list of 6,775 Web sites, almost theentire list of blocked sites that he collected, from which Janestook a random sample of 859 using the SPSS statistical softwarepackage. Janes indicated that he chose a sample size of 859because it would yield a 95% confidence interval of plus orminus 2.5%. Janes recruited a group of 16 reviewers, most ofwhom were current or former students at the University ofWashington's Information School, to help him identify whichsites were appropriate for library use. We describe the processthat he used in the margin.\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e18\u003c/span\u003e Due to the inability of amember of Janes's review team to complete the reviewing process,Janes had to cut 157 Web sites out of the sample, but becausethe Web sites were randomly assigned to reviewers, it isunlikely that these sites differed significantly from the restof the sample. That left the sample size at 699, which widenedthe 95% confidence interval to plus or minus 2.8%.\n\nOf the total 699 sites reviewed, Janes's team concluded that165 of them, or 23.6% percent of the sample, were not of anyvalue in the library context (i.e., no librarian would,consistent with professional standards, refer a patron to thesesites as a source of information). They were unable to find 60of the Web sites, or 8.6% of the sample. Therefore, theyconcluded that the remaining 474 Web sites, or 67.8% of thesample, were examples of overblocking with respect to materialsthat are appropriate sources of information in public libraries.Applying a 95% confidence interval of plus or minus 2.8%, thestudy concluded that we can be 95% confident that the actualpercentage of sites in the list of 6,775 sites that areappropriate for use in public libraries is somewhere between65.0% and 70.6%. In other words, we can be 95% certain that theactual number of sites out of the 6,775 that Edelman forwardedto Janes that are appropriate for use in public libraries (underJanes's standard) is somewhere between 4,403 and 4,783.\n\nThe government raised some valid criticisms of Janes'smethodology, attacking in particular the fact that, while sitesthat received two \"yes\" votes in the first round of voting weredetermined to be of sufficient interest in a library context tobe removed from further analysis, sites receiving one or two\"no\" votes were sent to the next round. The government alsocorrectly points out that results of Janes's study can begeneralized only to the population of 6,775 sites that Edelmanforwarded to Janes. Even taking these criticisms into account,and discounting Janes's numbers appropriately, we credit Janes'sstudy as confirming that Edelman's set of 6,775 Web sitescontains at least a few thousand URLs that were erroneouslyblocked by one or more of the four filtering programs that heused, whether judged against CIPA's definitions, the filters'own category criteria, or against the standard that the Janesstudy used. Edelman tested only 500,000 unique URLs out of the4000 times that many, or two billion, that are estimated toexist in the indexable Web. Even assuming that Edelman chose theURLs that were most likely to be erroneously blocked bycommercial filtering programs, we conclude that many times thenumber of pages that Edelman identified are erroneously blockedby one or more of the filtering programs that he tested.\n\nEdelman's and Janes's studies provide numerous specificexamples of Web pages that were erroneously blocked by one ormore filtering programs. The Web pages that were erroneouslyblocked by one or more of the filtering programs do not fallinto any neat patterns; they range widely in subject matter, andit is difficult to tell why they may have been overblocked. Thelist that Edelman compiled, forexample, contains Web pages relating to religion, politics andgovernment, health, careers, education, travel, sports, and manyother topics. In the next section, we provide examples from eachof these categories.\n\n6. Examples of Erroneously Blocked Web Sites\n\nSeveral of the erroneously blocked Web sites had contentrelating to churches, religious orders, religious charities, andreligious fellowship organizations. These included the followingWeb sites: the Knights of Columbus Council 4828, a Catholicmen's group associated with St. Patrick's Church in Fallon,Nevada, http://msnhomepages.talkcity.com/SpiritSt/kofc4828,which was blocked by Cyber Patrol in the \"Adult/SexuallyExplicit\" category; the Agape Church of Searcy, Arkansas,http://www.agapechurch.com, which was blocked by Websense as\"Adult Content\"; the home page of the Lesbian and Gay Havurahof the Long Beach, California Jewish Community Center,http://www.compupix.com/gay/havurah. htm, which was blocked byN2H2 as \"Adults Only, Pornography,\" by Smartfilter as \"Sex,\" andby Websense as \"Sex\"; Orphanage Emmanuel, a Christian orphanagein Honduras that houses 225 children,http://home8.inet.tele.dk/rfb5y(2)27 viva, which was blocked byCyber Patrol in the \"Adult/Sexually Explicit\" category; VisionArt Online, which sells wooden wall hangings for the home thatcontain prayers, passages from the Bible, and images of the Starof David, http://www.visionartonline.com, which was blocked inWebsense's \"Sex\" category; and the home page of Tenzin Palmo, aBuddhist nun, which contained a description of her project tobuild a Buddhist nunnery and international retreat center forwomen, http://www.tenzinpalmo.com, which was categorized as\"Nudity\" by N2H2.\n\nSeveral blocked sites also contained information aboutgovernmental entities or specific political candidates, orcontained political commentary. These included: the Web site forKelley Ross, a Libertarian candidate for the California StateAssembly, http://www.friesian.com/ross/ca40, which N2H2blocked as \"Nudity\"; the Web site for Bob Coughlin, a townselectman in Dedham, Massachusetts,http://www.bobcoughlin.org, which was blocked under N2H2's\"Nudity\" category; a list of Web sites containing informationabout government and politics in Adams County, Pennsylvania,http://www.geocities.com/adamscopa, which was blocked byWebsense as \"Sex\"; the Web site for Wisconsin Right to Life,http://www.wrtl.org, Which N2H2 blocked as \"Nudity\"; a Website that promotes federalism in Uganda, http://federo.com,which N2H2 blocked as \"Adults Only, Pornography\"; \"Fight theDeath Penalty in the USA,\" a Danish Web site dedicated tocriticizing the American system of capital punishment,http://www.fdp.dk, which N2H2 blocked as \"Pornography\"; and\"Dumb Laws,\" a humor Web site that makes fun of outmoded laws,http://www.dumblaws.com, which N2H2 blocked under its \"Sex\"category.\n\nErroneously blocked Web sites relating to health issuesincluded the following: a guide to allergies,http://www.x-sitez.com/allergy, which was categorized as\"Adults Only, Pornography\" by N2H2; a health question and answersite sponsored by Columbia University,http://www.goaskalice.com.columbia.edu, which was blocked as\"Sex\" by N2H2, and as \"Mature\" by Smartfilter;\" the WesternAmputee Support Alliance Home Page,http://www.usinter.net/wasa, which wasblocked by N2H2 as \"Pornography\"; the Web site of theWillis-Knighton Cancer Center, a Shreveport, Louisiana cancertreatment facility, http://cancerftr.wkmc.com, which wasblocked by Websense under the \"Sex\" category; and a site dealingwith halitosis, http://www.dreamcastle.com/tungs, which wasblocked by N2H2 as \"Adults, Pornography,\" by Smartfilter as\"Sex,\" by Cyber Patrol as \"Adult/Sexually Explicit,\" and byWebsense as \"Adult Content.\n\nThe filtering programs also erroneously blocked several Websites having to do with education and careers. The filteringprograms blocked two sites that provide information on homeschooling. \"HomeEduStation — the Internet Source for HomeEducation,\" http://www.perigee.net/mcmullen/homedustation/,was categorized by Cyber Patrol as \"Adult/Sexually Explicit.\"Smartfilter blocked \"Apricot: A Web site made by and for homeschoolers,\" http://apricotpie.com, as \"Sex.\" The programs alsomiscategorized several career-related sites. \"Social WorkSearch,\" http://www.socialworksearch.com/, is a directory forsocial workers that Cyber Patrol placed in its \"Adult/SexuallyExplicit\" category. The \"Gay and Lesbian Chamber of SouthernNevada,\" http://www.lambdalv.com, \"a forum for the businesscommunity to develop relationships within the Las Vegas lesbian,gay, transsexual, and bisexual community\" was blocked by N2H2 as\"Adults Only, Pornography.\" A site for aspiring dentists,http://www.vvm.com/bond/home.htm, was blocked by Cyber Patrolin its \"Adult/Sexually Explicit\" category.\n\nThe filtering programs erroneously blocked many travel Websites, including: the Web site for the Allen Farmhouse Bed \u0026Breakfast of Alleghany County, North Carolina,http://planetnc.com/Beth/index.html, which Websense blockedas \"Adult Content\"; Odysseus Gay Travel, a travel companyserving gay men, http://www.odyusa.com, which N2H2categorized as \"Adults Only, Pornography\"; Southern Alberta FlyFishing Outfitters, http://albertaflyfish.com, which N2H2blocked as \"Pornography\"; and \"Nature and Culture ConsciousTravel,\" a tour operator in Namibia,http://www.trans-namibiatours.com, which was categorized as\"Pornography\" by N2H2.\n\nThe filtering programs also miscategorized a large number ofsports Web sites. These included: a site devoted to WillieO'Ree, the first African American player in the National HockeyLeague, http://www.missioncreep.com/mw/oree.html, whichWebsense blocked under its \"Nudity\" category; the home page ofthe Sydney University Australian Football Club,http://www.tek.com.au/suafc, which N2H2 blocked as \"AdultsOnly, Pornography,\" Smartfilter blocked as \"Sex,\" Cyber Patrolblocked as \"Adult/Sexually Explicit\" and Websense blocked as\"Sex\"; and a fan's page devoted to the Toronto Maple Leafshockey team, http://www.torontomapleleafs.atmypage.com,which N2H2 blocked under the \"Pornography\" category.\n\n7. Conclusion: The Effectiveness of Filtering Programs\n\nPublic libraries have adopted a variety of means of dealingwith problems created by the provision of Internet access. Thelarge amount of sexually explicit speech that is freelyavailable on the Internet has, to varying degrees, led to patroncomplaints about such matters as unsought exposure to offensivematerial, incidents of staff and patron harassment byindividuals viewing sexually explicit content on theInternet, and the use of library computers to access illegalmaterial, such as child pornography. In some libraries, youthfullibrary patrons have persistently attempted to use the Internetto access hardcore pornography.\n\nThose public libraries that have responded to these problemsby using software filters have found such filters to provide arelatively effective means of preventing patrons from accessingsexually explicit material on the Internet. Nonetheless, out ofthe entire universe of speech on the Internet falling within thefiltering products' category definitions, the filters willincorrectly fail to block a substantial amount of speech. Thus,software filters have not completely eliminated the problemsthat public libraries have sought to address by using thefilters, as evidenced by frequent instances of underblocking.Nor is there any quantitative evidence of the relativeeffectiveness of filters and the alternatives to filters thatare also intended to prevent patrons from accessing illegalcontent on the Internet.\n\nEven more importantly (for this case), although softwarefilters provide a relatively cheap and effective, albeitimperfect, means for public libraries to prevent patrons fromaccessing speech that falls within the filters' categorydefinitions, we find that commercially available filteringprograms erroneously block a huge amount of speech that isprotected by the First Amendment. Any currently availablefiltering product that is reasonably effective in preventingusers from accessing content within the filter's categorydefinitions will necessarily block countless thousands of Webpages, the content of which does not match the filteringcompany's category definitions, much less the legal definitionsof obscenity, child pornography, or harmful to minors. EvenFinnell, an expert witness for the defendants, found thatbetween 6% and 15% of the blocked Web sites in the publiclibraries that he analyzed did not contain content that meetseven the filtering products' own definitions of sexuallyexplicit content, let alone CIPA's definitions.\n\nThis phenomenon occurs for a number of reasons explicated inthe more detailed findings of fact supra. These includelimitations on filtering companies' ability to: (1) harvest Webpages for review; (2) review and categorize the Web pages thatthey have harvested; and (3) engage in regular re-review of theWeb pages that they have previously reviewed. The primarylimitations on filtering companies' ability to harvest Web pagesfor review is that a substantial majority of pages on the Webare not indexable using the spidering technology that Web searchengines use, and that together, search engines have indexed onlyaround half of the Web pages that are theoretically indexable.The fast rate of growth in the number of Web pages also limitsfiltering companies' ability to harvest pages for review. Theseshortcomings necessarily result in significant underblocking.\n\nSeveral limitations on filtering companies' ability to reviewand categorize the Web pages that they have harvested alsocontribute to over- and underblocking. First, automated reviewprocesses, even those based on \"artificial intelligence,\" areunable with any consistency to distinguish accurately materialthat falls within a category definition from material that doesnot. Moreover, human review of URLs is hampered by filteringcompanies' limited staff sizes, and by human error ormisjudgment. In order to deal with the vast size of the Web andits rapid rates of growth and change, filtering companies engagein several practices that are necessary to reduce underblocking,but inevitably result in overblocking. These include:(1) blocking whole Web sites even when only a small minority oftheir pages contain material that would fit under one of thefiltering company's categories (e.g., blocking the Salon.comsite because it contains a sex column); (2) blocking by IPaddress (because a single IP address may contain many differentWeb sites and many thousands of pages of heterogenous content);and (3) blocking loophole sites such as translator sites andcache sites, which archive Web pages that have been removed fromthe Web by their original publisher.\n\nFinally, filtering companies' failure to engage in regularre-review of Web pages that they have already categorized (orthat they have determined do not fall into any category) resultsin a substantial amount of over- and underblocking. For example,Web publishers change the contents of Web pages frequently. Theproblem also arises when a Web site goes out of existence andits domain name or IP address is reassigned to a new Web sitepublisher. In that case, a filtering company's previouscategorization of the IP address or domain name would likely beincorrect, potentially resulting in the over- or underblockingof many thousands of pages.\n\nThe inaccuracies that result from these limitations offiltering technology are quite substantial. At least tens ofthousands of pages of the indexable Web are overblocked by eachof the filtering programs evaluated by experts in this case,even when considered against the filtering companies' owncategory definitions. Many erroneously blocked pages containcontent that is completely innocuous for both adults and minors,and that no rational person could conclude matches the filteringcompanies' category definitions, such as \"pornography\" or \"sex.\"\n\nThe number of overblocked sites is of course much higher withrespect to the definitions of obscenity and child pornographythat CIPA employs for adults, since the filtering products'category definitions, such as \"sex\" and \"nudity,\" encompass vastamounts of Web pages that are neither child pornography norobscene. Thus, the number of pages of constitutionally protectedspeech blocked by filtering products far exceeds the manythousands of pages that are overblocked by reference to thefiltering products' category definitions.\n\nNo presently conceivable technology can make the judgmentsnecessary to determine whether a visual depiction fits the legaldefinitions of obscenity, child pornography, or harmful tominors. Given the state of the art in filtering and imagerecognition technology, and the rapidly changing and expandingnature of the Web, we find that filtering products' shortcomingswill not be solved through a technical solution in theforeseeable future.\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e19\u003c/span\u003eIn sum, filtering products are currently unable to block onlyvisual depictions that are obscene, child pornography, orharmful to minors (or, only content matching a filteringproduct's category definitions) while simultaneously allowingaccess to all protected speech (or, all content not matching theblocking product's category definitions). Any software filterthat is reasonably effective in blocking access to Web pagesthat fall within its category definitions will necessarilyerroneously block a substantial number of Web pages that do notfall within its category definitions.\n\nIII. Analytic Framework for the Opinion: The Centrality of Dole and the Role of the Facial Challenge\n\nBoth the plaintiffs and the government agree that, becausethis case involves a challenge to the constitutionality of theconditions that Congress has set on state actors' receipt offederal funds, the Supreme Court's decision in South Dakota v.Dole, 483 U.S. 203, 107 S.Ct. 2793, 97 L.Ed.2d 171 (1987),supplies the proper threshold analytic framework. Theconstitutional source of Congress's spending power is Article I,§ 8, cl. 1, which provides that \"Congress shall have Power . . .to pay the Debts and provide for the common Defence and generalWelfare of the United States.\" In Dole, the Court upheld theconstitutionality of a federal statute requiring the withholdingof federal highway funds from any state with a drinking agebelow 21. Id. at 211-12, 107 S.Ct. 2793. In sustaining theprovision's constitutionality, Dole articulated four generalconstitutional limitations on Congress's exercise of thespending power.\n\nFirst, \"the exercise of the spending power must be in pursuitof `the general welfare.'\" Id. at 207, 107 S.Ct. 2793. Second,any conditions that Congress sets on states' receipt of federalfunds must be sufficiently clear to enable recipients \"toexercise their choice knowingly, cognizant of the consequencesof their participation.\" Id. (internal quotation marks andcitation omitted). Third, the conditions on the receipt offederal funds must bear some relation to the purpose of thefunding program. Id. And finally, \"other constitutionalprovisions may provide an independent bar to the conditionalgrant of federal funds.\" Id. at 208, 107 S.Ct. 2793. Inparticular, the spending power \"may not be used to induce theStates to engage in activities that would themselves beunconstitutional. Thus, for example, a grant of federal fundsconditioned on invidiously discriminatory state action or theinfliction of cruel and unusual punishment would be anillegitimate exercise of the Congress' broad spending power.\"Id. at 210, 107 S.Ct. 2793.\n\nPlaintiffs do not contend that CIPA runs afoul of the firstthree limitations. However, they do allege that CIPA isunconstitutional under the fourth prong of Dole because itwill induce public libraries to violate the FirstAmendment.\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e20\u003c/span\u003e Plaintiffs therefore submit that the FirstAmendment \"provide[s] an independent bar to the conditionalgrant of federal funds\" created by CIPA. Id. at 208, 107 S.Ct.2793. More specifically, they argue that by conditioning publiclibraries' receipt of federal funds on the use of softwarefilters, CIPA will induce public libraries to violate the FirstAmendmentrights of Internet content-providers to disseminateconstitutionally protected speech to library patrons via theInternet, and the correlative First Amendment rights of publiclibrary patrons to receive constitutionally protected speech onthe Internet.\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e21\u003c/span\u003e\n\nThe government concedes that under the Dole framework, CIPAis facially invalid if its conditions will induce publiclibraries to violate the First Amendment. The government and theplaintiffs disagree, however, on the meaning of Dole's\"inducement\" requirement in the context of a First Amendmentfacial challenge to the conditions that Congress places on stateactors' receipt of federal funds. The government contends thatbecause plaintiffs are bringing a facial challenge, they mustshow that under no circumstances is it possible for a publiclibrary to comply with CIPA's conditions without violating theFirst Amendment. The plaintiffs respond that even if it ispossible for some public libraries to comply with CIPA withoutviolating the First Amendment, CIPA is facially invalid if it\"will result in the impermissible suppression of a substantialamount of protected speech.\"\n\nBecause it was clear in Dole that the states could complywith the challenged conditions that Congress attached to thereceipt of federal funds without violating the Constitution, theDole Court did not have occasion to explain fully what itmeans for Congress to use the spending power to \"induce[recipients] to engage in activities that would themselves beunconstitutional.\" Dole, 483 U.S. at 210, 107 S.Ct. 2793; seeid. at 211, 107 S.Ct. 2793 (\"Were South Dakota to succumb tothe blandishments offered by Congress and raise its drinking ageto 21, the State's action in so doing would not violate theconstitutional rights of anyone.\"). Although the propositionthat Congress may not pay state actors to violate citizens'First Amendment rights is unexceptionable when stated in theabstract, it is unclear what exactly a litigant must establishto facially invalidate an exercise of Congress's spending poweron this ground.\n\nIn general, it is well-established that a court may sustain afacial challenge to a statute only if the plaintiff demonstratesthat the statute admits of no constitutional application. SeeUnited States v. Salerno, 481 U.S. 739, 745, 107 S.Ct. 2095, 95L.Ed.2d 697 (1987) (\"A facial challenge to a legislative Act is,of course, the most difficult challenge to mount successfully,since the challenger must establish that no set of circumstancesexists under which the Act would be valid.\"); see also Bowen v.Kendrick, 487 U.S. 589, 612, 108 S.Ct. 2562, 101 L.Ed.2d 520(1988) (\"It has not been the Court's practice, in consideringfacial challenges to statutes of this kind, to strike them downin anticipation that particular applications may result inunconstitutional use of funds.\") (internal quotation marks andcitation omitted).\n\nFirst Amendment overbreadth doctrine creates a limitedexception to this rule by permitting facial invalidation of astatutethat burdens a substantial amount of protected speech, even ifthe statute may be constitutionally applied in particularcircumstances. \"The Constitution gives significant protectionfrom overbroad laws that chill speech within the FirstAmendment's vast and privileged sphere. Under this principle, [alaw] is unconstitutional on its face if it prohibits asubstantial amount of protected expression.\" Ashcroft v. FreeSpeech Coalition, ___ U.S. ___, 122 S.Ct. 1389, 1399, 152L.Ed.2d 403 (2002); see also Broadrick v. Oklahoma,413 U.S. 601, 612, 93 S.Ct. 2908, 37 L.Ed.2d 830 (1973). This moreliberal test of a statute's facial validity under the FirstAmendment stems from the recognition that where a statute'sreach contemplates a number of both constitutional andunconstitutional applications, the law's sanctions may deterindividuals from challenging the law's validity by engaging inconstitutionally protected speech that may nonetheless beproscribed by the law. Without an overbreadth doctrine, \"thecontours of regulation would have to be hammered out case bycase — and tested only by those hardy enough to risk criminalprosecution to determine the proper scope of regulation.\"Dombrowski v. Pfister, 380 U.S. 479, 487, 85 S.Ct. 1116, 14L.Ed.2d 22 (1965); see also Brockett v. Spokane Arcades, Inc.,472 U.S. 491, 503, 105 S.Ct. 2794, 86 L.Ed.2d 394 (1985) (\"[A]nindividual whose own speech or expressive conduct may validly beprohibited or sanctioned is permitted to challenge a statute onits face because it also threatens others not before the court —those who desire to engage in legally protected expression butwho may refrain from doing so rather than risk prosecution orundertake to have the law declared partially invalid.\").\n\nPlaintiffs argue that the overbreadth doctrine is applicablehere, since CIPA \"threatens to chill free speech — because itwill censor a substantial amount of protected speech, because itis vague, and because the law creates a prior restraint. . . .\"Unlike the statutes typically challenged as facially overbroad,however, CIPA does not impose criminal penalties on those whoviolate its conditions. Cf. Free Speech Coalition, ___ U.S. at___, 122 S.Ct. at 1398 (\"With these severe penalties in force,few legitimate movie producers or book publishers, or few otherspeakers in any capacity, would risk distributing images in ornear the uncertain reach of this law.\"). Thus, the rationale forpermitting facial challenges to laws that may beconstitutionally applied in some instances is less compelling incases such as this, which involve challenges to Congress'sexercise of the spending power, than in challenges to criminalstatutes.\n\nNonetheless, \"even minor punishments can chill protectedspeech,\" id., and absent the ability to challenge CIPA on itsface, public libraries that depend on federal funds may decideto comply with CIPA's terms, thereby denying patrons access tosubstantial amounts of constitutionally protected speech, ratherthan refusing to comply with CIPA's terms and consequentlylosing the benefits of federal funds. See47 C.F.R. § 54.520(e)(1) (\"A school or library that knowingly fails toensure the use of computers in accordance with thecertifications required by this section, must reimburse anyfunds and discounts received under the federal universal supportservice support mechanism for schools and libraries for theperiod in which there was noncompliance.\"). Even in cases wherethe only penalty for failure to comply with a statute is thewithholding of federal funds, the Court has sustained facialchallenges to Congress's exercise of the spending power. See,e.g., Legal Servs. Corp. v. Velazquez, 531 U.S. 533, 121 S.Ct.1043, 149 L.Ed.2d 63 (2001) (declaring unconstitutional on itsface afederal statute restricting the ability of legal servicesproviders who receive federal funds to engage in activityprotected by the First Amendment).\n\nThe Court's unconstitutional conditions cases, such asVelazquez, are not strictly controlling, since they do notrequire a showing that recipients who comply with the conditionsattached to federal funding will, as state actors, violateothers' constitutional rights, as is the case under the fourthprong of Dole. However, they are highly instructive.\n\nThe Supreme Court's pronouncements in the unconstitutionalconditions cases on what is necessary for a plaintiff to mount asuccessful First Amendment facial challenge to an exercise ofCongress's spending power have not produced a seamless web. Forexample, in Rust v. Sullivan, 500 U.S. 173, 111 S.Ct. 1759,114 L.Ed.2d 233 (1991), the Court rejected a First Amendmentfacial challenge to federal regulations prohibiting federallyfunded healthcare clinics from providing counseling concerningthe use of abortion as a method of family planning, explainingthat:\n\nPetitioners are challenging the facial validity of the regulations. Thus, we are concerned only with the question whether, on their face, the regulations are both authorized by the Act and can be construed in such a manner that they can be applied to a set of individuals without infringing upon constitutionally protected rights. Petitioners face a heavy burden in seeking to have the regulations invalidated as facially unconstitutional. . . . The fact that the regulations might operate unconstitutionally under some conceivable set of circumstances is insufficient to render them wholly invalid.\n\nId. at 183, 111 S.Ct. 1759 (internal quotation marks,alterations, and citation omitted). In contrast, NEA v.Finley, 524 U.S. 569, 118 S.Ct. 2168, 141 L.Ed.2d 500 (1998),which also involved a facial First Amendment challenge to anexercise of Congress's spending power, articulated a somewhatmore liberal test of facial validity than Rust, explainingthat \"[t]o prevail, respondents must demonstrate a substantialrisk that application of the provision will lead to thesuppression of speech.\" Id. at 580, 118 S.Ct. 2168.\n\nAgainst this background, it is unclear to us whether, tosucceed in facially invalidating CIPA on the grounds that itwill \"induce the States to engage in activities that wouldthemselves be unconstitutional,\" Dole, 483 U.S. at 210, 107S.Ct. 2793, plaintiffs must show that it is impossible forpublic libraries to comply with CIPA's conditions withoutviolating the First Amendment, or rather simply that CIPA willeffectively restrict library patrons' access to substantialamounts of constitutionally protected speech, therefore causingmany libraries to violate the First Amendment. However, we neednot resolve this issue. Rather, we may assume without deciding,for purposes of this case, that a facial challenge to CIPArequires plaintiffs to show that any public library thatcomplies with CIPA's conditions will necessarily violate theFirst Amendment and, as explained in detail below, we believethat CIPA's constitutionality fails even under this morerestrictive test of facial validity urged on us by thegovernment. Because of the inherent limitations in filteringtechnology, public libraries can never comply with CIPA withoutblocking access to a substantial amount of speech that is bothconstitutionally protected and fails to meet even the filteringcompanies' own blocking criteria. We turn first to the governinglegal principles to be applied to the facts in order todetermine whether the First Amendment permits a library to usethe filtering technology mandated by CIPA.\n\nIV. Level of Scrutiny Applicable to Content-based Restrictions on Internet Access in Public Libraries\n\nIn analyzing the constitutionality of a public library's useof Internet filtering software, we must first identify theappropriate level of scrutiny to apply to this restriction onpatrons' access to speech. While plaintiffs argue that a publiclibrary's use of such filters is subject to strict scrutiny, thegovernment maintains that the applicable standard is rationalbasis review. If strict scrutiny applies, the government mustshow that the challenged restriction on speech is narrowlytailored to promote a compelling government interest and that noless restrictive alternative would further that interest.United States v. Playboy Entm't Group, Inc., 529 U.S. 803,813, 120 S.Ct. 1878, 146 L.Ed.2d 865 (2000). In contrast, underrational basis review, the challenged restriction need only bereasonable; the government interest that the restriction servesneed not be compelling; the restriction need not be narrowlytailored to serve that interest; and the restriction \"need notbe the most reasonable or the only reasonable limitation.\"Cornelius v. NAACP Legal Def. \u0026 Educ. Fund, 473 U.S. 788, 808,105 S.Ct. 3439, 87 L.Ed.2d 567 (1985).\n\nSoftware filters, by definition, block access to speech on thebasis of its content, and content-based restrictions on speechare generally subject to strict scrutiny. See Playboy, 529U.S. at 813, 120 S.Ct. 1878 (\"[A] content-based speechrestriction . . . can stand only if it satisfies strictscrutiny.\"). Strict scrutiny does not necessarily apply tocontent-based restrictions on speech, however, where therestrictions apply only to speech on government property, suchas public libraries. \"[I]t is . . . well settled that thegovernment need not permit all forms of speech on property thatit owns and controls.\" Int'l Soc'y for Krishna Consciousness,Inc. v. Lee, 505 U.S. 672, 678 (1992). We perforce turn to adiscussion of public forum doctrine.\n\nA. Overview of Public Forum Doctrine\n\nThe government's power to restrict speech on its own propertyis not unlimited. Rather, under public forum doctrine, theextent to which the First Amendment permits the government torestrict speech on its own property depends on the character ofthe forum that the government has created. See Cornelius v.NAACP Legal Def. \u0026 Educ. Fund, Inc., 473 U.S. 788, 105 S.Ct.3439, 87 L.Ed.2d 567 (1985). Thus, the First Amendment affordsgreater deference to restrictions on speech in those areasconsidered less amenable to free expression, such as militarybases, see Greer v. Spock, 424 U.S. 828, 96 S.Ct. 1211, 47L.Ed.2d 505 (1976), jail grounds, see Adderley v. Florida,385 U.S. 39, 87 S.Ct. 242, 17 L.Ed.2d 149 (1966), or public airportterminals, see Int'l Soc'y for Krishna Consciousness, Inc. v.Lee, 505 U.S. 672, 112 S.Ct. 2701, 120 L.Ed.2d 541 (1992), thanto restrictions on speech in state universities, seeRosenberger v. Rector \u0026 Visitors of Univ. of Va., 515 U.S. 819,115 S.Ct. 2510, 132 L.Ed.2d 700 (1995), or streets, sidewalksand public parks, see Frisby v. Schultz, 487 U.S. 474, 108S.Ct. 2495, 101 L.Ed.2d 420 (1988); Hague v. CIO,307 U.S. 496, 59 S.Ct. 954, 83 L.Ed. 1423 (1939).\n\nThe Supreme Court has identified three types of fora forpurposes of identifying the level of First Amendment scrutinyapplicable to content-based restrictions on speech on governmentproperty: traditional public fora, designated public fora, andnonpublic fora. Traditional public fora include sidewalks,squares, and public parks:\n\n[S]treets and parks . . . have immemorially been held in trust for the use of the public and, time out of mind, have been used for purposes of assembly, communicating thoughts between citizens, and discussing public questions. Such use of the streets and public places has, from ancient times, been a part of the privileges, immunities, rights, and liberties of citizens.\n\nHague, 307 U.S. at 515, 59 S.Ct. 954. \"In these quintessentialpublic forums, . . . [f]or the State to enforce a content-basedexclusion it must show that its regulation is necessary to servea compelling state interest and that it is narrowly drawn toachieve that end.\" Perry Educ. Ass'n v. Perry Local Educs.Ass'n, 460 U.S. 37, 45, 103 S.Ct. 948, 74 L.Ed.2d 794 (1983);see also Int'l Soc'y for Krishna Consciousness, 505 U.S. at678, 112 S.Ct. 2701 (\"[R]egulation of speech on governmentproperty that has traditionally been available for publicexpression is subject to the highest scrutiny.\"); Frisby, 487U.S. at 480, 108 S.Ct. 2495 (\"[W]e have repeatedly referred topublic streets as the archetype of a traditional publicforum.\").\n\nA second category of fora, known as designated (or limited)public fora, \"consists of public property which the State hasopened for use by the public as a place for expressiveactivity.\" Perry, 460 U.S. at 46, 103 S.Ct. 948. Whereas anycontent-based restriction on the use of traditional public forais subject to strict scrutiny, the state is generally permitted,as long as it does not discriminate on the basis of viewpoint,to limit a designated public forum to certain speakers or thediscussion of certain subjects. See Perry, 460 U.S. at 45 n.7, 103 S.Ct. 948. Once it has defined the limits of a designatedpublic forum, however, \"[r]egulation of such property is subjectto the same limitations as that governing a traditional publicforum.\" Int'l Soc'y for Krishna Consciousness, 505 U.S. at678, 112 S.Ct. 2701. Examples of designated fora includeuniversity meeting facilities, see Widmar v. Vincent,454 U.S. 263, 102 S.Ct. 269, 70 L.Ed.2d 440 (1981), school boardmeetings, see City of Madison Joint School Dist. v. Wisc.Employment Relations Comm'n, 429 U.S. 167, 97 S.Ct. 421, 50L.Ed.2d 376 (1976), and municipal theaters, see SoutheasternPromotions, Ltd. v. Conrad, 420 U.S. 546, 95 S.Ct. 1239, 43L.Ed.2d 448 (1975).\n\nThe third category, nonpublic fora, consists of all remainingpublic property. \"Limitations on expressive activity conductedon this last category of property must survive only a much morelimited review. The challenged regulation need only bereasonable, as long as the regulation is not an effort tosuppress the speaker's activity due to disagreement with thespeaker's view.\" Int'l Soc'y for Krishna Consciousness, 505U.S. at 679, 112 S.Ct. 2701.\n\nB. Contours of the Relevant Forum: the Library's Collection as a Whole or the Provision of Internet Access?\n\nTo apply public forum doctrine to this case, we must firstdetermine whether the appropriate forum for analysis is thelibrary's collection as a whole, which includes both print andelectronic resources, or the library's provision of Internetaccess. Where a plaintiff seeks limited access, for expressivepurposes, to governmentally controlled property, the SupremeCourt has held that the relevant forum is defined not by thephysical limits of the government property at issue, but ratherby the specific access that the plaintiff seeks:\n\nAlthough . . . as an initial matter a speaker must seek access to public property or to private property dedicated to public use to evoke First Amendment concerns, forum analysis is not completed merely by identifying the government property at issue. Rather, in defining the forum we have focused on the access sought by the speaker. When speakers seek general access to public property, the forum encompasses that property. In cases in which limited access is sought, our cases have taken a more tailored approach to ascertaining the perimeters of a forum within the confines of the government property.\n\nCornelius v. NAACP Legal Def. \u0026 Educ. Fund, Inc.,473 U.S. 788, 801, 105 S.Ct. 3439, 87 L.Ed.2d 567 (1985).\n\nThus, in Cornelius, where the plaintiffs were legal defenseand political advocacy groups seeking to participate in theCombined Federal Campaign charity drive, the Court held that therelevant forum, for First Amendment purposes, was not the entirefederal workplace, but rather the charity drive itself. Id. at801, 105 S.Ct. 3439. Similarly, in Perry Education Associationv. Perry Local Educators' Association, 460 U.S. 37, 103 S.Ct.948, 74 L.Ed.2d 794 (1983), which addressed a union's right toaccess a public school's internal mail system and teachers'mailboxes, the Court identified the relevant forum as theschool's mail system, not the public school as a whole. InWidmar v. Vincent, 454 U.S. 263, 102 S.Ct. 269, 70 L.Ed.2d 440(1981), in which a student group challenged a state university'srestrictions on use of its meeting facilities, the Courtidentified the relevant forum as the meeting facilities to whichthe plaintiffs sought access, not the state universitygenerally. And in Christ's Bride Ministries, Inc. v. SEPTA,148 F.3d 242 (3d Cir. 1998), involving a First Amendmentchallenge to the removal of advertisements from subway andcommuter rail stations, the Third Circuit noted that the forumat issue was not the rail and subway stations as a whole, butrather the advertising space within the stations. Id. at 248.Although these cases dealt with the problem of identifying therelevant forum where speakers are claiming a right of access,we believe that the same approach applies to identifying therelevant forum where the parties seeking access are listeners orreaders.\n\nIn this case, the patron plaintiffs are not asserting a FirstAmendment right to compel public libraries to acquire certainbooks or magazines for their print collections. Nor are the Website plaintiffs claiming a First Amendment right to compelpublic libraries to carry print materials that they publish.Rather, the right at issue in this case is the specific right oflibrary patrons to access information on the Internet, and thespecific right of Web publishers to provide library patrons withinformation via the Internet. Thus, the relevant forum foranalysis is not the library's entire collection, which includesboth print and electronic media, such as the Internet, butrather the specific forum created when the library provides itspatrons with Internet access.\n\nAlthough a public library's provision of Internet access doesnot resemble the conventional notion of a forum as awell-defined physical space, the same First Amendment standardsapply. See Rosenberger v. Rector \u0026 Visitors of Univ. of Va.,515 U.S. 819, 830, 115 S.Ct. 2510, 132 L.Ed.2d 700 (1995)(holding that a state university's student activities fund \"is aforum more in a metaphysical than a spatial or geographic sense,but the same principles are applicable\"); see also Cornelius,473 U.S. at 801, 105 S.Ct. 3439 (identifying the CombinedFederal Campaign charity drive as the relevant unit of analysisfor application of public forum doctrine).\n\nC. Content-based Restrictions in Designated Public Fora\n\nUnlike nonpublic fora such as airport terminals, see Int'lSoc'y for KrishnaConsciousness, Inc. v. Lee, 505 U.S. 672, 112 S.Ct. 2701, 120L.Ed.2d 541 (1992), military bases, see Greer v. Spock,424 U.S. 828, 96 S.Ct. 1211, 47 L.Ed.2d 505 (1976), jail grounds,see Adderley v. Florida, 385 U.S. 39, 87 S.Ct. 242, 17 L.Ed.2d149 (1966), the federal workplace, see Cornelius v. NAACP LegalDef. \u0026 Educ. Fund, 473 U.S. 788, 805, 105 S.Ct. 3439, 87L.Ed.2d 567 (1985), and public transit vehicles, see Lehman v.City of Shaker Heights, 418 U.S. 298, 94 S.Ct. 2714, 41 L.Ed.2d770 (1974), the purpose of a public library in general, and theprovision of Internet access within a public library inparticular, is \"for use by the public . . . for expressiveactivity,\" Perry Educ. Ass'n v. Perry Local Educs. Ass'n,460 U.S. 37, 45, 103 S.Ct. 948, 74 L.Ed.2d 794 (1983), namely, thedissemination and receipt by the public of a wide range ofinformation. We are satisfied that when the government providesInternet access in a public library, it has created a designatedpublic forum. See Mainstream Loudoun v. Bd. of Trustees of theLoudoun County Library, 24 F. Supp.2d 552, 563 (E.D.Va. 1998);cf. Kreimer v. Bureau of Police, 958 F.2d 1242, 1259 (3d Cir.1992) (holding that a public library is a limited public forum).\n\nRelying on those cases that have recognized that governmenthas leeway, under the First Amendment, to limit use of adesignated public forum to narrowly specified purposes, and thatcontent-based restrictions on speech that are consistent withthose purposes are subject only to rational basis review, thegovernment argues for application of rational basis review topublic libraries' decisions about which content to makeavailable to their patrons via the Internet. See Rosenberger,515 U.S. 819, 829, 115 S.Ct. 2510, 132 L.Ed.2d 700 (1995) (\"Thenecessities of confining a forum to the limited and legitimatepurposes for which it was created may justify the State inreserving it for certain groups or for the discussion of certaintopics.\"); Perry, 460 U.S. at 46 n. 7, 103 S.Ct. 948 (1983)(\"A public forum may be created for a limited purpose such asuse by certain groups . . . or for the discussion of certainsubjects.\").\n\nIn particular, the government forcefully argues that a publiclibrary's decision to limit the content of its digital offeringson the Internet should be subject to no stricter scrutiny thanits decisions about what content to make available to itspatrons through the library's print collection. According to thegovernment, just as a public library may choose to acquire booksabout gardening but not golf, without having to show that thiscontent-based restriction on patrons' access to speech isnarrowly tailored to further a compelling state interest, so maya public library make contentbased decisions about which speechto make available on the Internet, without having to show thatsuch a restriction satisfies strict scrutiny.\n\nPlaintiffs respond that the government's ability to restrictthe content of speech in a designated public forum byrestricting the purpose of the designated public forum that itcreates is not unlimited. Cf. Legal Servs. Corp. v. Velazquez,531 U.S. 533, 547, 121 S.Ct. 1043, 149 L.Ed.2d 63 (2001)(\"Congress cannot recast a condition on funding as a meredefinition of its program in every case, lest the FirstAmendment be reduced to a simple semantic exercise.\"). AsJustice Kennedy has explained:\n\nIf Government has a freer hand to draw content-based distinctions in limiting a forum than in excluding someone from it, the First Amendment would be a dead letter in designated public forums; every exclusion could be recast as a limitation. . . . The power to limit or redefine forums for a specific legitimate purpose does not allow the government to exclude certain speech or speakers from them for any reason at all.\n\nDenver Area Telecomm. Consortium, Inc. v. FCC, 518 U.S. 727,801, 116 S.Ct. 2374, 135 L.Ed.2d 888 (1996) (Kennedy, J.,concurring in the judgment).\n\nAlthough we agree with plaintiffs that the First Amendmentimposes some limits on the state's ability to adopt contentbasedrestrictions in defining the purpose of a public forum,precisely what those limits are is unclear, and presents adifficult problem in First Amendment jurisprudence. The SupremeCourt's \"cases have not yet determined . . . that government'sdecision to dedicate a public forum to one type of content oranother is necessarily subject to the highest level of scrutiny.Must a local government, for example, show a compelling stateinterest if it builds a band shell in the park and dedicates itsolely to classical music (but not to jazz)? The answer is notobvious.\" Denver, 518 U.S. at 750, 116 S.Ct. 2374 (pluralityopinion); see also Southeastern Promotions, Ltd. v. Conrad,420 U.S. 546, 572-73, 95 S.Ct. 1239, 43 L.Ed.2d 448 (1975)(Rehnquist, J., dissenting) (\"May an opera house limit itsproductions to operas, or must it also show rock musicals? May amunicipal theater devote an entire season to Shakespeare, or isit required to book any potential producer on a first come,first served basis?\").\n\nWe believe, however, that certain principles emerge from theSupreme Court's jurisprudence on this question. In particular,and perhaps somewhat counterintuitively, the more narrow therange of speech that the government chooses to subsidize(whether directly, through government grants or other funding,or indirectly, through the creation of a public forum) the moredeference the First Amendment accords the government in drawingcontent-based distinctions.\n\nAt one extreme lies the government's decision to fund aparticular message that the government seeks to disseminate. Inthis context, content-based restrictions on the speech thatgovernment chooses to subsidize are clearly subject to at mostrational basis review, and even viewpoint discrimination ispermissible. For example, \"[w]hen Congress established aNational Endowment for Democracy to encourage other countries toadopt democratic principles, 22 U.S.C. § 4411(b), it was notconstitutionally required to fund a program to encouragecompeting lines of political philosophy such as communism andfascism.\" Rust v. Sullivan, 500 U.S. 173, 194, 111 S.Ct. 1759,114 L.Ed.2d 233 (1991); see also Velazquez, 531 U.S. at 541,121 S.Ct. 1043 (\"[V]iewpoint-based funding decisions can besustained in instances in which the government is itself thespeaker, or in instances, like Rust, in which the governmentused private speakers to transmit information pertaining to itsown program.\") (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).\n\nAlthough not strictly controlling, the Supreme Court'sunconstitutional conditions cases, such as Rust andVelazquez, are instructive for purposes of analyzingcontent-based restrictions on the use of public fora. This isbecause the limitations that government places on the use of apublic forum can be conceptualized as conditions that thegovernment attaches to the receipt of a benefit that it offers,namely, the use of government property. Public forum cases thusresemble those unconstitutional conditions cases involving FirstAmendment challenges to the conditions that the state places onthe receipt of a government benefit. See Velazquez, 531 U.S.at 544, 121 S.Ct. 1043 (\"As this suit involves asubsidy, limited forum cases . . . may not be controlling in thestrict sense, yet they do provide some instruction.\").\n\nEven when the government does not fund the dissemination of aparticular government message, the First Amendment generallypermits government, subject to the constraints of viewpointneutrality, to create public institutions such as art museumsand state universities, dedicated to facilitating thedissemination of private speech that the government believes tohave particular merit. Thus, in NEA v. Finley, 524 U.S. 569,118 S.Ct. 2168, 141 L.Ed.2d 500 (1998), the Court upheld the useof content-based restrictions in a federal program awardinggrants to artists on the basis of, inter alia, artisticexcellence. \"The very assumption of the NEA is that grants willbe awarded according to the artistic worth of competingapplications, and absolute neutrality is simply inconceivable.\"Id. at 585, 118 S.Ct. 2168 (internal quotation marks andcitation omitted).\n\nSimilarly, as Justice Stevens explained in his concurringopinion in Widmar v. Vincent, 454 U.S. 263, 102 S.Ct. 269, 70L.Ed.2d 440 (1981), the First Amendment does not necessarilysubject to strict scrutiny a state university's use ofcontentbased means of allocating scarce resources, includinglimited public fora such as its meeting facilities:\n\nBecause every university's resources are limited, an educational institution must routinely make decisions concerning the use of the time and space that is available for extracurricular activities. In my judgment, it is both necessary and appropriate for those decisions to evaluate the content of a proposed student activity. I should think it obvious, for example, that if two groups of 25 students requested the use of a room at a particular time — one to view Mickey Mouse cartoons and the other to rehearse an amateur performance of Hamlet — the First Amendment would not require that the room be reserved for the group that submitted its application first. Nor do I see why a university should have to establish a \"compelling state interest\" to defend its decision to permit one group to use the facility and not the other.\n\nId. at 278, 102 S.Ct. 269 (Stevens, J., concurring in thejudgment).\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e22\u003c/span\u003e\n\nThe more broadly the government facilitates private speech,however, the less deference the First Amendment accords to thegovernment's content-based restrictions on the speech that itfacilitates. Thus, where the government creates a designatedpublic forum to facilitate private speech representing a diverserange of viewpoints, the government's decision selectively tosingle out particular viewpoints for exclusion is subject tostrict scrutiny. Compare Rosenberger, 515 U.S. at 834, 115S.Ct. 2510 (applying heightened First Amendment scrutiny toviewpoint-based restrictions on the use of a limited publicforum where the government \"does not itself speak or subsidizetransmittal of a message it favors but instead expends funds toencourage a diversity of views from private speakers\"), withFinley, 524 U.S. at 586, 118 S.Ct. 2168 (\"In the context ofarts funding, in contrast to many other subsidies, theGovernment does not indiscriminately encourage a diversity ofviews from private speakers.\") (internal quotation marks andcitation omitted).\n\nSimilarly, although the government may create a designatedpublic forum limited to speech on a particular topic, if thegovernment opens the forum to members of the general public tospeak on that topic while selectively singling out for exclusionparticular speakers on the basis of the content of their speech,that restriction is subject to strict scrutiny. For instance, inCity of Madison Joint School District No. 8 v. WisconsinEmployment Relations Commission, 429 U.S. 167, 97 S.Ct. 421, 50L.Ed.2d 376 (1976), the Court held that where a school boardopens its meetings for public participation, it may not,consistent with the First Amendment, prohibit teachers otherthan union representatives from speaking on the subject ofpending collective-bargaining negotiations. See id. at 175, 97S.Ct. 421 (noting that the state \"has opened a forum for directcitizen involvement\"); see also Ark. Educ. Television Comm'n v.Forbes, 523 U.S. 666, 680, 118 S.Ct. 1633, 140 L.Ed.2d 875(1998) (distinguishing, for purposes of determining theappropriate level of First Amendment scrutiny, a televiseddebate in which a public broadcasting station exerciseseditorial discretion in selecting participating candidates froma debate that has \"an open-microphone format\").\n\nFinally, content-based restrictions on speech in a designatedpublic forum are most clearly subject to strict scrutiny whenthe government opens a forum for virtually unrestricted use bythe general public for speech on a virtually unrestricted rangeof topics, while selectively excluding particular speech whosecontent it disfavors. Thus, in Conrad, the Court held that alocal government violated the First Amendment when it denied agroup seeking to perform the rock musical \"Hair\" access to ageneral-purpose municipal theater open for the public at largeto use for performances. See also Denver, 518 U.S. at 802, 116S.Ct. 2374 (Kennedy, J., concurring in the judgment) (suggestingthat strict scrutiny would not apply to a local government'sdecision to \"build[] a band shell in the park and dedicate[] itsolely to classical music (but not jazz),\" but would apply to\"the Government's creation of a band shell in which all types ofmusic might be performed except for rap music\").\n\nSimilarly, in FCC v. League of Women Voters of Cal.,468 U.S. 364, 104 S.Ct. 3106, 82 L.Ed.2d 278 (1984), the Courtsubjected to heightened scrutiny a federal program that funded awide range of public broadcasting stations that disseminatedspeech on a wide range of subjects, where the federal programsingled out for exclusion speech whose content amounted toeditorializing. As the Court later explained:\n\nIn FCC v. League of Women Voters of Cal., 468 U.S. 364, 104 S.Ct. 3106, 82 L.Ed.2d 278 (1984) the Court was instructed by its understanding of the dynamics of the broadcast industry in holding that prohibitions against editorializing by public radio networks were an impermissible restriction, even though the Government enacted the restriction to control the use of public funds. The First Amendment forbade the Government from using the forum in an unconventional way to suppress speech inherent in the nature of the medium.\n\nVelazquez, 531 U.S. at 543, 121 S.Ct. 1043.\n\nIn sum, the more widely the state opens a forum for members ofthe public to speak on a variety of subjects and viewpoints, themore vulnerable is the state's decision selectively to excludecertain speech on the basis of its disfavored content, as suchexclusions distort the marketplace of ideas that the state hascreated in establishing the forum. Cf. Velazquez, 531 U.S. at544, 121 S.Ct. 1043 (\"Restricting LSC attorneys in advisingtheir clients and in presenting arguments and analyses to thecourts distorts the legal system by altering the traditionalrole of the attorneys in much the same way broadcast systems orstudent publication networks were changed in the limited forumcases. . . .\").\n\nThus, we believe that where the state designates a forum forexpressive activity and opens the forum for speech by the publicat large on a wide range of topics, strict scrutiny applies torestrictions that single out for exclusion from the forumparticular speech whose content is disfavored. \"Laws designed orintended to suppress or restrict the expression of specificspeakers contradict basic First Amendment principles.\" UnitedStates v. Playboy Entm't Group, Inc., 529 U.S. 803, 812, 120S.Ct. 1878, 146 L.Ed.2d 865 (2000); see also Denver, 518 U.S.at 782, 116 S.Ct. 2374 (Kennedy, J., concurring in the judgment)(noting the flaw in a law that \"singles out one sort of speechfor vulnerability to private censorship in a context wherecontent-based discrimination is not otherwise permitted\").Compare Forbes, 523 U.S. at 679, 118 S.Ct. 1633 (holding thatthe state does not create a public forum when it \"allowsselective access for individual speakers rather than generalaccess for a class of speakers\") (emphasis added), with PoliceDep't of the City of Chicago v. Mosley, 408 U.S. 92, 96, 92S.Ct. 2286, 33 L.Ed.2d 212 (1972) (\"Selective exclusions froma public forum may not be based on content alone, and may not bejustified by reference to content alone.\") (emphasis added).\n\nWe note further that to the extent that the government createsa public forum expressly designed to facilitate thedissemination of private speech, opens the forum to any memberof the public to speak on any virtually any topic, and thenselectively targets certain speech for exclusion based on itscontent, the government is singling out speech in a manner thatresembles the discriminatory taxes on the press that the SupremeCourt subjected to heightened First Amendment scrutiny inArkansas Writers' Project, Inc. v. Ragland, 481 U.S. 221, 107S.Ct. 1722, 95 L.Ed.2d 209 (1987), and Minneapolis Star \u0026Tribune Co. v. Minnesota Commissioner of Revenue, 460 U.S. 575,103 S.Ct. 1365, 75 L.Ed.2d 295 (1983), which we explain in themargin.\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e23\u003c/span\u003e\n\nD. Reasons for Applying Strict Scrutiny\n\n1. Selective Exclusion From a \"Vast Democratic Forum\"\n\nApplying these principles to public libraries, we agree withthe government that generally the First Amendment subjectslibraries' content-based decisions about which print materialsto acquire for their collections to only rational review. Inmaking these decisions, public libraries are generally free toadopt collection development criteria that reflect not simplypatrons' demand for certain material, but also the library'sevaluation of the material's quality. See Bernard W. Bell,Filth, Filtering, and the First Amendment: Ruminations onPublic Libraries' Use of Internet Filtering Software, 53Fed.Comm.L.J. 191, 225 (2001) (\"Librarians should have thediscretion to decide that the library is committed tointellectual inquiry, not to the satisfaction of the full rangeof human desires.\"). Thus, a public library's decision to usethe last $100 of its budget to purchase the complete works ofShakespeare even though more of its patrons would prefer thelibrary to use the same amount to purchase the complete works ofJohn Grisham, is not, in our view, subject to strict scrutiny.Cf. NEA v. Finley, 524 U.S. 569, 118 S.Ct. 2168, 141 L.Ed.2d500 (1998) (subjecting only to rational basis review thegovernment's decision to award NEA grants on the basis of,inter alia, artistic excellence).\n\nNonetheless, we disagree with the government's argument thatpublic libraries' use of Internet filters is no different, forFirst Amendment purposes, from the editorial discretion thatthey exercise when they choose to acquire certain books on thebasis of librarians' evaluation of their quality. The centraldifference, in our view, is that by providing patrons with evenfiltered Internet access, the library permits patrons to receivespeech on a virtually unlimited number of topics, from avirtually unlimited number of speakers, without attempting torestrict patrons' access to speech that the library, in theexercise of its professional judgment, determines to beparticularly valuable. Cf. Rosenberger v. Rector \u0026 Visitors ofUniv. of Va., 515 U.S. 819, 834, 115 S.Ct. 2510, 132 L.Ed.2d700 (1995) (applying strict scrutiny to viewpoint-basedrestrictions where the state \"does not itself speak or subsidizetransmittal of a message it favors but instead expends funds toencourage a diversity of views from private speakers\"). Seegenerally supra Section IV.C.\n\nIn those cases upholding the government's exercise ofeditorial discretion in selecting certain speech forsubsidization or inclusion in a state-created forum, the stateactor exercising the editorial discretion has at least reviewedthe content of the speech that the forum facilitates. Thus, inFinley the NEA examined the content of those works of art thatit chose to subsidize, and in Arkansas Educational TelevisionCommission v. Forbes, 523 U.S. 666, 118 S.Ct. 1633, 140 L.Ed.2d875(1998), the public broadcaster specifically reviewed andapproved each speaker permitted to participate in the debate.See id. at 673, 118 S.Ct. 1633 (\"In the case of televisionbroadcasting, . . . broad rights of access for outside speakerswould be antithetical, as a general rule, to the discretion thatstations and their editorial staff must exercise to fulfilltheir journalistic purpose and statutory obligations.\");Finley, 524 U.S. at 586, 118 S.Ct. 2168 (\"The NEA's mandate isto make esthetic judgments, and the inherently content-based`excellence' threshold for NEA support sets it apart from thesubsidy at issue in Rosenberger — was available to all studentorganizations that were `related to the educational purpose ofthe University. . . .'\") (quoting Rosenberger, 515 U.S. at824, 115 S.Ct. 2510); see also Cornelius v. NAACP Legal Def. \u0026Educ. Fund, 473 U.S. 788, 804, 105 S.Ct. 3439, 87 L.Ed.2d 567(1985) (\"The Government's consistent policy has been to limitparticipation in the [Combined Federal Campaign] to`appropriate' voluntary agencies and to require agencies seekingadmission to obtain permission from federal and local Campaignofficials. . . . [T]here is no evidence suggesting that thegranting of the requisite permission is merely ministerial.\").The essence of editorial discretion requires the exercise ofprofessional judgment in examining the content that thegovernment singles out as speech of particular value.\n\nThis exercise of editorial discretion is evident in alibrary's decision to acquire certain books for its collection.As the government's experts in library science testified, inselecting a book for a library's collection, librarians evaluatethe book's quality by reference to a variety of criteria such asits accuracy, the title's niche in relation to the rest of thecollection, the authority of the author, the publisher, thework's presentation, and how it compares with other materialavailable in the same genre or on the same subject. Thus, thecontent of every book that a library acquires has been reviewedby the library's collection development staff or someone to whomthey have delegated the task, and has been judged to meet thecriteria that form the basis for the library's collectiondevelopment policy. Although some public libraries use \"approvalplans\" to delegate the collection development to third-partyvendors which provide the library with recommended materialsthat the library is then free to retain or return to the vendor,the same principle nonetheless attains.\n\nIn contrast, in providing patrons with even filtered Internetaccess, a public library invites patrons to access speech whosecontent has never been reviewed and recommended as particularlyvaluable by either a librarian or a third party to whom thelibrary has delegated collection development decisions. Althoughseveral of the government's librarian witnesses who testified attrial purport to apply the same standards that govern thelibrary's acquisition of print materials to the library'sprovision of Internet access to patrons, when public librariesprovide their patrons with Internet access, they intentionallyopen their doors to vast amounts of speech that clearly lackssufficient quality to ever be considered for the library's printcollection. Unless a library allows access to only those sitesthat have been preselected as having particular value, a methodthat, as noted above, was tried and rejected by the WestervilleOhio Public Library, see supra at 46-47, 103 S.Ct. 948, even alibrary that uses software filters has opened its Internetcollection \"for indiscriminate use by the general public.\"Perry Educ. Ass'n v. Perry Local Educs. Ass'n, 460 U.S. 37,47, 103 S.Ct. 948, 74 L.Ed.2d 794 (1983). \"[M]ost Internetforums — including chat rooms, newsgroups, mail exploders, andthe Web — are open toall comers.\" Reno v. ACLU, 521 U.S. 844, 880, 117 S.Ct. 2329,138 L.Ed.2d 874 (1997).\n\nThe fundamental difference between a library's printcollection and its provision of Internet access is illustratedby comparing the extent to which the library opens its printcollection to members of the public to speak on a given topicand the extent to which it opens its Internet terminals tomembers of the public to speak on a given topic. When a publiclibrary chooses to carry books on a selected topic, e.g.chemistry, it does not open its print collection to any memberof the public who wishes to write about chemistry. Rather, outof the myriad of books that have ever been written on chemistry,each book on chemistry that the library carries has beenreviewed and selected because the person reviewing the book, inthe exercise of his or her professional judgment, has deemed itscontent to be particularly valuable. In contrast, when a publiclibrary provides Internet access, even filtered Internet access,it has created a forum open to any member of the public whowrites about chemistry on the Internet, regardless of howunscientific the author's methods or of how patently false theauthor's conclusions are, regardless of the author's reputationor grammar, and regardless of the reviews of the scientificcommunity.\n\nNotwithstanding protestations in CIPA's legislative history tothe contrary,\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e24\u003c/span\u003e members of the general public do definethe content that public libraries make available to theirpatrons through the Internet. Any member of the public withInternet access could, through the free Web hosting servicesavailable on the Internet, tonight jot down a few musings on anysubject under the sun, and tomorrow those musings would becomepart of public libraries' online offerings and be available toany library patron who seeks them out.\n\nIn providing its patrons with Internet access, a publiclibrary creates a forum for the facilitation of speech, almostnone of which either the library's collection development staffor even the filtering companies have ever reviewed. Althoughfiltering companies review a portion of the Web in classifyingparticular sites, the portion of the Web that the filteringcompanies actually review is quite small in relation to the Webas a whole. The filtering companies' harvesting process,described in our findings of fact, is intended to identify onlya small fraction of Web sites for the filtering companies toreview. Put simply, the state cannot be said to be exercisingeditorial discretion permitted under the First Amendment when itindiscriminately facilitates private speech whose content itmakes no effort to examine. Cf. Bell, supra, at 226(\"[C]ourts should take a much more jaundiced view of librarypolicies that block Internet access to a very limited array ofsubjects than they take of library policies that reserveInternet terminals for very limited use.\").\n\nWhile the First Amendment permits the government to exerciseeditorial discretion in singling out particularly favored speechfor subsidization or inclusion in a state-created forum, webelieve that where the state provides access to a \"vastdemocratic forum[],\" Reno, 521 U.S. at 868,117 S.Ct. 2329, open to any member of the public to speak onsubjects \"as diverse as human thought,\" id. at 870, 117 S.Ct.2329, and then selectively excludes from the forum certainspeech on the basis of its content, such exclusions are subjectto strict scrutiny. These exclusions risk fundamentallydistorting the unique marketplace of ideas that public librariescreate when they open their collections, via the Internet, tothe speech of millions of individuals around the world on avirtually limitless number of subjects.\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e25\u003c/span\u003e\n\nA public library's content-based restrictions on patrons'Internet access thus resemble the content-based restrictions onspeech subsidized by the government, whether through directfunding or through the creation of a designated public forum,that the Supreme Court has subjected to strict scrutiny, asdiscussed above in Section IV.C. Although the government maysubsidize a particular message representing the government'sviewpoint without having to satisfy strict scrutiny, see Rustv. Sullivan, 500 U.S. 173, 111 S.Ct. 1759, 114 L.Ed.2d 233(1991), strict scrutiny applies to restrictions that selectivelyexclude particular viewpoints from a public forum designed tofacilitate a wide range of viewpoints, see Rosenberger v.Rector \u0026 Visitors of Univ. of Va., 515 U.S. 819, 115 S.Ct.2510, 132 L.Ed.2d 700 (1995). Similarly, although the state'sexercise of editorial discretion in selecting particularspeakers for participation in a state-sponsored forum is subjectto rational basis review, see Ark. Educ. Television Comm'n v.Forbes, 523 U.S. 666, 118 S.Ct. 1633, 140 L.Ed.2d 875 (1998),selective exclusions of particular speakers from a forumotherwise open to any member of the public to speak are subjectto strict scrutiny, see City of Madison Joint School Dist. No.8 v. Wis. Employment Relations Comm'n, 429 U.S. 167, 97 S.Ct.421, 50 L.Ed.2d 376 (1976).\n\nAnd while the government may, subject only to rational basisreview, make content-based decisions in selecting works ofartistic excellence to subsidize, see NEA v. Finley,524 U.S. 569, 118 S.Ct. 2168, 141 L.Ed.2d 500 (1998), the Supreme Courthas applied heightened scrutiny where thegovernment opens a general-purpose municipal theater for use bythe public, but selectively excludes disfavored content, seeSoutheastern Promotions, Ltd. v. Conrad, 420 U.S. 546, 95 S.Ct.1239, 43 L.Ed.2d 448 (1975), where the government facilitatesthe speech of public broadcasters on a virtually limitlessnumber of topics, but prohibits editorializing, see FCC v.League of Women Voters of Cal., 468 U.S. 364, 104 S.Ct. 3106,82 L.Ed.2d 278 (1984), and where the government funds a widerange of legal services but restricts funding recipients fromchallenging welfare laws, see Legal Servs. Corp. v. Velazquez,531 U.S. 533, 121 S.Ct. 1043, 149 L.Ed.2d 63 (2001). Similarly,where a public library opens a forum to an unlimited number ofspeakers around the world to speak on an unlimited number oftopics, strict scrutiny applies to the library's selectiveexclusions of particular speech whose content the librarydisfavors.\n\n2. Analogy to Traditional Public Fora\n\nApplication of strict scrutiny to public libraries' use ofsoftware filters, in our view, finds further support in theextent to which public libraries' provision of Internet accesspromotes First Amendment values in an analogous manner totraditional public fora, such as sidewalks and parks, in whichcontent-based restrictions on speech are always subject tostrict scrutiny. The public library, by its very nature, is\"designed for freewheeling inquiry.\" Bd. of Education v. Pico,457 U.S. 853, 915, 102 S.Ct. 2799, 73 L.Ed.2d 435 (1982)(Rehnquist, J., dissenting). As such, the library is a \"mightyresource in the free marketplace of ideas,\" Minarcini v.Strongsville City Sch. Dist., 541 F.2d 577, 582 (6th Cir.1976), and represents a \"quintessential locus of the receipt ofinformation.\" Kreimer v. Bureau of Police for Morristown,958 F.2d 1242, 1255 (3d Cir. 1992); see also Sund v. City ofWichita Falls, 121 F. Supp.2d 530, 547 (N.D.Tex. 2000) (\"Theright to receive information is vigorously enforced in thecontext of a public library. . . .\"); cf. Int'l Soc'y forKrishna Consciousness, Inc. v. Lee, 505 U.S. 672, 681, 112S.Ct. 2701, 120 L.Ed.2d 541 (1992) (\"[A] traditional publicforum is property that has as `a principal purpose . . . thefree exchange of ideas.'\") (quoting Cornelius v. NAACP LegalDef. \u0026 Educ. Fund, 473 U.S. 788, 800, 105 S.Ct. 3439, 87L.Ed.2d 567 (1985)).\n\nWe acknowledge that the provision of Internet access in apublic library does not enjoy the historical pedigree ofstreets, sidewalks, and parks as a vehicle of free expression.Nonetheless, we believe that it shares many of thecharacteristics of these traditional public fora that uniquelypromote First Amendment values and accordingly warrantapplication of strict scrutiny to any content-based restrictionon speech in these fora. Regulation of speech in streets,sidewalks, and parks is subject to the highest scrutiny notsimply by virtue of history and tradition, but also because thespeech-facilitating character of sidewalks and parks makes themdistinctly deserving of First Amendment protection. Many ofthese same speech-promoting features of the traditional publicforum appear in public libraries' provision of Internet access.\n\nFirst, public libraries, like sidewalks and parks, aregenerally open to any member of the public who wishes to receivethe speech that these fora facilitate, subject only to narrowlimitations. See Kreimer, 958 F.2d at 1260 (noting that apublic library does not retain unfettered discretion \"to choosewhom it will permit to enter the Library,\" but upholding thelibrary's right to exclude patrons who harass patrons or whoseoffensive personal hygiene precludes the library's use by otherpatrons). Moreover, like traditionalpublic fora, public libraries are funded by taxpayers andtherefore do not charge members of the public each time they usethe forum. The only direct cost to library patrons who wish toreceive information, whether via the Internet or the library'sprint collection, is the time spent reading.\n\nBy providing Internet access to millions of Americans to whomsuch access would otherwise be unavailable, public librariesplay a critical role in bridging the digital divide separatingthose with access to new information technologies from thosethat lack access. See generally National Telecommunicationsand Information Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce,Falling Through the Net: Defining the Digital Divide (1999),available athttp://www.ntia.doc.gov/ntiahome/fttn99/contents.html. Cf.Velazquez, 531 U.S. at 546, 121 S.Ct. 1043 (invalidating acontentbased restriction on the speech of federally funded legalservices corporations and noting that given the financialhardship of legal services corporations' clients, \"[t]herestriction on speech is even more problematic because in caseswhere the attorney withdraws from a representation, the clientis unlikely to find other counsel\"). Public libraries thatprovide Internet access greatly expand the educationalopportunities for millions of Americans who, as explained in themargin, would otherwise be deprived of the benefits of this newmedium.\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e26\u003c/span\u003e\n\nJust as important as the openness of a forum to listeners isits openness to speakers. Parks and sidewalks are paradigmaticloci of First Amendment values in large part because they permitspeakers to communicate with a wide audience at low cost. Onecan address members of the public in a park for little more thanthe cost of a soapbox, and one can distribute handbills on thesidewalk for little more than the cost of a pen, paper, and somephotocopies. See Martin v. City of Struthers, 319 U.S. 141,146, 63 S.Ct. 862, 87 L.Ed. 1313 (1943) (\"Door to doordistribution of circulars is essential to the poorly financedcauses of little people.\"); Laurence H. Tribe, AmericanConstitutional Law § 12-24 at 987 (2d ed. 1988) (\"The `publicforum' doctrine holds that restrictions on speech should besubject to higher scrutiny when, all other things being equal,that speech occurs in areas playing a vital role incommunication — such as in those places historically associatedwith first amendment activities, such as streets, sidewalks, andparks — especially because of how indispensable communication inthese places is to people who lack access to more elaborate (andmore costly) channels.\"); Daniel A. Farber, Free Speech withoutRomance: Public Choice and the First Amendment, 105 Harv.L.Rev.554, 574 n. 86 (1991) (noting that traditional public fora \"areoften the only place where less affluent groups and individualscan effectively express their message\"); Harry Kalven, Jr., TheConcept of the Public Forum: Cox v. Louisiana, 1965 Sup.Ct.Rev.1, 30 (\"[T]he parade, the picket, the leaflet, the sound truck,have been the media of communication exploited by those withlittle access to the more genteel means of communication.\").\n\nSimilarly, given the existence of message boards and free Webhosting services, a speaker can, via the Internet, address thepublic, including patrons of public libraries, for little morethan the cost of Internet access. As the Supreme Court explainedin Reno v. ACLU, 521 U.S. 844, 117 S.Ct. 2329, 138 L.Ed.2d 874(1997), \"the Internet can hardly be considered a `scarce'expressive commodity. It provides relatively unlimited, low-costcapacity for communication of all kinds.\" Id. at 870, 117S.Ct. 2329. Although the cost of a home computer and Internetaccess considerably exceeds the cost of a soapbox or a fewhundred photocopies, speakers wishing to avail themselves of theInternet may gain free access in schools, workplaces, or thepublic library. As Professor Lessig has explained:\n\nThe \"press\" in 1791 was not the New York Times or the Wall Street Journal. It did not comprise large organizations of private interests, with millions of readers associated with each organization. Rather, the press then was much like the Internet today. The cost of a printing press was low, the readership was slight, and anyone (within reason) could become a publisher — and in fact an extraordinary number did. When the Constitution speaks of the rights of the \"press,\" the architecture it has in mind is the architecture of the Internet.\n\nLawrence Lessig, Code 183 (1999).\n\nWhile public libraries' provision of Internet access sharesmany of the speech-promoting qualities of traditional publicfora, it also facilitates speech in ways that traditional publicfora cannot.\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e27\u003c/span\u003e In particular, whereas the architecture ofreal space limits the audience of a pamphleteer or soapboxorator to people within the speaker's immediate vicinity, theInternet renders the geography of speaker and listenerirrelevant:\n\nThrough the use of chat rooms, any person with a phone line can become a town crier with a voice that resonates farther than it could from any soapbox. Through the use of Web pages, mail exploders, and newsgroups, the same individual can become a pamphleteer.\n\nReno, 521 U.S. at 870, 117 S.Ct. 2329. By providing patronswith Internet access, public libraries in effect open theirdoors to an unlimited number of potential speakers around theworld, inviting the speech of any member of the public whowishes to communicate with library patrons via the Internet.\n\nDue to the low, costs for speakers and the irrelevance ofgeography, the volume of speech available to library patrons onthe Internet is enormous and far exceeds the volume of speechavailable to audiences in traditional public fora. See id. at868, 117 S.Ct. 2329 (referring to \"the vast democratic forums ofthe Internet\"). Indeed, as noted in our findings of fact, theWeb is estimated to contain over one billion pages, and is saidto be growing at a rate of over 1.5 million pages per day. Seeid. at 885, 117 S.Ct. 2329 (noting \"[t]he dramatic expansion ofthis new marketplace of ideas\"). This staggering volume ofcontent on the Internet \"is as diverse as human thought,\" id.at 870, 117 S.Ct. 2329, and \"is thus comparable, from thereader's viewpoint, to . . . a vast library including millionsof readily available and indexed publications,\" id. at 853,117 S.Ct. 2329. As a result of the Internet's uniquespeech-facilitating qualities, \"it is hard to find an aspiringsocial movement, new or old, of left, right, or center, withouta website, a bulletin board, and an email list.\" Kreimer,supra n. 27, at 125. \"[T]he growth of the Internet has beenand continues to be phenomenal.\" Reno, 521 U.S. at 885, 117S.Ct. 2329.\n\nThis extraordinary growth of the Internet illustrates theextent to which the Internet promotes First Amendment values inthe same way that the historical use of traditional public forafor speaking, handbilling, and protesting testifies to theireffectiveness as vehicles for free speech. Cf. Martin, 319U.S. at 145, 63 S.Ct. 862 (\"The widespread use of this method ofcommunication [door-to-door distribution of leaflets] by manygroups espousing various causes attests its major importance.\");Schneider v. State, 308 U.S. 147, 164, 60 S.Ct. 146, 84 L.Ed.155 (1939) (\"[P]amphlets have proved most effective instrumentsin the dissemination of opinion.\").\n\nThe provision of Internet access in public libraries, inaddition to sharing the speech-enhancing qualities of fora suchas streets, sidewalks, and parks, also supplies many of thespeech-enhancing properties of the postal service, which is opento the public at large as both speakers and recipients ofinformation, and provides a relatively low-cost means ofdisseminating information to a geographically dispersedaudience. See Lamont v. Postmaster Gen., 381 U.S. 301, 85S.Ct. 1493, 14 L.Ed.2d 398 (1965) (invalidating a contentbasedprior restraint on the use of the mails); see also Blount v.Rizzi, 400 U.S. 410, 91 S.Ct. 423, 27 L.Ed.2d 498 (1971)(same). Indeed, the Supreme Court's description of the postalsystem in Lamont seems equally apt as a description of theInternet today: \"the postal system . . . is now the main arterythrough which the business, social, and personal affairs of thepeople are conducted. . . .\" 381 U.S. at 305 n. 3, 85 S.Ct.1493.\n\nIn short, public libraries, by providing their patrons withaccess to the Internet, have created a public forum thatprovides any member of the public free access to informationfrom millions of speakers around the world. The uniquespeech-enhancing character of Internet use in public librariesderives from the openness of the public library to any member ofthe public seeking to receive information, and the openness ofthe Internet to any member of the public who wishes to speak. Inparticular, speakers on the Internet enjoy low barriers to entryand the ability to reach a mass audience, unhindered by theconstraints of geography.\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e28\u003c/span\u003e Moreover,just as the development of new media \"presents unique problems,which inform our assessment of the interests at stake, and whichmay justify restrictions that would be unacceptable in othercontexts,\" United States v. Playboy Entm't Group, Inc.,529 U.S. 803, 813, 120 S.Ct. 1878, 146 L.Ed.2d 865 (2000), thedevelopment of new media, such as the Internet, also presentsunique possibilities for promoting First Amendment values, whichalso inform our assessment of the interests at stake, and whichwe believe, in the context of the provision of Internet accessin public libraries, justify the application of heightenedscrutiny to content-based restrictions that might be subject toonly rational review in other contexts, such as the developmentof the library's print collection. Cf. id. at 818, 120 S.Ct.1878 (\"Technology expands the capacity to choose; and it deniesthe potential of this revolution if we assume the Government isbest positioned to make these choices for us.\").\n\nA faithful translation of First Amendment values from thecontext of traditional public fora such as sidewalks and parksto the distinctly non-traditional public forum of Internetaccess in public libraries requires, in our view, thatcontent-based restrictions on Internet access in publiclibraries be subject to the same exacting standards of FirstAmendment scrutiny as content-based restrictions on speech intraditional public fora such as sidewalks, town squares, andparks:\n\nThe architecture of the Internet, as it is right now, is perhaps the most important model of free speech since the founding. . . . Two hundred years after the framers ratified the Constitution, the Net has taught us what the First Amendment means. . . . The model for speech that the framers embraced was the model of the Internet — distributed, noncentralized, fully free and diverse.\n\nLessig, Code, at 167, 185. Indeed, \"[m]inds are not changed instreets and parks as they once were. To an increasing degree,the more significant interchanges of ideas and shaping of publicconsciousness occur in mass and electronic media.\" Denver AreaEduc. Telecomms. Consortium, Inc. v. FCC, 518 U.S. 727, 802-03,116 S.Ct. 2374, 135 L.Ed.2d 888 (1996) (Kennedy, J., concurringin the judgment).\n\nIn providing patrons with even filtered Internet access, apublic library is not exercising editorial discretion inselecting only speech of particular quality for inclusion in itscollection, as it may do when it decides to acquire printmaterials. By providing its patrons with Internet access, publiclibraries create a forum in which any member of the public mayreceive speech from anyone around the world who wishes todisseminate information over the Internet. Within this \"vastdemocratic forum[],\" Reno, 521 U.S. at 868, 117 S.Ct. 2329,which facilitates speech that is \"as diverse as human thought,\"id. at 870, 117 S.Ct. 2329, software filters single out forexclusion particular speech on the basis of its disfavoredcontent. We hold that these content-based restrictions onpatrons' access to speech are subject to strict scrutiny.\n\nV. Application of Strict Scrutiny\n\nHaving concluded that strict scrutiny applies to publiclibraries' contentbased restrictions on patrons' access tospeech on the Internet, we must next determine whether a publiclibrary's use of Internet software filters can survive strictscrutiny. To survive strict scrutiny, a restriction on speech\"must be narrowly tailored to promote a compelling Governmentinterest. If a less restrictive alternative would serve theGovernment's purpose, the legislature must use thatalternative.\" United States v. Playboy Entm't Group, Inc.,529 U.S. 803, 813, 120 S.Ct. 1878, 146 L.Ed.2d 865 (2000) (citationomitted); see also Fabulous Assocs., Inc. v. Pa. Pub. Util.Comm'n, 896 F.2d 780, 787 (3d Cir. 1990) (holding that acontent-based burden on speech is permissible \"only if [thegovernment] shows that the restriction serves a compellinginterest and that there are no less restrictive alternatives\").\n\nThe application of strict scrutiny to a public library's useof filtering products thus requires three distinct inquiries.First, we must identify those compelling government intereststhat the use of filtering software promotes. It is thennecessary to analyze whether the use of software filters isnarrowly tailored to further those interests. Finally, we mustdetermine whether less restrictive alternatives exist that wouldpromote the state interest.\n\nA. State Interests\n\nWe begin by identifying those legitimate state interests thata public library's use of software filters promotes.\n\n1. Preventing the Dissemination of Obscenity, Child Pornography, and Material Harmful to Minors\n\nOn its face, CIPA is clearly intended to prevent publiclibraries' Internet terminals from being used to disseminate tolibrary patrons visual depictions that are obscene, childpornography, or in the case of minors, harmful to minors. SeeCIPA § 1712 (codified at 20 U.S.C. § 9134(f)(1)(A) \u0026 (B)), §1721(b) (codified at 47 U.S.C. § 254(h)(6)(B) \u0026 (C)) (requiringany library that receives E-rate discounts to certify that it isenforcing \"a policy of Internet safety that includes theoperation of a technology protection measure with respect to anyof its computers with Internet access that protects againstaccess through such computers to visual depictions\" that are\"obscene\" or \"child pornography,\" and, when the computers are inuse by minors, also protects against access to visual depictionsthat are \"harmful to minors\").\n\nThe government's interest in preventing the dissemination ofobscenity, child pornography, or, in the case of minors,material harmful to minors, is well-established. Speech that isobscene, under the legal definition of obscenity set forth inthe margin, is unprotected under the First Amendment, andaccordingly the state has a compelling interest in preventingits distribution.\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e29\u003c/span\u003e See Miller v. California,413 U.S. 15, 18, 93 S.Ct. 2607, 37 L.Ed.2d 419 (1973) (\"This Court hasrecognized that the States have a legitimate interest inprohibiting dissemination or exhibition of obscene material.\");Stanley v. Georgia, 394 U.S. 557, 563, 89 S.Ct. 1243, 22L.Ed.2d 542 (1969) (\"[T]he First and Fourteenth Amendmentsrecognize a valid governmental interest in dealing with theproblem of obscenity.\"); Roth v. United States, 354 U.S. 476,485, 77 S.Ct. 1304, 1 L.Ed.2d 1498 (1957) (\"We hold thatobscenity is not within the area of constitutionally protectedspeech of press.\").\n\nThe First Amendment also permits the state to prohibit thedistribution to minors of material that, while notobscene with respect to adults, is obscene with respect tominors. See Ginsberg v. New York, 390 U.S. 629, 637, 88 S.Ct.1274, 20 L.Ed.2d 195 (1968) (holding that it is constitutionallypermissible \"to accord minors under 17 a more restricted rightthan that assured to adults to judge and determine forthemselves what sex material they may read or see\"). Proscribingthe distribution of such material to minors is constitutionallyjustified by the government's well-recognized interest insafeguarding minors' well-being. See Reno v. ACLU,521 U.S. 844, 869-70, 117 S.Ct. 2329, 138 L.Ed.2d 874 (1997) (\"[T]here isa compelling interest in protecting the physical andpsychological well-being of minors which extend[s] to shieldingthem from indecent messages that are not obscene by adultstandards. . . .\") (internal quotation marks and citationomitted); New York v. Ferber, 458 U.S. 747, 756-57, 102 S.Ct.3348, 73 L.Ed.2d 1113 (1982) (\"It is evident beyond the need forelaboration that a State's interest in safeguarding the physicaland psychological well-being of a minor is compelling.\")(internal quotation marks and citation omitted); Ginsberg, 390U.S. at 640, 88 S.Ct. 1274 (\"The State . . . has an independentinterest in the well-being of its youth.\").\n\nThe government's compelling interest in protecting thewell-being of its youth justifies laws that criminalize not onlythe distribution to minors of material that is harmful tominors, but also the possession and distribution of childpornography. See Osborne v. Ohio, 495 U.S. 103, 111, 110 S.Ct.1691, 109 L.Ed.2d 98 (1990) (holding that a state \"mayconstitutionally proscribe the possession and viewing of childpornography\"); Ferber, 458 U.S. at 757, 763, 102 S.Ct. 3348(noting that \"[t]he prevention of sexual exploitation and abuseof children constitutes a government objective of surpassingimportance,\" and holding that \"child pornography [is] a categoryof material outside the protection of the First Amendment\").\n\nThus, a public library's use of software filters survivesstrict scrutiny if it is narrowly tailored to further thestate's well-recognized interest in preventing the disseminationof obscenity and child pornography, and in preventing minorsfrom being exposed to material harmful to their well-being.\n\n2. Protecting the Unwilling Viewer\n\nSeveral of the libraries that use filters assert that filtersserve the libraries' interest in preventing patrons from beingunwillingly exposed to sexually explicit speech that the patronsfind offensive. Nearly every library proffered by either thegovernment or the plaintiffs received complaints, in varyingdegrees of frequency, from library patrons who saw other patronsaccessing sexually explicit material on the library's Internetterminals.\n\nIn general, First Amendment jurisprudence is reluctant torecognize a legitimate state interest in protecting theunwilling viewer from speech that is constitutionally protected.\"Where the designed benefit of a content-based speechrestriction is to shield the sensibilities of listeners, thegeneral rule is that the right of expression prevails, evenwhere no less restrictive alternative exists. We are expected toprotect our own sensibilities simply by averting our eyes.\"Playboy, 529 U.S. at 813, 120 S.Ct. 1878 (2000) (internalquotation marks and citation omitted); see also Erznoznik v.City of Jacksonville, 422 U.S. 205, 209, 95 S.Ct. 2268, 45L.Ed.2d 125 (1975) (\"[W]hen the government, acting as censor,undertakes selectively to shield the public from some kinds ofspeech on the ground that they are more offensive than others,the First Amendment strictly limits its power.\").\n\nFor example, in Cohen v. California, 403 U.S. 15, 91 S.Ct.1780, 29 L.Ed.2d 284 (1971), the Supreme Court reverseddefendant's conviction for wearing, in a municipal courthouse, ajacket bearing the inscription \"Fuck the Draft.\" The Court notedthat \"much has been made of the claim that Cohen's distastefulmode of expression was thrust upon unwilling or unsuspectingviewers, and that the State might therefore legitimately act asit did in order to protect the sensitive from otherwiseunavoidable exposure to appellant's crude form of protest.\"Id. at 21, 91 S.Ct. 1780. This justification for suppressingspeech failed, however, because it \"would effectively empower amajority to silence dissidents simply as a matter of personalpredilections.\" Id. The Court concluded that \"[t]hose in theLos Angeles courthouse could effectively avoid furtherbombardment of their sensibilities simply by averting theireyes.\" Id.\n\nSimilarly, in Erznoznik, the Court invalidated on its face amunicipal ordinance prohibiting drive-in movie theaters fromshowing films containing nudity if they were visible from apublic street or place. The city's \"primary argument [was] thatit may protect its citizens against unwilling exposure tomaterials that may be offensive.\" 422 U.S. at 208, 95 S.Ct.2268. The Court soundly rejected this interest in shielding theunwilling viewer:\n\nThe plain, if at times disquieting, truth is that in our pluralistic society, constantly proliferating new and ingenious forms of expression, we are inescapably captive audiences for many purposes. Much that we encounter offends our esthetic, if not our political and moral, sensibilities. Nevertheless, the Constitution does not permit government to decide which types of otherwise protected speech are sufficiently offensive to require protection for the unwilling listener or viewer. Rather, absent . . . narrow circumstances . . . the burden normally falls upon the viewer to avoid further bombardment of his sensibilities simply by averting his eyes.\n\n422 U.S. at 210-11, 95 S.Ct. 2268 (internal quotation marks andcitation omitted).\n\nThe state's interest in protecting unwilling viewers fromexposure to patently offensive material is accounted for, tosome degree, by obscenity doctrine, which originated in part topermit the state to shield the unwilling viewer. \"The Millerstandard, like its predecessors, was an accommodation betweenthe State's interests in protecting the sensibilities ofunwilling recipients from exposure to pornographic material andthe dangers of censorship inherent in unabashedly content-basedlaws.\" Ferber, 458 U.S. at 756, 102 S.Ct. 3348 (internalquotation marks and citation omitted); see also Miller, 413U.S. at 18-19, 93 S.Ct. 2607 (\"This Court has recognized thatthe States have a legitimate interest in prohibitingdissemination or exhibition of obscene material when the mode ofdissemination carries with it a significant danger of offendingthe sensibilities of unwilling recipients or of exposure tojuveniles.\") (citation omitted). To the extent that speech hasserious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value, andtherefore is not obscene under the Miller test of obscenity,the state's interest in shielding unwilling viewers from suchspeech is tenuous.\n\nNonetheless, the Court has recognized that in certain limitedcircumstances, the state has a legitimate interest in protectingthe public from unwilling exposure to speech that is notobscene. This interest has justified restrictions on speech\"when the speaker intrudes on the privacy of the home, or thedegree of captivity makes it impractical for the unwillingviewer or auditor to avoid exposure.\" Erznoznik,422 U.S. at 209, 95 S.Ct. 2268 (citations omitted). Thus, inFCC v. Pacifica Foundation, 438 U.S. 726, 98 S.Ct. 3026, 57L.Ed.2d 1073 (1978), the Court relied on the state's interest inshielding viewers' sensibilities to uphold a prohibition againstprofanity in radio broadcasts:\n\nPatently offensive, indecent material presented over the airwaves confronts the citizen, not only in public, but also in the privacy of the home, where the individual's right to be left alone plainly outweighs the First Amendment rights of an intruder. Because the broadcast audience is constantly tuning in and out, prior warnings cannot completely protect the listener or viewer from unexpected program content.\n\nId. at 748, 98 S.Ct. 3026 (citation omitted); accord Frisbyv. Schultz, 487 U.S. 474, 485, 108 S.Ct. 2495, 101 L.Ed.2d 420(1988) (\"Although in many locations, we expect individualssimply to avoid speech they do not want to hear, the home isdifferent.\"); see also Lehman v. City of Shaker Heights,418 U.S. 298, 302, 94 S.Ct. 2714, 41 L.Ed.2d 770 (1974) (pluralityopinion) (upholding a content-based restriction on the sale ofadvertising space in public transit vehicles and noting that\"[t]he streetcar audience is a captive audience\").\n\nAlthough neither the Supreme Court nor the Third Circuit hasrecognized a compelling state interest in shielding thesensibilities of unwilling viewers, beyond laws intended topreserve the privacy of individuals' homes or to protect captiveaudiences, we do not read the case law as categoricallyforeclosing recognition, in the public library setting, of thestate's interest in protecting unwilling viewers. SeePacifica, 438 U.S. at 749 n. 27, 98 S.Ct. 3026 (\"Outside thehome, the balance between the offensive speaker and theunwilling audience may sometimes tip in favor of the speaker,requiring the offended listener to turn away.\") (emphasisadded). Under certain circumstances, therefore a public librarymight have a compelling interest in protecting library patronsand staff from unwilling exposure to sexually explicit speechthat, although not obscene, is patently offensive.\n\n3. Preventing Unlawful or Inappropriate Conduct\n\nSeveral of the librarians proffered by the governmenttestified that unfiltered Internet access had led to occurrencesof criminal or otherwise inappropriate conduct by librarypatrons, such as public masturbation, and harassment of librarystaff and patrons, sometimes rising to the level of physicalassault. As in the case with patron complaints, however, thegovernment adduced no quantitative data comparing the frequencyof criminal or otherwise inappropriate patron conduct before thelibrary's use of filters and after the library's use of filters.The sporadic anecdotal accounts of the government's librarywitnesses were countered by anecdotal accounts by theplaintiffs' library witnesses, that incidents of offensivepatron behavior in public libraries have long predated theadvent of Internet access.\n\nAside from a public library's interest in preventing patronsfrom using the library's Internet terminals to receive obscenityor child pornography, which constitutes criminal conduct, we areconstrained to reject any compelling state interest inregulating patrons' conduct as a justification for content-basedrestrictions on patrons' Internet access. \"[T]he Court's FirstAmendment cases draw vital distinctions between words and deeds,between ideas and conduct.\" Ashcroft, ___ U.S. at ___, 122S.Ct. at 1403. First Amendment jurisprudence makes clear thatspeech may not be restricted on the ground that restrictingspeech will reduce crime orother undesirable behavior that the speech is thought to cause,subject to only a narrow exception for speech that \"is directedto inciting or producing imminent lawless action and is likelyto incite or produce such action.\" Brandenburg v. Ohio,395 U.S. 444, 447, 89 S.Ct. 1827, 23 L.Ed.2d 430 (1969) (percuriam). \"The mere tendency of speech to encourage unlawful actsis insufficient reason for banning it.\" Ashcroft, ___ U.S. at___, 122 S.Ct. at 1403.\n\nOutside of the narrow \"incitement\" exception, the appropriatemethod of deterring unlawful or otherwise undesirable behavioris not to suppress the speech that induces such behavior, but toattach sanctions to the behavior itself. \"Among free men, thedeterrents ordinarily to be applied to prevent crime areeducation and punishment for violations of the law, notabridgement of the rights of free speech.\" Kingsley Int'lPictures Corp. v. Regents of the Univ. of the State of NewYork, 360 U.S. 684, 689, 79 S.Ct. 1362, 3 L.Ed.2d 1512 (1959)(quoting Whitney v. Cal., 274 U.S. 357, 378, 47 S.Ct. 641, 71L.Ed. 1095 (1927) (Brandeis, J., concurring)); see alsoBartnicki v. Vopper, 532 U.S. 514, 529, 121 S.Ct. 1753, 149L.Ed.2d 787 (2001) (\"The normal method of deterring unlawfulconduct is to impose an appropriate punishment on the person whoengages in it.\").\n\n4. Summary\n\nIn sum, we reject a public library's interest in preventingunlawful or otherwise inappropriate patron conduct as a basisfor restricting patrons' access to speech on the Internet. Theproper method for a library to deter unlawful or inappropriatepatron conduct, such as harassment or assault of other patrons,is to impose sanctions on such conduct, such as either removingthe patron from the library, revoking the patron's libraryprivileges, or, in the appropriate case, calling the police. Webelieve, however, that the state interests in preventing thedissemination of obscenity, child pornography, or in the case ofminors, material harmful to minors, and in protecting librarypatrons from being unwillingly exposed to offensive, sexuallyexplicit material, could all justify, for First Amendmentpurposes, a public library's use of Internet filters, providedthat use of such filters is narrowly tailored to further thoseinterests, and that no less restrictive means of promoting thoseinterests exist. Accordingly, we turn to the narrow tailoringquestion.\n\nB. Narrow Tailoring\n\nHaving identified the relevant state interests that couldjustify content-based restrictions on public libraries'provision of Internet access, we must determine whether a publiclibrary's use of software filters is narrowly tailored tofurther those interests. \"It is not enough to show that theGovernment's ends are compelling; the means must be carefullytailored to achieve those ends.\" Sable Communications of Cal.,Inc. v. FCC, 492 U.S. 115, 126, 109 S.Ct. 2829, 106 L.Ed.2d 93(1989). \"[M]anifest imprecision of [a] ban . . . reveals thatits proscription is not sufficiently tailored to the harms itseeks to prevent to justify . . . substantial interference with. . . speech.\" FCC v. League of Women Voters of Cal.,468 U.S. 364, 392, 104 S.Ct. 3106, 82 L.Ed.2d 278 (1984).\n\nThe commercially available filters on which evidence waspresented at trial all block many thousands of Web pages thatare clearly not harmful to minors, and many thousands more pagesthat, while possibly harmful to minors, are neither obscene norchild pornography. See supra, Subsection II.E.7. Even thedefendants' own expert, after analyzing filtering products'performance in public libraries, concluded that of the blockedWeb pages to which library patrons sought access, between 6% and15% contained no contentthat meets even the filtering products' own definitions ofsexually explicit content, let alone the legal definitions ofobscenity or child pornography, which none of the filteringcompanies that were studied use as the basis for their blockingdecisions. Moreover, in light of the flaws in these studies,discussed in detail in our findings of fact above, thesepercentages significantly underestimate the amount of speechthat filters erroneously block, and at best provide a roughlower bound on the filters' rates of overblocking. Given thesubstantial amount of constitutionally protected speech blockedby the filters studied, we conclude that use of such filters isnot narrowly tailored with respect to the government's interestin preventing the dissemination of obscenity, child pornography,and material harmful to minors.\n\nTo be sure, the quantitative estimates of the rates ofoverblocking apply only to those four commercially availablefilters analyzed by plaintiffs' and defendants' expertwitnesses. Nonetheless, given the inherent limitations in thecurrent state of the art of automated classification systems,and the limits of human review in relation to the size, rate ofgrowth, and rate of change of the Web, there is a tradeoffbetween underblocking and overblocking that is inherent in anyfiltering technology, as our findings of fact have demonstrated.We credit the testimony of plaintiffs' expert witness, Dr.Geoffrey Nunberg, that no software exists that can automaticallydistinguish visual depictions that are obscene, childpornography, or harmful to minors, from those that are not. Norcan software, through keyword analysis or more sophisticatedtechniques, consistently distinguish web pages that contain suchcontent from web pages that do not.\n\nIn light of the absence of any automated method of classifyingWeb pages, filtering companies are left with the Sisyphean taskof using human review to identify, from among the approximatelytwo billion web pages that exist, the 1.5 million new pages thatare created daily, and the many thousands of pages whose contentchanges from day to day, those particular web pages to beblocked; To cope with the Web's extraordinary size, rate ofgrowth, and rate of change, filtering companies that rely solelyon human review to block access, to material falling withintheir category definitions must use a variety of techniques thatwill necessarily introduce substantial amounts of overblocking.These techniques include blocking every page of a Web site thatcontains only some content falling within the filteringcompanies' category definitions, blocking every Web site thatshares an IP-address with a Web site whose content falls withinthe category definitions, blocking \"loophole sites,\" such asanonymizers, cache sites, and translation sites, and allocatingstaff resources to reviewing content of uncategorized pagesrather than re-reviewing pages, domain names, or IP-addressesthat have been already categorized to determine whether theircontent has changed. While a filtering company could choose notto use these techniques, due to the overblocking errors theyintroduce, if a filtering company does not use such techniques,its filter will be ineffective at blocking access to speech thatfalls within its category definitions.\n\nThus, while it would be easy to design, for example, a filterthat blocks only ten Web sites, all of which are either obscene,child pornography, or harmful to minors, and thereforecompletely avoids overblocking, such a filter clearly would notcomply with CIPA, since it would fail to offer any meaningfulprotection against the hundreds of thousands of Web sitescontaining speech in these categories. As detailed in ourfindings of fact, any filter that blocks enough speech toprotect against access to visual depictions that are obscene,childpornography, and harmful to minors, will necessarily overblocksubstantial amounts of speech that does not fall within thesecategories.\n\nThis finding is supported by the government's failure toproduce evidence of any filtering technology that avoidsoverblocking a substantial amount of protected speech. Where, ashere, strict scrutiny applies to a content-based restriction onspeech, the burden rests with the government to show that therestriction is narrowly tailored to serve a compellinggovernment interest. See Playboy, 529 U.S. at 816, 120 S.Ct.1878 (\"When the Government restricts speech, the Governmentbears the burden of proving the constitutionality of itsactions.\"); see also R.A.V. v. City of St. Paul, 505 U.S. 377,382, 112 S.Ct. 2538, 120 L.Ed.2d 305 (1992) (\"Content-basedregulations are presumptively invalid.\"). Thus, it is thegovernment's burden, in this case, to show the existence of afiltering technology that both blocks enough speech to qualifyas a technology protection measure, for purposes of CIPA, andavoids overblocking a substantial amount of constitutionallyprotected speech.\n\nHere, the government has failed to meet its burden. Indeed, asdiscussed in our findings of fact, every technology protectionmeasure used by the government's library witnesses or analyzedby the government's expert witnesses blocks access to asubstantial amount of speech that is constitutionally protectedwith respect to both adults and minors. In light of the creditedtestimony of Dr. Nunberg, and the inherent tradeoff betweenoverblocking and underblocking, together with the government'sfailure to offer evidence of any technology protection measurethat avoids overblocking, we conclude that any technologyprotection measure that blocks a sufficient amount of speech tocomply with CIPA's requirement that it \"protect[] against accessthrough such computers to visual depictions that are — (I)obscene; (II) child pornography; or (III) harmful to minors\"will necessarily block substantial amounts of speech that doesnot fall within these categories. CIPA § 1712 (codified at20 U.S.C. § 9134(f)(1)(A)). Hence, any public library's use of asoftware filter required by CIPA will fail to be narrowlytailored to the government's compelling interest in preventingthe dissemination, through Internet terminals in publiclibraries, of visual depictions that are obscene, childpornography, or harmful to minors.\n\nWhere, as here, strict scrutiny applies, the government maynot justify restrictions on constitutionally protected speechon the ground that such restrictions are necessary in order forthe government effectively to suppress the dissemination ofconstitutionally unprotected speech, such as obscenity andchild pornography. \"The argument . . . that protected speech maybe banned as a means to ban unprotected speech. . . . turns theFirst Amendment upside down. The Government may not suppresslawful speech as the means to suppress unlawful speech.\"Ashcroft, ___ U.S. at ___, 122 S.Ct. at 1404. This rulereflects the judgment that \"[t]he possible harm to society inpermitting some unprotected speech to go unpunished isoutweighed by the possibility that protected speech of othersmay be muted. . . .\" Broadrick v. Oklahoma, 413 U.S. at 612,93 S.Ct. 2908.\n\nThus, in Ashcroft, the Supreme Court rejected thegovernment's argument that a statute criminalizing thedistribution of constitutionally protected \"virtual\" childpornography, produced through computer imaging technologywithout the use of real children, was necessary to further thestate's interest in prosecuting thedissemination of constitutionally unprotected child pornographyproduced using real children, since \"the possibility ofproducing images by using computer imaging makes it verydifficult for [the government] to prosecute those who producepornography using real children.\" Ashcroft, ___ U.S. at ___,122 S.Ct. at 1404; see also Stanley, 394 U.S. at 567-58, 89S.Ct. 1243 (holding that individuals have a First Amendmentright to possess obscene material, even though the existence ofthis right makes it more difficult for the states to furthertheir legitimate interest in prosecuting the distribution ofobscenity). By the same token, even if the use of filters iseffective in preventing patrons from receiving constitutionallyunprotected speech, the government's interest in preventing thedissemination of such speech cannot justify the use of thetechnology protection measures mandated by CIPA, whichnecessarily block substantial amounts of constitutionallyprotected speech.\n\nCIPA thus resembles the Communications Decency Act, which theSupreme Court facially invalidated in Reno v. ACLU,521 U.S. 844, 117 S.Ct. 2329, 138 L.Ed.2d 874 (1997). Although on itsface, the CDA simply restricted the distribution to minors ofspeech that was constitutionally unprotected with respect tominors, as a practical matter, given Web sites' difficulties inidentifying the ages of Internet users, the CDA effectivelyprohibited the distribution to adults of material that wasconstitutionally protected with respect to adults.\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e30\u003c/span\u003eSimilarly, although on its face, CIPA, like the CDA, requiresthe suppression of only constitutionally unprotected speech, itis impossible as a practical matter, given the state of the artof filtering technology, for a public library to comply withCIPA without also blocking significant amounts ofconstitutionally protected speech. We therefore hold that alibrary's use of a technology protection measure required byCIPA is not narrowly tailored to the government's legitimateinterest in preventing the dissemination of visual depictionsthat are obscene, child pornography, or in the case of minors,harmful to minors.\n\nFor the same reason that a public library's use of softwarefilters is not narrowly tailored to further the library'sinterest in preventing its computers from being used todisseminate visual depictions that are obscene, childpornography, and harmful to minors, a public library's use ofsoftware filters is not narrowly tailored to further thelibrary's interest in protecting patrons from being unwillinglyexposed to offensive, sexually explicit material. As discussedin our findings of fact, the filters required by CIPA blocksubstantial numbers of Web sites that even the most puritanicalpublic library patron would not find offensive, such ashttp://federo.com, a Web site that promotes federalism inUganda, which N2H2 blocked as \"Adults Only, Pornography,\" andhttp://www.vvm.com/bond/home.htm, a site for aspiringdentists, which was blocked by Cyberpatrol as \"Adult/SexuallyExplicit.\" We list manymore such examples in our findings of fact, see supra, andfind that such erroneously blocked sites number in at least thethousands.\n\nAlthough we have found large amounts of overblocking, even ifonly a small percentage of sites blocked are erroneouslyblocked, either with respect to the state's interest inpreventing adults from viewing material that is obscene or childpornography and in preventing minors from viewing material thatis harmful to minors, or with respect to the state's interest inpreventing library patrons generally from being unwillinglyexposed to offensive, sexually explicit material, thisimprecision is fatal under the First Amendment. Cf. Reno, 521U.S. at 874, 117 S.Ct. 2329 (\"[T]he CDA lacks the precision thatthe First Amendment requires when a statute regulates thecontent of speech.\"); League of Women Voters, 468 U.S. at 398,104 S.Ct. 3106 (\"[E]ven if some of the hazards at which [thechallenged provision] was aimed are sufficiently substantial,the restriction is not crafted with sufficient precision toremedy those dangers that may exist to justify the significantabridgement of speech worked by the provision's broadban. . . .\").\n\nWhile the First Amendment does not demand perfection when thegovernment restricts speech in order to advance a compellinginterest, the substantial amounts of erroneous blocking inherentin the technology protection measures mandated by CIPA are morethan simply de minimis instances of human error. \"The linebetween speech unconditionally guaranteed and speech which maylegitimately be regulated, suppressed, or punished is finelydrawn. Error in marking that line exacts an extraordinary cost.\"Playboy, 529 U.S. at 817, 120 S.Ct. 1878 (internal quotationmarks and citation omitted). Indeed, \"precision of regulationmust be the touchstone in an area so closely touching our mostprecious freedoms.\" Keyishian v. Bd. of Regents of the Univ. ofthe State of N.Y., 385 U.S. 589, 603, 87 S.Ct. 675, 17 L.Ed.2d629 (1967) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted); seealso Bantam Books, Inc. v. Sullivan, 372 U.S. 58, 66, 83 S.Ct.631, 9 L.Ed.2d 584 (1963) (\"The separation of legitimate fromillegitimate speech calls for sensitive tools.\") (internalquotation marks and citation omitted). Where the governmentdraws content-based restrictions on speech in order to advance acompelling government interest, the First Amendment demands theprecision of a scalpel, not a sledgehammer. We believe that apublic library's use of the technology protection measuresmandated by CIPA is not narrowly tailored to further thegovernmental interests at stake.\n\nAlthough the strength of different libraries' interests inblocking certain forms of speech may vary from library tolibrary, depending on the frequency and severity of problemsexperienced by each particular library, we conclude, based onour findings of fact, that any public library's use of afiltering product mandated by CIPA will necessarily fail to benarrowly tailored to address the library's legitimate interests.Because it is impossible for a public library to comply withCIPA without blocking substantial amounts of speech whosesuppression serves no legitimate state interest, we thereforehold that CIPA is facially invalid, even under the morestringent standard of facial invalidity urged on us by thegovernment, which would require upholding CIPA if it is possiblefor just a single library to comply with CIPA's conditionswithout violating the First Amendment. See supra Part III.\n\nC. Less Restrictive Alternatives\n\nThe constitutional infirmity of a public library's use ofsoftware filters is evidenced not only by the absence of narrowtailoring, but also by the existence of less restrictivealternatives that further the government's legitimate interests.See Playboy, 529 U.S. at 813, 120 S.Ct. 1878 (\"If a lessrestrictive alternative would serve the Government's purpose,the legislature must use that alternative.\"); Sable, 492 U.S.at 126, 109 S.Ct. 2829 (\"The Government may . . . regulate thecontent of constitutionally protected speech in order to promotea compelling interest if it chooses the least restrictive meansto further the articulated interest.\").\n\nAs is the case with the narrow tailoring requirement, thegovernment bears the burden of proof in showing theineffectiveness of less restrictive alternatives. \"When aplausible, less restrictive alternative is offered to acontent-based speech restriction, it is the Government'sobligation to prove that the alternative will be ineffective toachieve its goals.\" Playboy, 529 U.S. at 816, 120 S.Ct. 1878;see also Reno, 521 U.S. at 879, 117 S.Ct. 2329 (\"The breadthof this content-based restriction of speech imposes anespecially heavy burden on the Government to explain why a lessrestrictive provision would not be as effective. . . .\");Fabulous Assocs., Inc. v. Pa. Pub. Util. Comm'n, 896 F.2d 780,787 (3d Cir. 1990) (\"We focus . . . on the more difficultquestion whether the Commonwealth has borne its heavy burden ofdemonstrating that the compelling state interest could not beserved by restrictions that are less intrusive on protectedforms of expression.\") (internal quotation marks and citationomitted).\n\nWe find that there are plausible, less restrictivealternatives to the use of software filters that would serve thegovernment's interest in preventing the dissemination ofobscenity and child pornography to library patrons. Inparticular, public libraries can adopt Internet use policiesthat make clear to patrons that the library's Internet terminalsmay not be used to access illegal content. Libraries can ensurethat their patrons are aware of such policies by posting them inprominent places in the library, requiring patrons to sign formsagreeing to comply with the policy before the library issueslibrary cards to patrons, and by presenting patrons, when theylog on to one of the library's Internet terminals, with a screenthat requires the user to agree to comply with the library'spolicy before allowing the user access to the Internet.\n\nLibraries can detect violations of their Internet use policieseither through direct observation or through review of thelibrary's Internet use logs. In some cases, library staff orpatrons may directly observe a patron accessing obscenity andchild pornography. Libraries' Internet use logs, however, alsoprovide libraries with a means of detecting violations of theirInternet use policies. These logs, which can be kept regardlesswhether a library uses filtering software, record the URL ofevery Web page accessed by patrons. Although ordinarily the logsdo not link particular URLs with particular patrons, it ispossible, using access logs, to identify the patron who viewedthe Web page corresponding to a particular URL, if library staffdiscover in the access logs the URL of a Web page containingobscenity or child pornography. For example, David Biek,Director of Tacoma Public Library's main branch, testified thatin the course of scanning Internet use logs he has found whatlooked like attempts to access child pornography,notwithstanding the fact that Tacoma uses Websense filteringsoftware. In two cases, he communicated his findings to lawenforcement and turned over thelogs to law enforcement in response to a subpoena.\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e31\u003c/span\u003e\n\nOnce a violation of a library's Internet use policy isdetected through the methods described above, a library mayeither issue the patron a warning, revoke the patron's Internetprivileges, or notify law enforcement, if the library believesthat the patron violated either state obscenity laws or childpornography laws. Although these methods of detecting use oflibrary computers to access illegal content are not perfect, anda library, out of respect for patrons' privacy, may choose notto adopt such policies, the government has failed to show thatsuch methods are substantially less effective at preventingpatrons from accessing obscenity and child pornography thansoftware filters. As detailed in our findings of fact, theunderblocking that results from the size, rate of change, andrate of growth of the Internet significantly impairs thesoftware filters from preventing patrons from accessingobscenity and child pornography. Unless software filters arethemselves perfectly effective at preventing patrons fromaccessing obscenity and child pornography, \"[i]t is no responsethat [a less restrictive alternative] . . . may not go perfectlyevery time.\" Playboy, 529 U.S. at 824, 120 S.Ct. 1878; cf.Denver Area Educ. Telecomm. Consortium, Inc. v. FCC,518 U.S. 727, 759, 116 S.Ct. 2374, 135 L.Ed.2d 888 (1996) (\"No provision. . . short of an absolute ban, can offer certain protectionagainst assault by a determined child.\").\n\nThe government has not offered any data comparing thefrequency with which obscenity and child pornography is accessedat libraries that enforce their Internet use policies throughsoftware filters with the frequency with which obscenity andchild pornography is accessed at public libraries that enforcetheir Internet use policies through methods other than softwarefilters. Although the government's library witnesses offeredanecdotal accounts of a reduction in the use of librarycomputers to access sexually explicit speech when filteringsoftware was mandated, these anecdotal accounts are not asubstitute for more robust analyses comparing the use of librarycomputers to access child pornography and material that meetsthe legal definition of obscenity in libraries that use blockingsoftware and in libraries that use alternative methods. Cf.Playboy, 529 U.S. at 822, 120 S.Ct. 1878 (\"[T]he Governmentmust present more than anecdote and supposition.\").\n\nWe acknowledge that some library staff will be uncomfortableusing the \"tap-on-the-shoulder\" method of enforcing thelibrary's policy against using Internet terminals to accessobscenity and child pornography. The Greenville County Library,for example, experienced high turnover among library staff whenstaff were required to enforce the library'sInternet use policy through the tap-on-the-shoulder technique.Given filters' inevitable underblocking, however, even a librarythat uses filtering will have to resort to a tap-on-the-shouldermethod of enforcement, where library staff observes a patronopenly violating the library's Internet use policy, by, forexample, accessing material that is obviously child pornographybut that the filtering software failed to block. Moreover, alibrary employee's degree of comfort in using thetap-on-the-shoulder method will vary from employee to employee,and there is no evidence that it is impossible or prohibitivelycostly for public libraries to hire at least some employees whoare comfortable enforcing the library's Internet use policy.\n\nWe also acknowledge that use of a tap on the shoulderdelegates to librarians substantial discretion to determinewhich Web sites a patron may view. Nonetheless, we do notbelieve that this putative \"prior restraint\" problem can beavoided through the use of software filters, for theyeffectively delegate to the filtering company the sameunfettered discretion to determine which Web sites a patron mayview. Moreover, as noted above, violations of a public library'sInternet use policy may be detected not only by directobservation, but also by reviewing the library's Internet uselogs after the fact, which alleviates the need for library staffto directly confront patrons while they are viewing obscenity orchild pornography.\n\nSimilar less restrictive alternatives exist for preventingminors from accessing material harmful to minors. First,libraries may use the tap-on-the-shoulder method when minors areobserved using the Internet to access material that is harmfulto minors. Requiring minors to use specific terminals, forexample in a children's room, that are in direct view of librarystaff will increase the likelihood that library staff willdetect minors' use of the Internet to access material harmful tominors. Alternatively, public libraries could require minors touse blocking software only if they are unaccompanied by aparent, or only if their parent consents in advance to theirchild's unfiltered use of the Internet.\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e32\u003c/span\u003e \"A court shouldnot assume that a plausible, less restrictive alternative wouldbe ineffective; and a court should not presume parents, givenfull information, will fail to act.\" Playboy, 529 U.S. at 824,120 S.Ct. 1878.\n\nIn contrast to the \"harmful to minors\" statute upheld inGinsberg v. New York, 390 U.S. 629, 88 S.Ct. 1274, 20 L.Ed.2d195 (1968), which permitted parents' to determine whether toprovide their children with access to material otherwiseprohibited by the statute, CIPA, like the Communications DecencyAct, which the Court invalidated in Reno, contains noexception for parental consent:\n\n[W]e noted in Ginsberg that \"the prohibition against sales to minors does not bar parents who so desire from purchasing the magazines for their children.\" Under the CDA, by contrast, neither the parents' consent — nor even their participation — in the communication would avoid the application of the statute.\n\nReno, 521 U.S. at 865, 117 S.Ct. 2329 (citation omitted); seealso Ginsberg, 390 U.S. at 639, 88 S.Ct. 1274 (\"It is cardinalwith us that the custody, care, and nurtureof the child reside first in the parents, whose primary functionand freedom include preparation for obligations the state canneither supply nor hinder.\" (quoting Prince v. Massachusetts,321 U.S. 158, 166, 64 S.Ct. 438, 88 L.Ed. 645 (1944))).\n\nThe Court in Playboy acknowledged that although a regime ofpermitting parents voluntarily to block cable channelscontaining sexually explicit programming might not be acompletely effective alternative to the challenged law, whicheffectively required cable operators to transmit sexuallyexplicit programming only during particular hours, thechallenged law itself was not completely effective in servingthe government's interest:\n\nThere can be little doubt, of course, that under a voluntary blocking regime, even with adequate notice, some children will be exposed to signal bleed; and we need not discount the possibility that a graphic image could have a negative impact on a young child. It must be remembered, however, that children will be exposed to signal bleed under time channeling as well. . . . The record is silent as to the comparative effectiveness of the two alternatives.\n\nPlayboy, 529 U.S. at 826, 120 S.Ct. 1878. Similarly, in thiscase, the government has offered no evidence comparing theeffectiveness of blocking software and alternative methods usedby public libraries to protect children from material harmful tominors.\n\nFinally, there are other less restrictive alternatives tofiltering software that further public libraries' interest inpreventing patrons from unwillingly being exposed to patentlyoffensive, sexually explicit content on the Internet. To theextent that public libraries are concerned with protectingpatrons from accidentally encountering such material while usingthe Internet, public libraries can provide patrons with guidancein finding the material they want and avoiding unwantedmaterial. Some public libraries also offer patrons the option ofusing filtering software, if they so desire. Cf. Rowan v. PostOffice Dept., 397 U.S. 728, 90 S.Ct. 1484, 25 L.Ed.2d 736(1970) (upholding a federal statute permitting individuals toinstruct the Postmaster General not to deliver advertisementsthat are \"erotically arousing or sexually provocative\").\n\nWith respect to protecting library patrons from sexuallyexplicit content viewed by other patrons, public libraries haveused a variety of less restrictive methods. One alternative issimply to segregate filtered from unfiltered terminals, and toplace unfiltered terminals outside of patrons' sight-lines andareas of heavy traffic. Even the less restrictive alternative ofallowing unfiltered access on only a single terminal, well outof the line of sight of other patrons, however, is not permittedunder CIPA, which requires the use of a technology protectionmeasure on every computer in the library. See CIPA §1721(b)(6)(C) (codified at 47 U.S.C. § 254(h)(6)(C)), CIPA §1712 (codified at 20 U.S.C. § 9134(f)(1)(A)) (requiring a publiclibrary receiving E-rate discounts or LSTA grants to certifythat it \"has in place a policy of Internet safety that includesthe operation of a technology protection measure with respect toany of its computers with Internet access. . . .\" (emphasisadded)); In re Federal State Joint Board on Universal Service:Children's Internet Protection Act, CC Docket No. 96-45, Reportand Order, FCC 01-120, ¶ 30 (Apr. 5, 2001) (\"CIPA makes nodistinction between computers used only by staff and thoseaccessible to the public.\").\n\nAlternatively, libraries can use privacy screens or recessedmonitors to prevent patrons from unwillingly being exposed tomaterial viewed by other patrons. Weacknowledge that privacy screens and recessed monitors sufferfrom imperfections as alternatives to filtering. Both imposecosts on the library, particularly recessed monitors, which,according to the government's library witnesses, are expensive.Moreover, some libraries have experienced problems with patronsattempting to remove the privacy screens. Privacy screens andrecessed monitors also make it difficult for more than oneperson to work at the same terminal.\n\nThese problems, however, are not insurmountable. While thereis no doubt that privacy screens and recessed terminals imposeadditional costs on libraries, the government has failed to showthat the cost of privacy screens or recessed terminals issubstantially greater than the cost of filtering software andthe resources needed to maintain such software. Nor has thegovernment shown that the cost of these alternatives is so highas to make their use prohibitive. With respect to the problem ofpatrons removing privacy screens, we find, based on thesuccessful use of privacy screens by the Fort Vancouver RegionalLibrary and the Multnomah County Public Library, that it ispossible for public libraries to prevent patrons from removingthe screens. Although privacy screens may make it difficult forpatrons to work at the same terminal side by side with otherpatrons or with library staff, a library could provide filteredaccess at terminals that lack privacy screens, when patrons wishto use a terminal with others. Alternatively, a library canreserve terminals outside of patrons' sight lines for groups ofpatrons who wish unfiltered access.\n\nWe therefore conclude that the government has failed to showthat the less restrictive alternatives discussed above areineffective at furthering the government's interest either inpreventing patrons from using library computers to access visualdepictions that are obscene, child pornography, or in the caseof minors, harmful to minors, or in preventing library patronsfrom being unwillingly exposed to patently offensive, sexuallyexplicit speech.\n\nD. Do CIPA's Disabling Provisions Cure the Defect?\n\nThe Government argues that even if the use of software filtersmandated by CIPA blocks a substantial amount of speech whosesuppression serves no legitimate state interest, and thereforefails strict scrutiny's narrow tailoring requirement, CIPA'sdisabling provisions cure any lack of narrow tailoring inherentin filtering technology. The disabling provision applicable tolibraries receiving LSTA grants states that \"[a]n administrator,supervisor, or other authority may disable a technologyprotection measure . . . to enable access for bona fide researchor other lawful purposes.\" CIPA § 1712(a)(2) (codified at20 U.S.C. § 9134(f)(3)). CIPA's disabling provision with respect tolibraries receiving E-rate discounts similarly states that \"[a]nadministrator, supervisor, or other person authorized by thecertifying authority . . . may disable the technology protectionmeasure concerned, during use by an adult, to enable access forbona fide research or other lawful purpose.\" CIPA § 1721(b)(codified at 47 U.S.C. § 254(h)(6)(D)).\n\nTo determine whether the disabling provisions cure CIPA's lackof narrow tailoring, we must first determine, as a matter ofstatutory construction, under what circumstances the disablingprovisions permit libraries to disable the softwarefilters.\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e33\u003c/span\u003eIt is unclear to us whether CIPA's disabling provisions permitlibraries to disable the filters any time a patron wishes toaccess speech that is neither obscenity, child pornography, orin the case of a minor patron, material that is harmful tominors. Whether CIPA permits disabling in such instances dependson the meaning of the provisions' reference to \"bona fideresearch or other lawful purpose.\" On the one hand, the language\"to enable access for bona fide research or other lawfulpurpose\" could be interpreted to mean \"to enable access to allconstitutionally protected material.\" As a textual matter, thisreading of the disabling provisions is plausible. If a patronseeks access to speech that is constitutionally protected, thenit is reasonable to conclude that the patron has a \"lawfulpurpose,\" since the dissemination and receipt ofconstitutionally protected speech cannot be made unlawful.\n\nMoreover, since a narrower construction of the disablingprovision creates more constitutional problems than aconstruction of the disabling provisions that permits access toall constitutionally protected speech, the broaderinterpretation is preferable. \"[I]f an otherwise acceptableconstruction of a statute would raise serious constitutionalproblems, and where an alternative interpretation of the statuteis fairly possible, we are obligated to construe the statute toavoid such problems.\" INS v. St. Cyr, 533 U.S. 289, 121 S.Ct.2271, 2279, 150 L.Ed.2d 347 (2001) (internal quotation marks andcitations omitted). On the other hand, interpreting CIPA'sdisabling provisions to permit disabling for access to allconstitutionally protected speech presents several problems.First, if \"other lawful purpose\" means \"for the purpose ofaccessing constitutionally protected speech,\" then this readingrenders superfluous CIPA's reference to \"bona fide research,\"which clearly contemplates some purpose beyond simply accessingconstitutionally protected speech. In general, \"courts shoulddisfavor interpretations of statutes that render languagesuperfluous.\" Conn. Nat'l Bank v. Germain, 503 U.S. 249, 253,112 S.Ct. 1146, 117 L.Ed.2d 391 (1992).\n\nFurthermore, Congress is clearly capable of explicitlyspecifying categories of constitutionally unprotected speech, asit did when it drafted CIPA to require funding recipients to usetechnology protection measures that protect against visualdepictions that are \"obscene,\" \"child pornography,\" or, in thecase of minors, \"harmful to minors.\" CIPA § 1712(a) (codified at20 U.S.C. § 9134(f)(1)(A)(i)(I)-(III)); CIPA § 1721(b) (codifiedat 47 U.S.C. § 254(h)(6)(B)(i)(I)-(III)). If Congress intendedCIPA's disabling provisions simply to permit libraries todisable the filters to allow access to speech falling outside ofthese categories, Congress could have drafted the disablingprovisions with greater precision, expressly permittinglibraries to disable the filters \"to enable access for anymaterial that is not obscene, child pornography, or in the caseof minors, harmful to minors,\" rather than \"to enable access forbona fide research or other lawful purposes,\" which is thelanguage that Congress actually chose.\n\nAt bottom, however, we need not definitively construe CIPA'sdisabling provisions, since it suffices in this case to assumewithout deciding that the disabling provisions permit librariesto allow a patron access to any speech that isconstitutionally protected with respect to that patron. Althoughthis interpretation raises fewer constitutional problems than anarrower interpretation, this interpretation of the disablingprovisions nonetheless fails to cure CIPA's lack of narrowtailoring. Even if the disabling provisions permit publiclibraries to allow patrons to access speech that isconstitutionally protected yet erroneously blocked by thesoftware filters, the requirement that library patrons ask astate actor's permission to access disfavored content violatesthe First Amendment.\n\nThe Supreme Court has made clear that content-basedrestrictions that require recipients to identify themselvesbefore being granted access to disfavored speech are subject tono less scrutiny than outright bans on access to such speech. InLamont v. Postmaster General, 381 U.S. 301, 85 S.Ct. 1493, 14L.Ed.2d 398 (1965), for example, the Court held that a federalstatute requiring the Postmaster General to halt delivery ofcommunist propaganda unless the addressee affirmativelyrequested the material violated the First Amendment:\n\nWe rest on the narrow ground that the addressee in order to receive his mail must request in writing that it be delivered. This; amounts in our judgment to an unconstitutional abridgment of the addressee's First Amendment rights. The addressee carries an affirmative obligation which we do not think the Government may impose on him. This requirement is almost certain to have a deterrent effect, especially as respects those who have sensitive positions.\n\nId. at 307, 85 S.Ct. 1493.\n\nSimilarly, in Denver Area Educational TelecommunicationsConsortium, Inc. v. FCC, 518 U.S. 727, 116 S.Ct. 2374, 135L.Ed.2d 888 (1996), the Court held unconstitutional a federallaw requiring cable operators to allow access to patentlyoffensive, sexually explicit programming only to thosesubscribers who requested access to the programming in advanceand in writing. Id. at 732-33, 116 S.Ct. 2374. As in Lamont,the Court in Denver reasoned that this content-basedrestriction on recipients' access to speech would have animpermissible chilling effect: \"[T]he written notice requirementwill . . . restrict viewing by subscribers who fear for theirreputations should the operator, advertently or inadvertently,disclose the list of those who wish to watch the `patently oftfensive' channel.\" Id. at 754, 116 S.Ct. 2374; see alsoFabulous Assocs., Inc. v. Pa. Pub. Util. Comm'n, 896 F.2d 780,785 (3d Cir. 1990) (considering the constitutionality of a statelaw requiring telephone users who wish to listen to sexuallyexplicit telephone messages to apply for an access code toreceive such messages, and invalidating the law on the groundthat \"[a]n identification requirement exerts an inhibitoryeffect\").\n\nWe believe that CIPA's disabling provisions suffer from thesame flaws as the restrictions on speech in Lamont, Denver,and Fabulous Associates. By requiring library patronsaffirmatively to request permission to access certain speechsingled out on the basis of its content, CIPA will deter patronsfrom requesting that a library disable filters to allow thepatron to access speech that is constitutionally protected, yetsensitive in nature. As we explain above, we find that librarypatrons will be reluctant and hence unlikely to ask permissionto access, for example, erroneously blocked Web sites containinginformation about sexually transmitted diseases, sexualidentity, certain medical conditions, and a variety of othertopics. As discussed in our findings of fact, software filtersblock access to a wide range of constitutionally protectedspeech,including Web sites containing information that individuals arelikely to wish to access anonymously.\n\nThat library patrons will be deterred from asking permissionto access Web sites containing certain kinds of content isevident as a matter of common sense as well as amply borne outby the trial record. Plaintiff Emmalyn Rood, who used theInternet at a public library to research information relating toher sexual identity, testified that she would have beenunwilling as a young teen to ask a librarian to disablefiltering software so that she could view materials concerninggay and lesbian issues.\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e34\u003c/span\u003e Similarly, plaintiff Mark Brownstated that he would have been too embarrassed to ask alibrarian to disable filtering software if it had impeded hisability to research surgery options for his mother when she wastreated for breast cancer.\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e35\u003c/span\u003e As explained in our findingsof fact, see supra at Subsection II.D.2.b, the reluctance ofpatrons to request permission to access Web sites that wereerroneously blocked is further established by the low number ofpatron unblocking requests, relative to the number oferroneously blocked Web sites, in those public libraries thatuse software filters and permit patrons to request access toincorrectly blocked Web sites. Cf. Fabulous Assocs., 896 F.2dat 786 (\"On the record before us, there is more than enoughevidence to support the district court's finding that accesscodes will chill the exercise of some users' right to hearprotected communications.\").\n\nTo be sure, the government demonstrated that it is possiblefor libraries to permit patrons to request anonymously that aparticular Web site be unblocked. In particular, the TacomaPublic Library has configured its computers to present patronswith the option, each time the software filter blocks theiraccess to a Web page, of sending an anonymous email to librarystaff requesting that the page be unblocked. Moreover, a librarystaff member periodically scans logs of URLs blocked by thefilters, in an effort to identify erroneously blocked sites,which the library will subsequently unblock. Although a publiclibrary's ability to permit anonymous unblocking requestsaddresses the deterrent effect of requiring patrons to identifythemselves before gaining access to a particular Web site, webelieve that it fails adequately to address the overblockingproblem.\n\nIn particular, even allowing anonymous requests for unblockingburdens patrons' access to speech, since such requests cannotimmediately be acted on. Although the Tacoma Public Library, forexample, attempts to review requests for unblocking within 24hours, requests sometimes are not reviewed for several days. Anddelays are inevitable in libraries with branches that lack thestaff necessary immediately to review patron unblockingrequests.Because many Internet users \"surf\" the Web, visiting hundreds ofWeb sites in a single session and spending only a short periodof time viewing many of the sites, the requirement that a patrontake the time to affirmatively request access to a blocked Website and then wait several days until the site is unblockedwill, as a practical matter, impose a significant burden onlibrary patrons' use of the Internet. Indeed, a patron's timespent requesting access to an erroneously blocked Web site andchecking to determine whether access was eventually granted islikely to exceed the amount of time the patron would haveactually spent viewing the site, had the site not beenerroneously blocked. This delay is especially burdensome in viewof many libraries' practice of limiting their patrons to a halfhour or an hour of Internet use per day, given the scarcity ofterminal time in relation to patron demand.\n\nThe burden of requiring library patrons to ask permission toview Web sites whose content is disfavored resembles the burdenthat the Supreme Court found unacceptable in Denver, whichinvalidated a federal law requiring cable systems operators toblock subscribers' access to channels containing sexuallyexplicit programming, unless subscribers requested unblocking inadvance. The Court reasoned that \"[t]hese restrictions willprevent programmers from broadcasting to viewers who selectprograms day by day (or, through `surfing,' minute byminute). . . .\" Denver, 518 U.S. at 754, 116 S.Ct. 2374.Similarly, in Fabulous Associates, the Third Circuit explainedthat a law preventing adults from listening to sexually explicitphone messages unless they applied in advance for access to suchmessages would burden adults' receipt of constitutionallyprotected speech, given consumers' tendency to purchase suchspeech on impulse. See Fabulous Assocs., 896 F.2d at 785(noting that officers of two companies that sell access tosexually explicit recorded phone messages \"testified that it isusually `impulse callers' who utilize these types of services,and that people will not call if they must apply for an accesscode\").\n\nIn sum, in many cases, as we have noted above, library patronswho have been wrongly denied access to a Web site will declineto ask the library to disable the filters so that the patron canaccess the Web site. Moreover, even if patrons requestedunblocking every time a site is erroneously blocked, and even iflibrary staff granted every such request, a public library's useof blocking software would still impermissibly burden patrons'access to speech based on its content. The First Amendmentjurisprudence of the Supreme Court and the Third Circuit makesclear that laws imposing content-based burdens on access tospeech are no less offensive to the First Amendment than lawsimposing content-based prohibitions on speech:\n\nIt is of no moment that the statute does not impose a complete prohibition. The distinction between laws burdening and laws banning speech is but a matter of degree. The Government's contentbased burdens must satisfy the same rigorous scrutiny as its content-based bans. . . . When the purpose and design of a statute is to regulate speech by reason of its content, special consideration or latitude is not afforded to the Government merely because the law can somehow be described as a burden rather than outright suppression.\n\nUnited States v. Playboy Entm't Group, Inc., 529 U.S. 803,812, 826, 120 S.Ct. 1878, 146 L.Ed.2d 865 (2000) (invalidating afederal law requiring cable television operators to limit thetransmission of sexually explicit programming to the hoursbetween 10:00 p.m. and 6:00 a.m.); see also Fabulous Assocs.,896 F.2d at 785 (\"[H]ere . . . there is no outright prohibitionof indecentcommunication. However, the First Amendment protects againstgovernment inhibition as well as prohibition.\") (internalquotation marks and citation omitted).\n\nEven if CIPA's disabling provisions could be perfectlyimplemented by library staff every time patrons request accessto an erroneously blocked Web site, we hold that thecontent-based burden that the library's use of software filtersplaces on patrons' access to speech suffers from the sameconstitutional deficiencies as a complete ban on patrons' accessto speech that was erroneously blocked by filters, since patronswill often be deterred from asking the library to unblock a siteand patron requests cannot be immediately reviewed. We thereforehold that CIPA's disabling provisions fail to cure CIPA's lackof narrow tailoring.\n\nVI. Conclusion; Severability\n\nBased upon the foregoing discussion, we hold that a publiclibrary's content-based restriction on patrons' access to speechon the Internet is subject to strict scrutiny. Every item in alibrary's print collection has been selected because librarystaff, or a party to whom staff delegates the decision, deemsthe content to be particularly valuable. In contrast, theInternet, as a forum, is open to any member of the public tospeak, and hence, even when a library provides filtered Internetaccess, it creates a public forum in which the vast majority ofthe speech has been reviewed by neither librarians nor filteringcompanies. Under public forum doctrine, where the state createssuch a forum open to any member of the public to speak on anunlimited number of subjects, the state's decision selectivelyto exclude certain speech on the basis of its content, issubject to strict scrutiny, since such exclusions riskdistorting the marketplace of ideas that the state has created.\n\nApplication of strict scrutiny to public libraries'content-based restrictions on their patrons' access to theInternet finds further support in the analogy to traditionalpublic fora, such as sidewalks, parks, and squares, in whichcontent-based restrictions on speech are always subject tostrict scrutiny. Like these traditional public fora, Internetaccess in public libraries uniquely promotes First Amendmentvalues, by offering low barriers to entry to speakers andlisteners. The content of speech on the Internet is as diverseas human thought, and the extent to which the Internet promotesFirst Amendment values is evident from the sheer breadth ofspeech that this new medium enables.\n\nTo survive strict scrutiny, a public library's use offiltering software must be narrowly tailored to further acompelling state interest, and there must be no less restrictivealternative that could effectively further that interest. Wefind that, given the crudeness of filtering technology, anytechnology protection measure mandated by CIPA will necessarilyblock access to a substantial amount of speech whose suppressionserves no legitimate government interest. This lack of narrowtailoring cannot be cured by CIPA's disabling provisions,because patrons will often be deterred from asking the library'spermission to access an erroneously blocked Web page, andanonymous requests for unblocking cannot be acted on withoutdelaying the patron's access to the blocked Web page, therebyimpermissibly burdening access to speech on the basis of itscontent.\n\nMoreover, less restrictive alternatives exist to further apublic library's legitimate interests in preventing itscomputers from being used to access obscenity, childpornography, or in the case of minors, material harmful tominors, and in preventing patrons from being unwillingly exposedto patently offensive, sexually explicit speech.Libraries may use a variety of means to monitor their patrons'use of the Internet and impose sanctions on patrons who violatethe library's Internet use policy. To protect minors frommaterial harmful to minors, libraries could grant minorsunfiltered access only if accompanied by a parent, or uponparental consent, or could require minors to use unfilteredterminals in view of library staff. To prevent patrons frombeing unwillingly exposed to offensive, sexually explicitcontent, libraries can offer patrons the option of usingblocking software, can place unfiltered terminals outside ofpatrons' sight lines, and can use privacy screens and recessedmonitors. While none of these less restrictive alternatives areperfect, the government has failed to show that they aresignificantly less effective than filtering software, whichitself fails to block access to large amounts of speech thatfall within the categories sought to be blocked.\n\nIn view of the severe limitations of filtering technology andthe existence of these less restrictive alternatives, weconclude that it is not possible for a public library to complywith CIPA without blocking a very substantial amount ofconstitutionally protected speech, in violation of the FirstAmendment. Because this conclusion derives from the inherentlimits of the filtering technology mandated by CIPA, it holdsfor any library that complies with CIPA's conditions. Hence,even under the stricter standard of facial invalidity proposedby the government, which would require us to uphold CIPA if onlya single library can comply with CIPA's conditions withoutviolating the First Amendment, we conclude that CIPA is faciallyinvalid, since it will induce public libraries, as state actors,to violate the First Amendment. Because we hold that CIPA isinvalid on these grounds, we need not reach the plaintiffs'alternative theories that CIPA is invalid as a prior restrainton speech and is unconstitutionally vague. Nor need we decidewhether CIPA is invalid because it requires public libraries, asa condition on the receipt of federal funds, to relinquish theirown First Amendment rights to provide the public with unfilteredInternet access, a theory that we nonetheless feel constrainedto discuss (at length) in the margin.\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e36\u003c/span\u003e\n\nHaving determined that CIPA violates the First Amendment, wewould usually be required to determine whether CIPA is severablefrom the remainder of the statutes governing LSTA and E-ratefunding. Neither party, however, has advanced the argument thatCIPA is not severable from the remainder the Library Servicesand Technology Act and Communications Act of 1934 (the twostatutes governing LSTA and E-rate funding, respectively), andat all events, we think that CIPA is severable.\n\n\"The inquiry into whether a statute is severable isessentially an inquiry into legislative intent.\" Minn. v. MilleLacs Band of Chippewa Indians, 526 U.S. 172, 191, 119 S.Ct.1187, 143 L.Ed.2d 270 (1999). \"Unless it is evident that thelegislature would not have enacted those provisions which arewithin its power, independently of that which is not, theinvalid partmay be dropped if what is left is fully operative as a law.\"Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U.S. 1, 108, 96 S.Ct. 612, 46 L.Ed.2d659 (1976) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).There is no doubt that if we were to strike CIPA from thesections of the United States Code where it is currentlycodified, the remaining statutory sections, providing eligiblepublic libraries with E-rate discounts and LSTA grants, would befully operative as law. Indeed, the LSTA and E-rate programsexisted prior to the enactment of CIPA in substantially the sameform as they would exist were we to strike CIPA and leave therest of the programs intact.\n\nThe second question, whether Congress would in this case havechosen to repeal the LSTA and E-rate subsidy programs instead ofcontinuing to fund them if it had known that CIPA's limitationson these programs were constitutionally invalid, is less clear.CIPA contains \"separability\" clauses that state that if any ofits additions to the statutes governing the LSTA and E-rateprograms are found to be unconstitutional, Congress intended toeffectuate as much of CIPA's amendments as possible.\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e37\u003c/span\u003e Weinterpret these clauses to mean, for example, that if a courtwere to find that CIPA's requirements are unconstitutional withrespect to adult patrons, but permissible with respect tominors, that Congress intended to have the court effectuate onlythe provisions with respect to minors. These separabilityclauses do not speak to the situation before us, however, wherewe have found that CIPA is facially unconstitutional in itsentirety.\n\nNevertheless, the government has not pointed to anything inthe legislative history or elsewhere to suggest that Congressintended to discontinue funding under the LSTA and E-rateprograms unless it could effectuate CIPA's restrictions on thefunding. And Congress's decision, prior to CIPA's enactment, tosubsidize Internet access through the LSTA and E-rate programswithout such restrictions, counsels that we reach the oppositeconclusion. At bottom, we think that it is unclear whatCongress's intent was on this point, and in the absence of suchinformation, we exercise a presumption in favor of severability.Regan v. Time, Inc., 468 U.S. 641, 653, 104 S.Ct. 3262, 82L.Ed.2d 487 (1984) (\"[T]he presumption is in favor ofseverability.\"); cf. Velazquez v.

Plaintiffs advance three other alternative, independentgrounds for holding CIPA facially invalid. First, they submitthat even if CIPA will not induce public libraries to violatethe First Amendment, CIPA nonetheless imposes anunconstitutional condition on public libraries by requiring themto relinquish their own First Amendment rights to provideunfiltered Internet access as a condition on their receipt offederal funds. See infra n. 36. Second, plaintiffs contendthat CIPA is facially invalid because it effects animpermissible prior restraint on speech by granting filteringcompanies and library staff unfettered discretion to suppressspeech before it has been received by library patrons and beforeit has been subject to a judicial determination that it isunprotected under the First Amendment. See SoutheasternPromotions, Ltd. v. Conrad, 420 U.S. 546, 558, 95 S.Ct. 1239,43 L.Ed.2d 448 (1975). Finally, plaintiffs submit that CIPA isunconstitutionally vague. See City of Chicago v.

Theseplaintiffs are faced with the impending choice of eithercertifying compliance with CIPA by July 1, 2002, or foregoingsubsidies under the LSTA and E-rate programs, and thereforeclearly have standing to challenge the constitutionality of theconditions to which they will be subject should they accept thesubsidies.

If separate patrons attempted to reach the same Web site,or one or more patrons attempted to access more than one page ona single Web site, Finnell counted these attempts as a singleblock.

The standard method of quantifying the rateof underblocking would divide the number of sites in the samplethat the filter incorrectly failed to block by the number ofsites in the sample that the filter should have blocked,yielding an underblocking rate in this example of 20%. Finnell'sstudy, however, calculated the underblocking rate by dividingthe number of sites that the filter incorrectly failed to blockby the total number of sites in the sample that were not blocked(whether correctly or incorrectly) yielding an underblockingrate in this example of only .2%.\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003e13.

In February and March 2002 herepeated his testing of the 6,777 URLs originally found to beblocked by at least one of the blocking products, in order todetermine whether and to what extent the blocking productvendors had corrected the mistakes that he publicized. Of thoseURLs blocked by N2H2 in the October 2001 testing, 55.10%remained blocked when tested by Edelman in March 2002.

Because the resultsposted to his Web site were accessed by an employee ofSurfControl (as evidenced by Edelman's records of who wasaccessing his Web site), we infer that Cyber Patrol haddetermined that 93% of all 6,777 pages, or 6,302 Web pages, wereoriginally wrongly blocked by the product.\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003e17.

Because the sites that Ryanreviewed were not selected randomly (i.e., they were chosen byplaintiffs' counsel), his study says little about the characterof the set of 6,777 sites that Edelman compiled, or the totalamount of overblocking by the four filtering programs thatEdelman used.\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003eAnne Lipow, a practicing librarian for more than 30 years andthe director of a library consulting firm, also reviewed thesame list of 204 URLs from the set that Edelman had collectedfor their appropriateness for a library's collection. Shecategorized sites in four different levels according to theirappropriateness for a public library's collection. Again,because these URLs were not selected randomly, Lipow's study isnot particularly relevant to the total set that Edelmancompiled, or to the total amount of overblocking by the fourfiltering programs that Edelman used.\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003eAlthough the methodology used to select the list of Web pagesthat was forwarded to Ryan and Lipow is problematic, Ryan's andLipow's testimony established that many of the erroneouslyblocked sites that Edelman identified would be useful andappropriate sources of information for library patrons.\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003e18. All of the reviewers that Janes recruited had somerelevant experience in library reference services or librarycollection development. Janes divided the reviewers into twogroups, a group of 11 less experienced reviewers, and a group offive more experienced reviewers. Janes assigned the lessexperienced group to do a first-round review with the purpose ofidentifying the most obviously overblocked sites. The moreexperienced group was to review the remaining sites (i.e., thosethat were not obviously overblocked) and to make final decisionsregarding these sites.\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003eIn the first round, each person evaluated two sets of around80 sites, and each group was evaluated by two different people.Each set of sites included the following instructions:\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003eLook carefully at each of the Web sites on the list.

For this last criterion, we recognize that you might not refer a young child to a Calculus site just because it would not be useful to that child, but you should ignore that factor.

[P]atrons at a library do not have the right to makeeditorial decisions regarding the availability of certainmaterial. It is the exclusive authority of the library to makeaffirmative decisions regarding what books, magazines, or othermaterial is placed on library shelves, or otherwise madeavailable to patrons. Libraries impose many restrictions on theuse of their systems which demonstrate that the content of thelibrary's offerings are not determined by the general public. S.Rep.

In distinguishing restrictions on public libraries' printcollections from restrictions on the provision of Internetaccess, we do not rely on the rationale adopted in MainstreamLoudoun v. Board of Trustees of the Loudoun County Library,2 F. Supp.2d 783 (E.D.Va. 1998). The Loudoun Court reasoned thata library's decision to block certain Web sites fundamentallydiffers from its decision to carry certain books but not others,in that unlike the money and shelf space consumed by thelibrary's provision of print materials, \"no appreciableexpenditure of library time or resources is required to make aparticular Internet publication available\" once the library hasacquired Internet access. Id. at 793-94.\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003eWe disagree. Nearly every librarian who testified at trialstated that patrons' demand for Internet access exceeds thelibrary's supply of Internet terminals. Under suchcircumstances, every time library patrons visit a Web site, theydeny other patrons waiting to use the terminal access to otherWeb sites. Just as the scarcity of a library's budget and shelfspace constrains a library's ability to provide its patrons withunrestricted access to print materials, the scarcity of time atInternet terminals constrains libraries' ability to providepatrons with unrestricted Internet access:\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003eThe same budget concerns constraining the number of books that libraries can offer also limits the number of terminals, Internet accounts, and speed of access links that can be purchased, and thus the number of Web pages that patrons can view. This is clear to anyone who has been denied access to a Website because no terminal was unoccupied.\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003eMark S.

We have found that approximately 14.3 million Americansaccess the Internet at a public library, and Internet access atpublic libraries is more often used by those with lower incomesthan those with higher incomes. We found that about 20.3% ofInternet users with household family income of less than $15,000per year use public libraries for Internet access, andapproximately 70% of libraries serving communities with povertylevels in excess of 40% receive E-rate discounts. The widespreadavailability of Internet access in public libraries is due, inpart, to the availability of public funding, including state andlocal funding and the federal funding programs regulated byCIPA.\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003e27. We acknowledge that traditional public fora havecharacteristics that promote First Amendment values in ways thatthe provision of Internet access in public libraries does not.For example, a significant virtue of traditional public fora istheir facilitation of face-to-face communication. \"In aface-to-face encounter there is a greater opportunity for theexchange of ideas and the propagation of views. . . .\"Cornelius, 473 U.S. at 798, 105 S.Ct. 3439. Face-to-faceexchanges also permit speakers to confront listeners who wouldotherwise not actively seek out the information that the speakerhas to offer. In contrast, the Internet operates largely byproviding individuals with only that information that theyactively seek out. Although the Internet does not permitface-to-face communication in the same way that traditionalpublic fora do, the Internet, as a medium of expression, issignificantly more interactive than the broadcast media and thepress. \"[T]he Web makes it possible to establish two-waylinkages with potential sympathizers.

To the extent that filtering software is effective inidentifying URLs of Web pages containing obscenity or childpornography, libraries may use filtering software as a tool foridentifying URLs in their Internet use logs that fall withinthese categories, without requiring patrons to use filteringsoftware. As the study of Benjamin Edelman, an expert witnessfor the plaintiffs, demonstrates, it is possible to developsoftware that automatically tests a list of URLs, such as thelist of URLs in a public library's Internet use logs, todetermine whether any of those URLs would be blocked by aparticular software filter as falling within a particularcategory. Alternatively, library staff can review the Internetuse logs by hand, skimming the list of URLs for those that arelikely to correspond to Web pages containing obscenity or childpornography, as is the practice of Tacoma's David Biek, whotestified as a government witness. Under either method, publiclibraries can assure patrons of their privacy by tracing a givenURL to a particular patron only after determining that the URLcorresponds to a Web site whose content is illegal.\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003e32.

Whereas the disabling provision applicable to librariesthat receive LSTA grants permits disabling for both adults andminors, the disabling provision applicable to libraries thatreceive E-rate discounts permits disabling only during adultuse.

Although in light of our disposition of the plaintiffs'Dole claim, we do not rule upon plaintiffs' contention thatCIPA's conditioning of funds on the installation of filteringsoftware violates the doctrine of unconstitutional conditions,we are mindful of the need to frame the disputed legal issuesand to develop a full factual record for the certain appeal tothe Supreme Court. Cf. Ashcroft v. ACLU, ___ U.S. ___, 122S.Ct. 1700, ___ L.Ed.2d ___ (2002) (remanding the case to theCourt of Appeals to review the legal and factual bases on whichthe District Court granted plaintiffs' motion for a preliminaryinjunction after vacating its opinion that relied on a differentground from the ones used by the District Court). Although we donot decide the plaintiffs' unconstitutional conditions claim, wethink that our findings of fact on public libraries, their useof the Internet, and the technological limitations of Internetfiltering software, see supra Subsections II.D E, and ourframing of the legal issue here, would allow the Supreme Courtto decide the issue if it deems it necessary to resolve thiscase.\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003eThe doctrine of unconstitutional conditions \"holds that thegovernment `may not deny a benefit to a person on a basis thatinfringes his constitutionally protected . . . freedom ofspeech' even if he has no entitlement to that benefit.\" Bd. ofCounty Comm'rs v.

In this case,the plaintiffs argue that CIPA imposes an unconstitutionalcondition on libraries who receive E-rate and LSTA subsidies byrequiring them, as a condition on their receipt of federalfunds, to surrender their First Amendment right to provide thepublic with access to constitutionally protected speech. Underthis theory, even if it does not violate the First Amendment fora public library to use filtering software, it nonethelessviolates the First Amendment for the federal government torequire public libraries to use filters as a condition of thereceipt of federal funds.\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003eThe government contends that this case does not fall under theunconstitutional conditions framework because: (1) as stateactors, the recipients of the funds (the public libraries) arenot protected by the First Amendment, and therefore are notbeing asked to relinquish any constitutionally protected rights:and (2) although library patrons are undoubtedly protected bythe First Amendment, they are not the funding recipients in thiscase, and libraries may not rely on their patrons' rights inorder to state an unconstitutional conditions claim.\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003eIt is an open question in this Circuit whether Congress mayviolate the First Amendment by restricting the speech of publicentities, such as municipalities or public libraries. The onlyU.S. Supreme Court opinion to weigh in on the issue is aconcurrence by Justice Stewart, joined by Chief Justice Burgerand Justice Rehnquist, in which he opined that municipalitiesand other arms of the state are not protected by the FirstAmendment from governmental interference with their expression.See Colum. Broad. Sys., Inc. v. Democratic Nat'l Comm.,412 U.S. 94, 139, 93 S.Ct. 2080, 36 L.Ed.2d 772 (1973) (Stewart, J.,concurring) (\"The First Amendment protects the press fromgovernmental interference; it confers no analogous protectionon the Government.\"); see also id. at 139 n. 7, 93 S.Ct.2080 (\"The purpose of the First Amendment is to protect privateexpression and nothing in the guarantee precludes the governmentfrom controlling its own expression or that of its agents.\")(quoting Thomas Emerson, The System of Freedom of Expression700 (1970) (internal quotation marks omitted)). The Court hassubsequently made it clear, however, that it considers it to bean open question whether municipalities acting in their capacityas employers have First Amendment rights, suggesting that thequestion whether public entities are ever protected by the FirstAmendment also remains open. See City of Madison Joint Sch.Dist. No. 8 v. Wisc. Employment Relations Comm'n, 429 U.S. 167,175 n. 7, S.Ct. 421, 50 L.Ed.2d 376 (1976) (\"We need not decidewhether a municipal corporation as an employer has FirstAmendment rights to hear the views of its citizens andemployees.\").\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003eSeveral courts of appeals have cited Justice Stewart'sconcurrence in Columbia Broadcasting Systems and have, withlittle discussion or analysis, concluded that a \"government. . . speaker is not itself protected by the first amendment.\"Warner Cable Communications, Inc. v.

This difficulty is demonstrated by thereasoning of the Seventh Circuit in a case in which that courtconsidered whether municipalities are protected by the FirstAmendment and noted that it is an open question that couldplausibly be answered in the affirmative, yet declined to decideit:\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003eOnly a few cases address the question whether municipalities or other state subdivisions or agencies have any First Amendment rights. . . . The question is an open one in this circuit, and we do not consider the answer completely free from doubt. For many purposes, for example diversity jurisdiction and Fourteenth Amendment liability, municipalities are treated by the law as if they were persons. Monell v. Department of Social Services, 436 U.S. 658, 690, 98 S.Ct. 2018, 56 L.Ed.2d 611 (1978); Moor v. County of Alameda, 411 U.S. 693, 717-18, 93 S.Ct. 1785, 36 L.Ed.2d 596 (1973). There is at least an argument that the marketplace of ideas would be unduly curtailed if municipalities could not freely express themselves on matters of public concern, including the subsidization of housing and the demographic makeup of the community.\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003eTo the extent, moreover, that a municipality is the voice of its residents — is, indeed, a megaphone amplifying voices that might not otherwise be audible — a curtailment of its right to speak might be thought a curtailment of the unquestioned First Amendment rights of those residents. See Meir Dan Cohen, \"Freedoms of Collective Speech: A Theory of Protected Communications by Organizations, Communities, and the State,\" 79 Calif.L.Rev. 1229, 1261-63 (1991); cf. Student Government Ass'n v. Board of Trustees, supra, 868 F.2d at 482. Thus if federal law imposed a fine on municipalities that passed resolutions condemning abortion, one might suppose that a genuine First Amendment issue would be presented. Against this suggestion can be cited the many cases which hold that municipalities lack standing to invoke the Fourteenth Amendment against actions by the state. E.g., Coleman v. Miller, 307 U.S. 433, 441, 59 S.Ct. 972, 83 L.Ed. 1385 (1939); Williams v. Mayor \u0026 City Council of Baltimore, 289 U.S. 36, 40, 53 S.Ct. 431, 77 L.Ed. 1015 (1933); City of East St. Louis v. Circuit Court for the Twentieth Judicial Circuit, 986 F.2d 1142, 1144 (7th Cir. 1993). But it is one thing to hold that a municipality cannot interpose the Fourteenth Amendment between itself and the state of which it is the creature, Anderson v. City of Boston, 376 Mass. 178, 380 N.E.2d 628, 637-38 (1978), appeal dismissed for want of a substantial federal question, 439 U.S. 1060, 99 S.Ct. 822, 59 L.Ed.2d 26 (1979), and another to hold that a municipality has no rights against the federal government or another state. River Vale Tp. v. Town of Orangetown, 403 F.2d 684, 686 (2d Cir. 1968), distinguishes between these two types of cases.\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003eCreek v. Village of Westhaven, 80 F.3d 186, 192-93 (7th Cir.1996).\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003eWe also note that there is no textual support in the FirstAmendment for distinguishing between, for example, municipalcorporations, and private corporations, which the Court hasrecognized have cognizable First Amendment rights. First Nat'lBank of Boston v. Bellotti, 435 U.S. 765, 775-76, 98 S.Ct.1407, 55 L.Ed.2d 707 (1978). Unlike other provisions in the Billof Rights, which the Supreme Court has held to be \"purelypersonal\" and thus capable of being invoked only by individuals,the First Amendment is not phrased in terms of who holds theright, but rather what is protected. Compare U.S. Const. amendv. (\"No person shall be held to answer . . .\") (emphasisadded) with U.S. Const. amend I (\"Congress shall make no law. . . abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press. . . .\");see also United States v. White, 322 U.S. 694, 698-701, 64S.Ct. 1248, 88 L.Ed. 1542 (1944) (holding that the privilegeagainst self-incrimination applies only to natural persons).\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003eThe Supreme Court relied on this distinction (i.e., that theFirst Amendment protects a class of speech rather than a classof speakers) in a similar context in Bellotti. There, theCourt invalidated a Massachusetts statute that prohibitedcorporations from spending money to influence ballot initiativesthat did not bear directly on their \"property, business orassets.\" Id. at 768, 98 S.Ct. 1407. In so holding, the Courtrejected the argument that the First Amendment protects only anindividual's expression. The Court wrote:\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003eThe Constitution often protects interests broader than those of the party seeking their vindication. . . . The proper question therefore is not whether corporations \"have\" First Amendment rights and, if so, whether they are coextensive with those of natural persons. Instead, the question must be whether [the government is] abridg[ing] expression that the First Amendment was meant to protect.\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003eId. at 776, 98 S.Ct. 1407. The Court thus concluded thatcorporations are entitled to assert First Amendment claims asspeakers, noting that \"[t]he inherent worth of the speech interms of its capacity for informing the public does not dependupon the identity of its source, whether corporation,association, union, or individual.\" Id. at 777, 98 S.Ct. 1407.\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003eIn view of the foregoing, the notion that public libraries mayassert First Amendment rights for the purpose of making anunconstitutional conditions claim is clearly plausible, and maywell be correct. But even if it is not, we think it plausiblethat they could rely on their patrons' rights, even though theirpatrons are not the ones who are directly receiving the federalfunding. In similar cases, the Supreme Court has entertainedunconstitutional conditions claims both by the organizationsthat receive federal funding and by their constituents. SeeLegal Servs. Corp. v. Velazquez, 531 U.S. 533, 537, 121 S.Ct.1043, 149 L.Ed.2d 63 (2001) (\"Lawyers employed by New York CityLSC grantees, together with private LSC contributors, LSCindigent clients, and various state and local public officialswhose governments contribute to LSC grantees, brought suit . . .to declare the restriction [on LSC lawyers' ability advocate theamendment of or to challenge the constitutionality of existingwelfare law] . . . invalid.\"); Rust v. Sullivan, 500 U.S. 173,181, 111 S.Ct. 1759, 114 L.Ed.2d 233 (1991) (\"Petitioners areTitle X grantees and doctors who supervise Title X funds suingon behalf of themselves and their patients. . . . Petitionerschallenged the regulations on the grounds that . . . theyviolate the First and Fifth Amendment rights of Title X clientsand the First Amendment rights of Title X health providers.\");FCC v. League of Women Voters of Cal., 468 U.S. 364, 370 n. 6,104 S.Ct. 3106, 82 L.Ed.2d 278 (1984) (reviewing a FirstAmendment challenge to conditions on public broadcasters'receipt of federal funds, in which the plaintiffs included notonly the owner of a public television station, but also viewersof the station's programs, including the League of Women Voters,and \"Congress-man Henry Waxman, . . . a regular listener andviewer of public broadcasting\").\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003eThe question whether CIPA's requirement that libraries usefiltering software constitutes an unconstitutional condition isnot an easy one. The Supreme Court has held that it violates theFirst Amendment for the federal government to require publicbroadcasting stations that receive federal funds not toeditorialize, see League of Women Voters, 468 U.S. at 366,402, 104 S.Ct. 3106; for states to subsidize \"newspaper andreligious, professional, trade, and sports journals,\" but not\"general interest magazines,\" Ark. Writers' Project, Inc. v.Ragland, 481 U.S. 221, 223, 107 S.Ct. 1722, 95 L.Ed.2d 209(1987); for a state university to subsidize student publicationsonly on the condition that they do not \"primarily promote[] ormanifest[] a particular belief in or about a deity or anultimate reality,\" Rosenberger v. Rector \u0026 Visitors of Univ. ofVa., 515 U.S. 819, 823, 115 S.Ct. 2510, 132 L.Ed.2d 700 (1995);and for the federal government to prevent legal servicesproviders who receive federal funds from seeking to \"amend orotherwise challenge existing welfare law.\" Velazquez, 531 U.S.at 537, 121 S.Ct. 1043. On the other hand, the Supreme Court hasheld that it does not violate the First Amendment for thefederal government to require healthcare providers who receivefederal funds not to \"encourage, promote or advocate abortion asa method of family planning,\" Rust, 500 U.S. at 180, 111 S.Ct.1759; for the federal government to subsidize charitableorganizations only if they do not engage in lobbying activity,see Regan v. Taxation with Representation, 461 U.S. 540, 103S.Ct. 1997, 76 L.Ed.2d 129 (1983); and for the NationalEndowment for the Arts, in awarding grants on the basis ofartistic excellence, to \"take into consideration generalstandards of decency and respect for the diverse beliefs andvalues of the American Public.\" NEA v. Finley, 524 U.S. 569,572, 118 S.Ct. 2168, 141 L.Ed.2d 500 (1998).\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003eIn light of the facts that we discuss above regarding theoperation of public libraries, and the limits of Internetfiltering software, see supra Sections II D E, we believe thatthe plaintiffs have a good argument that this case is moreanalogous to League of Women Voters, Arkansas Writers'Project, and Velazquez than it is to Rust, Finley andTaxation with Representation. Like the law invalidated inLeague of Women Voters, which targeted editorializing, and thelaw invalidated in Arkansas Writers' Project, which targetedgeneral interest magazines but not \"religious, professional,trade, and sports journals,\" the law in this case placescontent-based restrictions on public libraries' possible FirstAmendment right to provide patrons with access toconstitutionally protected material. See Arkansas Writers'Project, 481 U.S. at 229, 107 S.Ct. 1722 (\"[T]he basis on whichArkansas differentiates between magazines is particularlyrepugnant to First Amendment principles: a magazine's tax statusdepends entirely on its content. Above all else, the FirstAmendment means that government has no power to restrictexpression because of its message, its ideas, its subjectmatter, or its content.\") (internal quotation marks andcitations omitted); League of Women Voters, 468 U.S. at 383,104 S.Ct. 3106 (\"[T]he scope of [the challenged statute's] banis defined solely on the basis of the content of the suppressedspeech.\"). See generally Rosenberger, 515 U.S. at 828, 115S.Ct. 2510 (\"It is axiomatic that the government may notregulate speech based on its substantive content or the messageit conveys.\"). Because of the technological limitations offiltering software described in such detail above, Congress'srequirement that public libraries use such software is in effecta requirement that public libraries block a substantial amountof constitutionally protected speech on the basis of itscontent.\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003ePlaintiffs' argument that the federal government may notrequire public libraries who receive federal funds to restrictthe availability of constitutionally protected Web sites solelyon the basis of the sites' content finds further support in therole that public libraries have traditionally served inmaintaining First Amendment values. As evidenced by the manypublic libraries that have endorsed the Freedom to ReadStatement and the Library Bill of Rights, see supra SubsectionII. D. 1, public libraries seemingly have a duty to challengeprevailing orthodoxy and make available to the publiccontroversial, yet constitutionally protected material, even ifit means drawing the ire of the community. See Bd. of Educ. v.Pico, 457 U.S. 853, 915, 102 S.Ct. 2799, 73 L.Ed.2d 435 (1982)(Rehnquist, J., dissenting) (noting that \"public libraries\" are\"designed for freewheeling inquiry\").\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003eBy interfering with public libraries' discretion to makeavailable to patrons as wide a range of constitutionallyprotected speech as possible, the federal government is arguablydistorting the usual functioning of public libraries as placesof freewheeling inquiry. The Velazquez Court, in invalidatingthe federal government's restrictions on the ability offederally funded legal services providers to challenge theconstitutionality of welfare laws, relied on the manner in whichthe restrictions that the federal government placed on legalservices' attorneys' speech distorted the usual functioning ofthe judicial system:\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003e[T]he Government seeks to use an existing medium of expression and to control it, in a class of cases, in ways which distort its usual functioning. . . . The First Amendment forb[ids] the Government from using the forum in an unconventional way to suppress speech inherent in the nature of the medium.\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003e531 U.S. at 543, 121 S.Ct. 1043. By the same token, CIPAarguably distorts the usual functioning of public libraries bothby requiring libraries to: (1) deny patrons access toconstitutionally protected speech that libraries would otherwiseprovide to patrons; and (2) delegate decision making to privatesoftware developers who closely guard their selection criteriaas trade secrets and who do not purport to make their decisionson the basis of whether the blocked Web sites areconstitutionally protected or would add value to a publiclibrary's collection.\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003eAt all events, CIPA clearly does not seem to serve the purposeof limiting the extent of government speech given the extremediversity of speech on the Internet. Nor can Congress's decisionto subsidize Internet access be said to promote a governmentalmessage or constitute governmental speech, even under a generousunderstanding of the concept. As the Court noted in Reno v.ACLU, 521 U.S. 844, 117 S.Ct. 2329, 138 L.Ed.2d 874 (1997),\"[i]t is no exaggeration to conclude that the content on theInternet is as diverse as human thought.\" Id. at 852, 117S.Ct. 2329 (internal quotation marks omitted). Even withsoftware filters in place, the sheer breadth of speech availableon the Internet defeats any claim that CIPA is intended tofacilitate the dissemination of governmental speech. Like inVelazquez, \"there is no programmatic message of the kindrecognized in Rust and which sufficed there to allow theGovernment to specify the advice deemed necessary for itslegitimate objectives.\" Velazquez, 531 U.S. at 548, 121 S.Ct.1043.\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003eIn sum, we think that the plaintiffs have good arguments thatthey may assert an unconstitutional conditions claim by relyingeither on the public libraries' First Amendment rights or on therights of their patrons. We also think that the plaintiffs havea good argument that CIPA's requirement that public librariesuse filtering software distorts the usual functioning of publiclibraries in such a way that it constitutes an unconstitutionalcondition on the receipt of funds. We do not decide theseissues, confident that our findings of fact on the functioningof public libraries, their use of the Internet, and thetechnological limitations of Internet filtering software, seesupra Sections II.D E, would allow the Supreme Court to decidethe unconstitutional conditions claim if the Court deems itnecessary.\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003e37. CIPA § 1712(a)(2) contains a provision titled\"Separability,\" which is codified in the Library Services andTechnology Act, 20 U.S.C. § 9134(f)(6), and provides: \"If anyprovision of this subsection is held invalid, the remainder ofthis subsection shall not be affected thereby.\" CIPA section1721(e) also contained a similar provision that applied toE-rate funding, although it was not codified in theCommunications Act. That section, also titled \"Separability,\"provided: \"If any provision of paragraph (5) or (6) of section254(h) of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended by thissection, or the application thereof to any person orcircumstance is held invalid, the remainder of such paragraphand the application of such paragraph to other persons orcircumstances shall not be affected thereby.\" CIPA § 1721(e).\u003c/span\u003e\n\n",
