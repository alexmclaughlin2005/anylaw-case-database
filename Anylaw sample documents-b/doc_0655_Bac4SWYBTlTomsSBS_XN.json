    "body": "This matter is before us to consider major revisions to The Florida Bar Integration Rule, article XI, and amendment to The Florida Bar Integration Rule, article II, section 5(a), which have been proposed by the Supreme Court Special Committee for Lawyer Disciplinary Procedures.*fn* Several major policy decisions were made by the committee which are reflected throughout the recommended changes to article XI. The committee recommends that lay persons should be included in the disciplinary process at the grievance committee level; that, for more expeditious handling of cases, a speedy trial rule should be instituted; that the Board of Governors should be taken out of the adjudicatory phase of the disciplinary process and should be involved only as prosecutor; that there should be absolute immunity for complainants in Bar disciplinary proceedings; that confidentiality should be eliminated after probable cause has been determined to exist; that spot audits by in-house auditors should be instituted; that there should be qualification proceedings to deal with incompetent lawyers; and that circuit judges should serve as referees. We approve the committee's recommendation as they relate to inclusion of lay persons in the disciplinary process, taking the Board of Governors out of the adjudicatory phase of the disciplinary process, use of trial judges as referees, and elimination of confidentiality after probable cause has been determined to exist.\n\nAlthough we approve a major portion of the committee's recommendations, we reject the following proposals which are adequately covered by the present rules. We reject proposed rule 11.02(4)(d),\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e1\u003c/span\u003e dealing with unearned fees and lawyer retainers, providing that money paid to a lawyer for services rendered in the future should not be used until the services are rendered and the fee earned and enumerating exceptions to this rule. Not only do we feel that the situation dealt with by this proposed rule is adequately covered by the present rules, which make it unethical for a lawyer to accept a fee and then fail to do the promised work, but we are also of the opinion that the proposed rule is unworkable. Mechanical application of such a rule seems unfeasible due to the varying circumstances and stages under which a fee is \"earned.\"\n\nWe reject proposed rule 11.02(4)(e),\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e2\u003c/span\u003e entitled \"Staff Auditors and Random Audits,\" which provides that The Florida Bar shall retain staff auditors to conduct random audits. We have recently revised the rules with respect to trust accounting so as to require standard procedures and reporting requirements on the part of members of the Bar. See Fla.Bar Integr.Rule, art. XI, rule 11.02(4)(c). Until these new procedures are tested and determined to be wanting, we decline to assume the need for the substantially more restrictive measures proposed by the committee.\n\nWe reject the proposed major revision of rule 11.04(3),\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e3\u003c/span\u003e which eliminates, at the grievance committee level, the accused attorney's right to confrontation, to cross-examination, to be present during the hearing, and to present evidence although the accused, under the proposed rule, would still have the opportunity to make a statement to the grievance committee in refutation or explanation of the charges. This proposed change was previously rejected by this Court in In the Matter of The Florida Bar, 338 So.2d 205, 207 (Fla.1976), wherein we said:\n\nWe do not feel the rights afforded the accused attorney by Rule 11.04(3) should be sacrificed for the mere purpose of expediency in the processing of his charges.\n\nOur ruling upon the proposal to eliminate confidentiality at certain stages of the grievance procedure makes retention of the present safeguards even more essential.\n\nWe reject proposed rule 11.10(9),\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e4\u003c/span\u003e which relates to the employment of suspended or disbarred lawyers and which has the effect of overruling this Court's holding in The Florida Bar v. Thomson, 310 So.2d 300 (Fla.1975), granting permission to suspended, disbarred, resigned, or inactive lawyers to be employed by a law firm or professional association to perform services which ethically could be performed by other lay persons. This proposal has been before the Court on several occasions since the Thomson case was decided, and limitations upon such employment have been imposed. See Fla.Bar Integr.Rule, art. XI, rule 11.10(7). No additional information has been supplied to the Court in connection with this proposal which would justify further reconsideration of such a thoroughly considered matter.\n\nProposed rule 11.12(6)(a), (b), and (c)\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e5\u003c/span\u003e is likewise rejected as unnecessary. Subsections (a) and (b) give absolute immunity to the complainants and to the disciplinary agents. We deem that participants in a disciplinary proceeding have the same privileges that a person has in a judicial proceeding and that creation of a new status which departs from a well-established body of law is inadvisable. Subsection (c) deals with the granting of immunity from prosecution. This subject is dealt with by our decision in Ciravolo v. The Florida Bar, 361 So.2d 121 (Fla.1978). Further amplification of that decision by rule does not appear to be necessary or advisable.\n\nProposed rule 11.13(1)\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e6\u003c/span\u003e establishes a speedy trial rule in disciplinary proceedings. We find that such a speedy trial rule is not necessary at this time since the revisions to article XI, which we approve, are expected to expedite disciplinary matters. Furthermore, it is not clear that application of the speedy trial concept embodied in the Florida Rules of Criminal Procedure to disciplinary proceedings is in the best public interest.\n\nWe reject the special committee's suggestion that rule 11.14, relating to disciplinary proceedings in circuit courts, be eliminated in its entirety. This rule provides a means to discipline attorneys exclusively within the judicial process, totally removed from the organized bar, and should remain in effect.\n\nFinally, we reject in its entirety proposed rule 11.14,\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e7\u003c/span\u003e which establishes procedures for conducting qualification proceedings against an attorney incapable of practicing law generally or in a particular area of law because of lack of expertise or qualifications or inability to render legal services in a prompt and competent manner. We find present rule 11.01(4) to be adequate for these purposes, particularly in view of the fact that no instances of deficiencies in operating under the existing rule have been brought to our attention.\n\nHaving rejected, in their totality, the foregoing proposed changes, we now proceed to those proposed rules which we approve but with some modification.\n\nThe suggested amendment to rule 11.03(2), which we modify slightly, eliminates the requirement that a lawyer member of the grievance committee must have been a member of The Florida Bar for not less than five years and provides for lay participation on the grievance committees. The Committee for Lawyer Disciplinary Procedures suggests, and we agree, that non-lawyer participation in the disciplinary process is desirable and that this participation should be at the grievance committee level where probable cause is determined. We disagree, however, with the deletion of the requirement from the present rule that each lawyer member of the committees shall have been a member of The Florida Bar for not less than five years. Such experience and maturity in the profession is deemed beneficial to the process. Rule 11.03(2)(c) is modified to read as follows:\n\n(c) MEMBERSHIP, APPOINTMENT AND ELIGIBILITY. Each grievance committee shall be appointed by the Board of Governors and shall consist of not less than three members. Of The Florida Bar, each of whom shall have been a member of The Florida Bar for not less than five years. At least one-third of the committee members shall be non-lawyers. All appointees shall be of legal age and shall be residents of the circuit or have their principal office in the circuit. The lawyer members of the committee shall have been members of The Florida Bar for not less than five years.\n\nWith the advent of lay participation in grievance committees, The Florida Bar suggests a modification to rule 11.03(2)(h), concerning quorum vote, which we approve. The rule as modified is as follows:\n\n(h) QUORUM, VOTE. Not less than three members, one of whom must be the chairman or vice-chairman and another of whom must be a lawyer, shall constitute a quorum. All findings of probable cause and Recommendations of guilt of minor misconduct shall be made by affirmative vote of a majority of the committee Members present, which majority must number at least two members. The number of committee members voting for or against the committee report shall be reflected in the report. Minority reports may be filed.\n\nThe proposed revision of rule 11.03(3)\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e8\u003c/span\u003e contemplates the use of circuit judges as referees, but additionally provides that members of The Florida Bar with extensive trial experience may be appointed as referees. We find that the use of trial judges, including county judges, as referees will be beneficial to the disciplinary process in that it will provide more uniformity in procedure and reduction in time involved in the trial of cases. In view of the number of trial judges available for service as referees, we conclude that it is unnecessary and complicating to use non-judicial referees. Accordingly, we modify the proposed amendment to eliminate the language relating to the continuing use of non-judicial members of The Florida Bar as referees. We also delete the proposed requirement that the referee shall reside in a different circuit than the respondent. Rule 11.03(3) is amended to read as follows:\n\n(3) REFEREES. The chief justice shall have the power to appoint referees to try disciplinary cases and to delegate to a chief judge of a judicial circuit the power to appoint referees for duty in his respective circuit. Such appointees shall ordinarily be active county or circuit judges, but the chief justice may appoint retired judges.\n\nAfter the special committee filed its report with this Court, The Florida Bar staff counsel suggested a change in proposed rule 11.03(9), dealing with court reporters, to include a time period within which the accused or respondent attorney could object to the use of a court reporter who was a full- or part-time employee of The Florida Bar. Agreeing that the time period is desirable, we modify the proposed amendment and adopt rule 11.03(9) as follows:\n\n(9) COURT REPORTERS. Court reporters who are full- or part-time employees of The Florida Bar may be appointed to report any disciplinary proceeding. If the accused or respondent attorney objects at least 48 hours in advance of the matter to be recorded, an independent contract reporter may be retained. Reasonable costs for court reporter service may be taxed to a respondent or accused for payment to The Florida Bar.\n\nTo assure that all complaints get into the system promptly, other than those matters which are based on minor misunderstanding and which may be resolved by the grievance committee to the satisfaction of the complainant, the special committee suggests amendment of rule 11.04(2)(a).\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e9\u003c/span\u003e For the most part, we agree with the suggested revision of this rule. We do not agree, however, that the grievance committee, having referred a matter to staff counsel for docketing, may not proceed with the matter unless it has been referred back to the committee by staff counsel. The importance of staff counsel's being informed as to matters referred to grievance committees is undisputed, but the grievance committee should not be limited in its investigation if staff counsel does not recommend investigation. With our modification incorporated into the proposed revision, rule 11.04(2)(a) shall read as follows:\n\n(a) INVESTIGATION. A grievance committee is required to consider all charges of misconduct Forwarded to the committee by staff counsel whether based upon a written complaint or not. All written charges of misconduct received by a committee member from a source other than staff counsel shall within 10 days be forwarded to staff counsel for docketing and other appropriate action unless the committee member receiving the complaint satisfies the complainant within the 10-day period that formal investigation of the complaint is not required. Formal investigation by a grievance committee may proceed after the matter has been referred to staff counsel for docketing.\n\nThe special committee's recommended change in rule 11.04(6)(b) states, in part, that the formal complaint shall be signed by a member of the committee who participated in the proceeding. We conclude that this complaint should be signed by the chairman or vice-chairman. Rule 11.04(6)(b), as set out below, is approved:\n\n(b) FINDINGS OF PROBABLE CAUSE. If a grievance committee finds probable cause, The Staff counsel assigned to the committee shall Promptly prepare a record of its investigation and a Report Formal complaint and file the same with the executive director, the Report Proceedings being filed in duplicate. The formal complaint shall be signed by the chairman or vice-chairman of the committee who participated in the proceeding. The record and Report Formal complaint shall be in such form And with such content as shall be prescribed by the Board of Governors. Such record and Report Formal complaint shall be reviewed Promptly by staff counsel. Should staff counsel question the grievance committee's Finding of probable cause Formal complaint, further proceedings shall be suspended and the matter referred to the Board of Governors. Or returned to the grievance committee for further action. Staff counsel may also return a formal complaint to a grievance committee to remedy technical deficiencies in the complaint. When a Finding of probable cause Formal complaint by a grievance committee is not referred to the Board of Governors, or returned to the grievance committee for further action, The executive director Staff counsel shall furnish a copy of the Report Formal complaint to the Accused Respondent, and a copy of the record shall be made available to the Accused Respondent at his expense.\n\nBecause we believe that confidentiality should be retained where private reprimands are concerned, the proposed amendment to rule 11.06(5)(d),\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e10\u003c/span\u003e relating to filing of motions to retain confidential status, is modified to read:\n\n(d) DISPOSITION OF MOTIONS. Hearings upon motions may be deferred until the final hearing; and, whenever heard, rulings thereon may be reserved until termination of the final hearing, but a motion to maintain confidential status for the protection of a client which is filed within 20 days after service of the complaint on the respondent shall be decided before trial and the proceedings shall remain confidential until an order is issued on the motion.\n\nRule 11.09(3)(f) relates to the judgment of the Supreme Court after review of the referee's report. The special committee suggests that the language relating to the authority of this Court to require the parties to file briefs or to require oral argument directed to the suitability of the disciplinary measure when no petition for review of the referee's recommended disciplinary measure had been filed be deleted. We reject this recommended deletion. The proposed amendment to rule 11.09(3)(f) is modified, and the following rule changes are approved:\n\n(f) JUDGMENT OF SUPREME COURT. After review, the Supreme Court shall enter an appropriate order or judgment. If no review is sought of a Judgment or report of a referee entered under the rules and filed in the Court, The findings of fact shall be deemed conclusive and the disciplinary measure recommended by the referee shall be the disciplinary measure imposed by the Court, unless the Court directs the parties to submit briefs or oral argument directed to the suitability of the disciplinary measure recommended by the referee. A referee report which becomes final when no review has been timely filed shall be reported in an order of the Supreme Court.\n\nThe special committee proposes a major revision of rule 11.12(1), which deals with confidentiality. With the modification requiring the maintaining of confidentiality when a private reprimand has been rejected by the accused attorney and with the rejection of the suggested deletion of subsection (b) relating to circuit court proceedings, rule 11.12(1) is amended to read:\n\n(1) PUBLIC RECORD. Those parts of proceedings prior to the trial which are required to be served upon an accused,, and the record of the proceedings as elsewhere defined, shall become public information in the following instances:\n\n(a) REQUEST OF ACCUSED OR RESPONDENT. If the accused or respondent shall file in the proceeding a request in writing that the proceedings be made public information.\n\n(b) CIRCUIT COURT. If the proceeding is in a circuit court; but proceedings in contempt of confidential proceedings shall preserve the confidentiality of the disciplinary proceeding as elsewhere provided.\n\n(c) JUDGMENT OF SUSPENSION OR DISBARRMENT. Upon entry of a judgment of suspension from practice, disbarrment or of public reprimand.\n\n(d) REVIEW BY SUPREME COURT. FILING OF COMPLAINT. Upon the filing of a Petition for review in the manner provided by the rule governing review by the Supreme Court. Formal complaint by staff counsel in the Supreme Court and expiration of the time allowed for the filing of a motion to maintain confidential status as provided in rule 11.06(5)(b). Provided, however, that confidentiality shall be retained in situations where private reprimand is recommended, unless the accused or respondent waives confidentiality as provided by rule 11.12(1)(a). If a motion is filed pursuant to rule 11.06(5) (b), the matter shall remain confidential until the motion is ruled upon and thereafter as provided in the order on the motion or as otherwise provided in these rules.\n\nWith the modifications previously discussed and with other modifications not discussed, The Florida Bar Integration Rule, article XI, is readopted as follows:\n\nARTICLE XI. RULES OF DISCIPLINE\n\nThe exclusive jurisdiction of the Supreme Court over the discipline of persons admitted to the practice of law shall be administered in the following manner subject to the supervision and review of the Court.\n\nRULE 11.01: PRINCIPLES AND DEFINITIONS\n\n(1) NOTICE AND KNOWLEDGE OF RULES. Every member of The Florida Bar and every attorney of another state who is admitted to practice for the purpose of a specific case before a court of record of this state under section 2 of article II of the Integration Rule is within the jurisdiction of this Court and its agencies under this rule and is charged with notice and held to know the provisions of this rule and the standards of ethical and professional conduct prescribed by this Court. Jurisdiction over an attorney of another state who is not a member of The Florida Bar shall be limited to his conduct as an attorney in relation to the business for which he was permitted to practice in this state, and his privilege in the future to practice law in the State of Florida.\n\n(2) PROCESS. Every member of The Florida Bar is charged with notice of the provisions of section 6 of article II, relating to change of mailing address or military status, and that mailing by registered or certified mail of papers or notices prescribed in these rules to the last mailing address of an attorney as shown by the official records in the office of the executive director of The Florida Bar shall be sufficient notice and service unless this Court shall direct otherwise. Every attorney of another state who is permitted to practice for the purpose of a specific case before a court of record of this state may be served by registered or certified mail addressed to said attorney in care of the Florida attorney who was associated or appeared with him in the specific case for which the out-of-state attorney was permitted to practice, or addressed to said attorney at any address listed by him in the pleadings in such case.\n\n(3) DEFINITIONS. Wherever used in these rules the following words or terms shall have the meaning herein set forth unless the use thereof shall clearly indicate a different meaning:\n\n(a) The accused or accused attorney: a member of The Florida Bar Or an attorney subject to these rules under rule 11.01(1) who has been accused of misconduct or whose conduct is under investigation, but as to which conduct there has been no finding of either probable cause or no probable cause.\n\n(b) Bar counsel: a member of The Florida Bar appointed to represent The Florida Bar in any proceeding under these rules.\n\n(c) The Board, or the Board of Governors: the Board of Governors of The Florida Bar.\n\n(d) Complainant or complaining witness: any person who has complained of the conduct of any member of The Florida Bar to any officer or agency of The Florida Bar.\n\n(e) This Court, or the Court: the Supreme Court of the State of Florida.\n\n(f) Court of this state: a state court authorized and established by the constitution or laws of the State of Florida.\n\n(g) Executive committee: The executive committee of the Board of Governors of The Florida Bar.\n\n(h) Executive director: the executive director of The Florida Bar.\n\n(i) Probable cause: a finding by an authorized agency that there is cause to believe that a member of The Florida Bar is guilty of misconduct justifying disciplinary action.\n\n(j) Referee: a Judge or retired judge Member of The Florida Bar appointed to conduct proceedings as provided under these rules.\n\n(k) Respondent: a member of The Florida Bar Or an attorney subject to these rules under rule 11.01(1) against whom there has been a finding of probable cause.\n\n(l) Staff counsel: an employee of The Florida Bar elsewhere authorized. When used in this rule, the term shall include associate or assistant staff counsel.\n\n(4) PLACEMENT ON INACTIVE LIST FOR INCAPACITY NOT RELATED TO MISCONDUCT. Whenever an attorney who has not been adjudged incompetent is incapable of practicing law because of physical or mental illness, incapacity or other infirmity, he may be placed upon an inactive list and shall refrain from the practice of law for such reason even though no misconduct on his part is alleged or proved. Proceedings with a view of placing an attorney on the inactive list under this section shall be processed under article XI in the same manner as proceedings involving acts of misconduct. A member who has been placed on such inactive list may be readmitted upon application to and approval by the Board of Governors. A rejection of such petition may be reviewed by petition to the Supreme Court.\n\nRULE 11.02: BREACHES OF DISCIPLINE\n\nThe following principles, among others expressly adopted by this Court, shall govern the conduct of members of The Florida Bar in their capacity as attorneys and shall govern all proceedings for discipline of such members: a license to practice law confers no vested right to the holder thereof, but is a conditional privilege revocable for cause. The primary purpose of discipline of attorneys is the protection of the public and the administration of justice, as well as protection of the legal profession through the discipline of members of the Bar. It is the responsibility of this Court to purge the Bar of those unworthy to practice law in this state, and it is the obligation of The Florida Bar and the individual members thereof to give unlimited cooperation and assistance to this Court in the discharge of this responsibility. The Florida Bar is expressly delegated the authority, power, and duty to maintain high ethical standards and to take such proceedings as authorized in these rules to ensure such standards in the Bar of Florida.\n\n(1) OATH. Violation of the oath taken by an attorney to support the Constitutions of the United States and the State of Florida is ground for disciplinary action. Membership in, alliance with, or support of the Communist Party or any organization, group, or party advocating or dedicated to the overthrow of the government by violence or by any means in violation of the Constitution of the United States or constitution of this state shall be a violation of the oath.\n\n(2) CODE OF ETHICS. Violation of the Code of Professional Responsibility as adopted by article X of the Integration Rule is a cause for discipline.\n\n(3) MORAL CONDUCT.\n\n(a) STANDARDS. The standards of professional conduct to be observed by members of the Bar are not limited to the observance of rules and avoidance of prohibitive acts, and the enumeration herein of certain categories of misconduct as constituting grounds for discipline shall not be deemed to be all-inclusive nor shall the failure to specify any particular act of misconduct be construed as tolerance thereof. The commission by a lawyer of any act contrary to honesty, justice, or good morals, whether the act is committed in the course of his relations as an attorney or otherwise, whether committed within or outside the State of Florida, and whether or not the act is a felony or misdemeanor, constitutes a cause for discipline.\n\n(b) CRIME. If the alleged misconduct constitutes a felony or misdemeanor, The Florida Bar may initiate disciplinary action whether or not the accused attorney has been tried, acquitted, or convicted in a court for the alleged criminal offense; however, the Board of Governors may, in its discretion, withhold prosecution of disciplinary proceedings pending the outcome of criminal proceedings against an accused attorney. If the Board believes that prosecution thereof might tend to prejudice the accused attorney in his defense or the state in the presentation of the criminal proceedings.\n\n(4) TRUST FUNDS AND FEES. Money or other property entrusted to an attorney for a specific purpose, including advances for costs and expenses, is held in trust and must be applied only to that purpose. Money and other property of clients coming into the hands of an attorney are not subject to counterclaim or setoff for attorney fees, and refusal to account for and deliver over such property and money upon demand shall be deemed a conversion. This is not to preclude the retention of money or other property upon which the lawyer has a valid lien for services or to preclude the payment of agreed fees from the proceeds of transactions or collections. Controversies as to the amount of fees are not grounds for disciplinary proceedings unless the amount demanded is clearly excessive, extortionate, or the demand is fraudulent.\n\nIn a controversy alleging a clearly excessive, extortionate, or fraudulent fee, announced willingness of an attorney to submit a dispute as to the amount of a fee to a competent tribunal for determination may be considered in any determination as to intent or in mitigation of discipline; provided such willingness shall not preclude admission of any other relevant admissible evidence relating to such controversy, including evidence as to the withholding of funds or property of the client, or to other injury to the client occasioned by such controversy.\n\n(a) TRUST ACCOUNTS REQUIRED. Any bank or savings and loan association account maintained by a member of The Florida Bar to comply with disciplinary rule 9-102 of the Code of Professional Responsibility is and shall be clearly labeled and designated as a trust account. Any safe deposit box used in connection with the practice of law in Florida, maintained by a member of The Florida Bar to comply with said disciplinary rule 9-102, shall be located in this state (unless the client otherwise consents in writing), and the member of The Florida Bar shall advise any institution in which such deposit box is located that the contents of the same may include property of clients.\n\n(b) TRUST ACCOUNTS AS OFFICIAL RECORDS. A member of The Florida Bar shall preserve or cause to be preserved the records of all bank and savings and loan association accounts or other records pertaining to the funds or property of a client maintained by him in compliance with disciplinary rule 9-102 for a period of not less than six years subsequent to the last transaction pertaining to the same or subsequent to the final conclusion of the representation of a client relative to such funds or property, whichever shall last occur. Such records shall include checkbooks, cancelled checks, check stubs, vouchers, ledgers and journals, closing statements, accountings or other statements of disbursements rendered to clients or other parties with regard to trust funds, or similar equivalent records clearly and expressly reflecting the date, amount, source, and reason for all receipts, withdrawals, deliveries, and disbursements of the funds or property of a client. All of such records shall be deemed to be kept pursuant to the Integration Rule of The Florida Bar, as a specific prerequisite to the right to receive, deliver, and disburse funds or property of a client, and to have a public aspect relating to the protection of clients and to fitness of a member of The Florida Bar to practice law. In any instance of an alleged violation by a member of The Florida Bar of this rule 11.02(4) or of any disciplinary rule of the Code of Professional Responsibility, such records insofar as they may relate in any way to the transaction, occurrence, or client in question shall be produced by the member of The Florida Bar for inspection, audit, and copying by a designated representative of The Florida Bar upon the direction of this Court or any judge of this state acting under rule 11.14 or of a grievance committee or of the Board of Governors if acting pursuant to rule 11.05(2) or of a referee. Such records or copies thereof shall be admissible in evidence in any proceedings under this rule; provided notice of such intended use shall be given to any client involved, if practicable, unless such client is already aware of such intended use, and upon good cause shown by such client the admission of the same shall be under such conditions as shall be reasonably calculated thereafter to protect the confidences of such client in the event that the proceedings otherwise become public records pursuant to rule 11.12. Permissible means of protection shall not prejudice the respondent or accused attorney and may include but are not limited to excision, in camera production, retention in sealed envelopes, or similar devices. Failure to maintain such records or to produce them upon such direction shall constitute grounds for disciplinary action under the Integration Rule without regard to any other matter. The cost of any audit or investigation necessitated by such failure may be taxed against a respondent.\n\n(c) TRUST ACCOUNTING PROCEDURES. The Florida Bar shall promulgate by-laws under this rule, such by-laws and amendments thereto to be approved by this Court, prescribing minimum trust accounting records which shall be maintained and minimum trust accounting procedures which must be followed by all attorneys practicing in Florida who receive or disburse trust money or property. The minimum procedure shall require reconciliation of trust account balances at periodic intervals and the annual filing of a certificate reflecting compliance with minimum record keeping and procedural requirements. Failure to file the required certificate, the filing of a trust savings account certificate showing noncompliance with the by-laws, or the return of a trust account check for insufficient funds shall be good cause for The Florida Bar to order an audit of the trust account at the cost of the attorney audited. Other audits for cause conducted by The Florida Bar shall be at the cost of the attorney audited unless the audit reveals that the attorney was without fault and that his trust account records and procedures are in substantial compliance with the minimum requirements.\n\n(d) TRUST SAVINGS ACCOUNTS. A member of The Florida Bar who elects to create or maintain a trust savings account shall comply with the following provisions:\n\n(i) A trust savings account may be established with any bank or savings and loan association authorized by federal or state law to do business in Florida and insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation.\n\n(ii) Except as otherwise required by law, funds in each trust savings account shall be subject to withdrawal, or to transfer to a trust checking account, upon request and without delay. Any depository institution permitted by law to require advance notification (30 or 60 days) before allowing withdrawal of savings deposits is nonetheless eligible to act as a depository for trust savings accounts under this rule if it meets the requirements of paragraph (i) above, provided the institution has not acted to delay the withdrawal of deposited funds (other than for the clearance of deposited funds or for good cause attributable to the circumstances of the particular depositor rather than the institution's financial needs or general policy) at any time during the past five years. An otherwise qualified institution which has not been in existence for five full years may serve as a trust savings account depository if it has met the requirements of this subsection throughout its existence.\n\n(iii) An institution shall cease to be eligible for the receipt of trust savings funds at such time as it fails to qualify under paragraphs (i) or (ii). Any lawyer or law firm maintaining a trust savings account against which immediate withdrawal rights are refused shall immediately notify The Florida Bar Foundation, Inc. of the name and address of the depository institution and the date of such refusal.\n\n(iv) If, pursuant to governing law or banking regulations, a depository institution requires notice in writing for an intended withdrawal not less than 30 days before such withdrawal is made, the lawyer or law firm may certify to The Florida Bar Foundation, Inc. that the client's funds detained as a result of the depository institution's notification requirement are needed immediately for the client's affairs.\n\n(A) Upon receiving such certification, the Foundation shall be authorized to advance to the certifying lawyer or law firm, from the interest earned on trust savings accounts, an amount of money necessary to meet the client's emergency needs subject, however, to limitations expressed in subparagraph (C).\n\n(B) Simultaneously with certification, the lawyer or law firm shall direct the depository institution in writing, with a copy to the Foundation, that upon the expiration of the notification period detained funds equal to the amount advanced by the Foundation shall be remitted directly to the Foundation.\n\n(C) The Board of Directors of the Foundation may adopt rules of procedure reasonably necessary to implement the authority provided in subparagraph (A) and to assure full reimbursement of sums advanced. Periodically the Board may set dollar limitations on the amount of money which may be advanced to meet the emergency needs of any client in the event a notification requirement is imposed by a depository institution.\n\n(v) The rate of interest payable on any trust savings account shall not be less than the rate paid by the depository institution to regular, non-attorney savings depositors. Higher rates offered by the institution to customers whose deposits exceed certain time or quantity minima, such as those offered in the form of certificates of deposit, may be obtained by a lawyer or law firm so long as there is no impairment of the right to withdraw or transfer principal immediately (except as accounts generally may be subject to statutory notification requirements), even though interest may be sacrificed thereby.\n\n(vi) Lawyers or law firms electing to deposit client funds in a trust savings account shall direct the depository institution:\n\n(A) to remit interest or dividends, as the case may be, on the average monthly balance in the account, at least quarterly, to The Florida Bar Foundation, Inc.;\n\n(B) to transmit with each remittance to the Foundation a statement showing the name of the lawyer or law firm for whom the remittance is sent and the rate of interest applied; and\n\n(C) to transmit to the depositing lawyer or law firm at the same time a report showing the amount paid to the Foundation, the rate of interest applied, the average account balance for each month of the period for which the report is made, and any remittances to the Foundation made during that period pursuant to subparagraph (iv)(B).\n\n(vii) Lawyers and law firms electing to deposit client funds in a trust savings account shall transmit to each client for whom trust funds are now held, and to each new client for whom funds are to be held, a copy of the notice reproduced below. The Florida Bar shall print and maintain a supply of this notice, and distribute copies without charge to those who may request them. The Bar's costs for printing and distribution shall be treated as a cost of administering the program, and shall be reimbursed to the Bar by the Foundation from interest earned on trust accounts.\n\nIMPORTANT NOTICE TO CLIENTS\n\nFor your protection, the Florida Supreme Court requires that all funds of a client which are held by an attorney must be deposited in a trust account separate from the attorney's, and must be kept available for immediate withdrawal. Because most clients' funds which come into the hands of attorneys are relatively small in amount or are to be held for relatively short periods of time, it is impractical for attorneys to establish a separate account for each client or to invest each client's funds to earn interest. For this reason client funds are held in a common trust checking account on which the depository bank pays no interest.\n\nUnder a new program approved by the Florida Supreme Court, attorneys are now permitted to deposit clients' common trust funds in savings accounts. Due to the expense and complexity which would attend any attempt to compute or distribute the interest attributable to each client's funds, it is not feasible to pay to individual clients the earnings on their proportionate share of common trust savings accounts. Of course, no attorney is permitted to receive the earnings on a client's funds, either. Rather, under the Supreme Court's new directive, the interest income from clients' deposits will be used to fund programs designed to benefit the general public.\n\nThe goals of the Court's program are to improve the administration of justice in this state and to expand the delivery of legal services to the poor.\n\nWe have sent you this explanation, at the direction of the Florida Supreme Court, to advise you that we are participating in the court's new program and that the funds you have entrusted to us for your affairs (other than attorneys' fees) will be deposited in an interest-bearing trust savings account unless you specifically give us written instructions to the contrary. A directive not to allow such use of your funds will not produce income for you. Your funds will simply be placed in a non-interest-bearing trust checking account until needed.\n\n(e) UNIDENTIFIABLE TRUST FUND ACCUMULATIONS AND TRUST FUNDS HELD FOR MISSING OWNERS. When an attorney's trust account contains an unidentifiable accumulation of trust funds or property, or trust funds or property held for missing owners, such funds or property shall be so designated. Diligent search and inquiry shall then be made by the attorney to determine the beneficial owner of any unidentifiable accumulation or the address of any missing owner. If the beneficial owner of an unidentified accumulation is determined, the funds shall be properly identified as his trust property. If a missing beneficial owner is located, the trust funds or property shall be paid over or delivered to the beneficial owner if he is then entitled to receive the same. Trust funds and property which remain unidentifiable and funds or property which are held for missing owners after being designated as such may, after diligent search and inquiry fails to identify the beneficial owner or owner's address, be reported to The Florida Bar with a request that The Florida Bar accept such money or property and hold the same in trust for the missing or unidentified owners and for ultimate disposition as provided in chapter 717, Florida Statutes. If The Florida Bar declines to accept the subject money or property then within one year after the money or property is designated as an unidentified accumulation or being held for missing owners the attorney shall petition the circuit court for declaration of abandoned property as provided in section 717.131, Florida Statutes, and serve a copy of the petition on The Florida Bar.\n\n(5) SOLICITATION. The solicitation of professional employment by advertisement, runners, solicitors, investigators, or in any other manner Except as authorized by controlling court decision, the Integration Rule, or the Code of Professional Responsibility shall constitute grounds for disciplinary action. Payment of compensation shall not be a necessary element of proof of solicitation.\n\n(6) DISCIPLINE BY FOREIGN JURISDICTION. A final adjudication by a court or other authorized disciplinary agency of another jurisdiction, state or federal, in a disciplinary proceeding that an attorney licensed to practice in that jurisdiction is guilty of misconduct justifying disciplinary action shall be considered as conclusive proof of such misconduct in a disciplinary proceeding under this rule. In such cases, the adjudication of misconduct shall be sufficient basis for the filing of a complaint by The Florida Bar and assignment for hearing before a referee without a finding of probable cause under these rules.\n\nA member of The Florida Bar disbarred or suspended from the practice of law by a court or other authorized disciplinary agency of another state or by a federal court shall within 30 days after the effective date of disbarrment or suspension file with this Court a copy of the order or judgment effecting such disbarrment or suspension.\n\nRULE 11.03: DISCIPLINARY AGENCIES\n\nThe jurisdiction of the Supreme Court shall be administered in the manner hereinafter stated.

Notwithstanding the rules of confidentiality elsewhere stated in the Integration Rule, confidentiality of disciplinary proceedings shall be waived commencing with the filing of the formal complaint contemplated by Rule 11.05 after the probable cause finding by a grievance committee or the Board of Governors as therein set forth, in cases involving:\n\n(a) A felony or other serious crime, or\n\n(b) Conduct by an accused which constitutes a general unfitness to practice law, or\n\n(c) Where the public interest clearly demands and the constitutional guaranties of the accused will not be thereby violated or denied, provided, however, that, prior to any waiver of confidentiality, the accused shall have 15 days to petition the full Board of Governors to maintain confidentiality for good cause shown, after notice of probable cause is served on him by certified mail with return receipt personally signed by the accused or by other means of personal service. Such letter of service shall advise that confidentiality shall be waived under the Rule unless such petition to the Board is timely filed and favorably considered. Upon such petition being filed, confidentiality shall be maintained until disposition of such petition. Once waiver is effected it will include the formal complaint and all subsequent proceedings thereon unless it is thereafter determined for good cause by the Board to reinvoke confidentiality.\n\nRULE 11.13: ADDITIONAL RULES OF PROCEDURE\n\n(1) TIME IS DIRECTORY. Except as Otherwise provided In Herein These Rules of Discipline, the time intervals required are directory only and are not jurisdictional. Failure to observe such directory intervals may result in contempt of the agency having jurisdiction or of the Supreme Court, but will not prejudice the offending party except where so provided.\n\n(2) NOTICE IN LIEU OF PROCESS. Every member of The Florida Bar is within the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court and its agencies under these rules, and service of process is not required to obtain jurisdiction over respondents in disciplinary proceedings; but due process requires the giving of reasonable notice and such shall be effected by the service of the complaint upon the respondent by mailing a copy thereof by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, to the last known address of the respondent according to the records of The Florida Bar or such later address as may be known to the person effecting the service.\n\n(3) SUBPOENAS. Subpoenas for the attendance of witnesses and the production of documentary evidence other than before a circuit court shall be issued as follows:\n\n(a) REFEREES.

Subpoenas for the attendance of witnesses and the production of documentary evidence before the Board of Governors shall be issued by the executive director under the seal of The Florida Bar and shall be served in the manner provided by law for the service of process.\n\n(e) (d) CONFIDENTIAL PROCEEDINGS. If the proceeding is confidential, a subpoena shall not name the accused or respondent but shall style the proceeding as \"Confidential proceeding by The Florida Bar under the Rules of Discipline.\"\n\n(f) (e) CONTEMPT. Any person who, without adequate excuse, fails to obey such a subpoena served upon him may be cited for contempt of this Court in the manner provided by this rule.\n\n(4) OATH OF WITNESSES. Every witness in every proceeding under these rules shall be sworn to tell the truth and not to disclose the existence of the proceeding nor the identity of the accused or respondent until the proceeding is no longer confidential under these rules. Violation of the oath shall be an act of contempt of this Court.\n\n(5) CONTEMPT. If an agency other than a circuit court shall find that a person is in contempt under these rules, such person shall be cited for contempt in the following manner, except that an accused or respondent in a disciplinary proceeding may be cited for contempt by petition for Rule And order to show cause filed and heard in the Supreme Court or in the circuit court:\n\n(a) PETITION FOR RULE ORDER TO SHOW CAUSE. The agency shall direct bar counsel or chairman of the agency, if there is no bar counsel serving in the matter in which the contempt occurs, to present to the circuit court having jurisdiction a petition for the issuance of A rule An order to show cause why the person so accused should not be held in contempt of this Court.\n\n(b) CONFIDENTIALITY. If the proceeding in which the contempt occurs is a confidential proceeding, the confidentiality shall be preserved in the contempt proceeding in the following manner: pleading shall be styled \"Proceeding by The Florida Bar under the Rules of Discipline, The Florida Bar v. (name of accused in contempt proceeding).\" No pleadings or matters shall be filed with the clerk of the circuit court; instead all such matters shall be presented to the circuit judge hearing the same and shall be returned to the agency upon completion of the contempt proceedings and then filed with the Executive director Record in the disciplinary case. Docket entries and sentences or judgments in contempt proceedings, if entered in the office of the clerk of the circuit court, shall be styled as provided for pleadings and shall make no references to the accused or the respondent in the disciplinary proceedings in which the contempt occurred. If the name of the accused or respondent shall become of public record, the court having jurisdiction in the contempt proceeding shall take appropriate steps to preserve the confidentiality of the disciplinary proceedings and shall consider whether or not the person responsible for the making of the name of the accused or respondent of public record is also guilty of contempt under these Rules of Discipline.\n\n(c) APPELLATE REVIEW. A judgment in such contempt proceedings may be appealed by either party in the manner provided in the rule on appellate review, except that a copy of the petition for Appeal Review shall not be filed with the clerk of the circuit court, and the record shall be forwarded by the judge or the agency possessing the same.\n\n(6) CONSENT JUDGMENT.\n\n(a) BEFORE REFEREE AND BAR COUNSEL ARE APPOINTED FORMAL COMPLAINT IS FILED. If before a Referee and bar counsel are appointed Formal complaint is filed, An accused attorney A respondent states his or her desire to plead guilty to a grievance committee report that finds probable cause and recommends further disciplinary proceedings, then staff counsel (or assistant staff counsel), with the approval of the designated Board reviewer, may advise the Accused attorney Respondent of the discipline he Or she will receive if a written plea of guilty is entered. No recommended discipline will be conveyed to the Accused attorney Respondent unless staff counsel and a designated reviewer are in complete agreement and their agreement is reduced to writing and made part of the file. If An accused attorney A respondent tenders a plea of guilty in exchange for a stated form of punishment and staff counsel and the designated reviewer cannot agree on acceptance or rejection of the conditional guilty plea, then the tendered plea will be referred to the Board of Governors for a final decision. Any proposed consent judgment more severe than a private reprimand shall before acceptance by The Florida Bar be submitted by The Florida Bar to the Supreme Court for approval.\n\n(b) AFTER APPOINTMENT OF REFEREE AND BAR COUNSEL FILING OF FORMAL COMPLAINT. If An accused attorney A respondent states his or her desire to plead guilty to a Grievance committee report or a filed Formal complaint That has been filed After a referee and bar counsel are appointed, then bar counsel, with the approval of Staff counsel (or assistant staff counsel) and the designated reviewer, The Board of Governors, may advise the accused attorney of the discipline The Bar will recommend to the referee He will receive if a written plea of guilty is entered. No recommended discipline will be conveyed to the accused attorney unless the bar counsel, staff counsel, and the designated reviewer are in complete agreement and that agreement is reduced to writing and made a part of the file. If an accused attorney tenders a plea of guilty in exchange for a stated form of punishment, and bar counsel, staff counsel, and the designated reviewer cannot agree on acceptance or rejection of the conditional guilty plea, then the tendered plea will be referred to the Board of Governors for a final decision. Any proposed consent judgment more severe than a private reprimand shall before acceptance by The Florida Bar be submitted by The Florida Bar to the Supreme Court for approval.\n\n(c) Acceptance of any proposed consent judgment more severe than a private reprimand shall be conditional on final approval by the Supreme Court, and the Court's order will recite the disciplinary charges against the respondent.\n\n(d) All conditional pleas shall show clearly by reference or otherwise the disciplinary offenses to which the plea is made.\n\n(7) NOTICE OF DISCIPLINARY RECORD. Whenever staff counsel furnishes a judicial nominating commission or other independent authority any report of a past disciplinary record or pending investigation concerning a member of The Florida Bar, the subject attorney shall forthwith be advised of the content of such report by staff counsel.\n\n(8) ETHICS OPINIONS. Opinions of the Professional Ethics Committee of The Florida Bar are advisory only.\n\nRULE 11.14: DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS IN CIRCUIT COURTS\n\n(1) DISCIPLINARY MATTERS IN DISTRICT COURTS OF APPEAL AND CIRCUIT COURTS. Whenever it shall be made known to any of the judges of the district courts of appeal or any judge of a circuit court in this state that a member of The Florida Bar practicing in any of the courts of his district or judicial circuit has been guilty of any unprofessional act as defined by this Integration Rule or the Code of Ethics Professional Responsibility adopted by this Court, such judge may direct the state attorney for the circuit in which such attorney shall have his office to make in writing a motion in the name of the State of Florida to discipline such attorney setting forth in the motion the particular act or acts of conduct for which the attorney is sought to be disciplined.\n\n(2) COPY SERVED UPON ACCUSED. Upon the filing of such motion a copy thereof shall be served upon the accused attorney, and he shall, within 10 days after the service thereof, file his answer thereto. A copy of such motion shall be filed with the executive director of The Florida Bar at the time of service upon the accused attorney.\n\n(3) TRIAL BEFORE A CIRCUIT JUDGE. Upon the filing of the answer, the Presiding Chief judge of the judicial circuit in which the accused attorney's office is located shall designate one of the judges thereof to try to determine said cause. Such judge shall conduct a hearing thereon and shall hear the evidence to be offered by the State of Florida and the accused. A representative or representatives of The Florida Bar, appointed by the Board of Governors of The Florida Bar, shall have the right to be present and to observe the proceedings. Upon the conclusion of said hearing, said judge shall enter such judgment of dismissal, reprimand, probation, suspension, or disbarrment as shall be appropriate to the circumstances.\n\nThe parties shall be entitled to compulsory process to force the attendance of any witnesses.\n\n(4) JUDGMENT FILED IN SUPREME COURT. If the judgment be one of public reprimand, Probation, suspension, or disbarrment, three certified copies of the same shall be forthwith filed by the clerk of the trial court with the clerk of the Supreme Court of Florida. The clerk of the Supreme Court shall retain one copy for his records, deliver to the executive director of The Florida Bar one copy of said judgment for his official records, and shall forthwith serve the third copy upon the Accused attorney Respondent.\n\n(5) PETITION FOR APPELLATE REVIEW. The respondent may appeal from a judgment entered by a circuit court. Such appeal shall be made in the manner provided by the rule on appellate review.\n\n(6) DUTY TO EXPEDITE PROCEEDINGS. It shall be the duty of the state attorney who is directed to file said motion to file the same promptly and to dispose of said controversy expeditiously.\n\n(7) CONCURRENT JURISDICTION OF THE FLORIDA BAR. The jurisdiction of the district courts of appeal and circuit courts created by this rule and the procedure herein outlined shall be concurrent with that of The Florida Bar under the preceding portions of these Rules of Discipline. The forum first asserting jurisdiction in a disciplinary matter shall retain the same to the exclusion of the other until the final determination of the cause.\n\n(8) READMISSION OR REINSTATEMENT. Readmission or reinstatement of attorneys disbarred or suspended by proceedings in circuit courts shall be governed as elsewhere provided in these rules.\n\nRULE 11.15: STATUTES SUPERSEDED\n\nThese Rules of Discipline shall supersede such parts of sections 454.18, 454.31 and 454.32, Florida Statutes 1969 (1977), as are in conflict herewith.\n\nOver the years, there have been many piecemeal revisions of these disciplinary rules. These modifications have been made by different committees whose members have possessed varying writing styles. There has never been a comprehensive editing of these rules. Such an editing is necessary because of the lack of uniformity in the language used throughout the rules, because of poor grammatical construction in certain instances, and because of the use of some archaic language. In view of the massive changes now made in these rules, this is an appropriate occasion to require such an editing by The Florida Bar. Since there is a need for a substantial editing of these rules, we hereby direct the bar to undertake the task of editing these rules and, thereafter, to report back to this Court. This task does not entail the change in substance of any of these rules but merely requires that correct grammatical structure be inserted, archaic language be eliminated, and uniform terminology be utilized.\n\nFurthermore, consistent with our revisions to article XI and consistent with the Florida Mental Health Act, Florida Bar Integration Rule, article II, section 5, is amended to read:\n\n5. A lawyer who has been adjudged insane or mentally incompetent Or hospitalized under the Florida Mental Health Act shall be suspended from the practice of law. If an order of restoration is entered by a court having jurisdiction or the lawyer is discharged from hospitalization under the Florida Mental Health Act, he may apply to the Board of Governors for reinstatement on the roll of attorneys.\n\n(a) Whenever an attorney is suspended, disbarred, placed on the inactive list, Abandons his practice, disappears, or dies, and no partner, executor, or other responsible party capable of conducting the attorney's affairs is known to exist, the appropriate circuit court, upon proper proof of the fact, may appoint an attorney or attorneys to inventory the files of the subject attorney and to take such action as seems indicated to protect the interests of clients of the subject attorney, as well as the interest of that attorney.\n\n(b) Any attorney so appointed shall not be permitted to disclose any information contained in files so inventoried without the consent of the client to whom such file relates except as necessary to carry out the order of the court which appointed the attorney to make such inventory.\n\nThese rules shall be effective and shall apply to all grievance matters commenced on or after July 1, 1979. All cases not referred to a referee before July 1, 1979, shall be tried in accordance with these rules. All grievance committees shall be re-constituted to conform to these rules as of July 1, 1979.\n\nADKINS, SUNDBERG and HATCHETT, JJ., concur.\n\nENGLAND, C. J., concurs in part and dissents in part with an opinion.\n\nBOYD, J., concurs in part and dissents in part with an opinion.\n\nOVERTON, J., concurs in part and dissents in part with an opinion.\n\nALDERMAN, J., concurs in part and dissents in part with an opinion.\n\nENGLAND, Chief Justice, concurring in part and dissenting in part.\n\nI concur with the adoption of the rules proposed with two exceptions. As would Justice Overton, I would adopt proposed rules 11.04(3) and 11.13(1) to expedite disciplinary proceedings before the grievance committees.\n\nBOYD, Justice, concurring in part and dissenting in part.\n\nI concur with the majority opinion adopting most of the Karl Committee's recommendations and promulgating the amendments to articles II and XI of the Integration Rule. However, I dissent from the majority's rejection of two of the proposals.\n\nI find merit in the committee's proposed rule 11.02(4)(e) pertaining to random audits of lawyers' trust accounts, which the majority opinion rejects. The committee's notes and comments on the proposed changes say the following about this proposed rule: \"The provision of in-house auditors and authority for spot audits is expected to substantially improve the degree of compliance with trust accounting procedures and reduce trust fund defalcations. These auditors are subject to the confidentiality rule.\"\n\nI recognize that random audits, conducted without any showing of cause for inquiry, may in principle be highly offensive to many lawyers. This bitter pill, however, may be just what we need to deter unethical conduct with regard to clients' funds. I am convinced from my years of experience participating in this Court's exercise of its exclusive jurisdiction over the discipline of lawyers, that such unethical conduct starts out small, and then grows.*fn* That is, a lawyer may first \"borrow\" from his trust account to deal with a minor cash-flow emergency, not intending to deprive the client of his property. But such a pattern of conduct can and frequently does ultimately harm clients. Random audits can help lawyers resist the temptation and can terminate such a pattern of conduct when it is still in the small-scale, \"borrowing\" stage.\n\nAs proposed by the committee, however, the rule lacks necessary safeguards. There must be safeguards to prevent the revelation of matters pertaining to clients' affairs and all matters within the scope of the lawyer-client relationship. Although proposed rule 11.02(4)(e)(iii) provides that \"audit reports shall be forwarded to staff counsel on a confidential basis,\" I believe that there is a need for an explicit statement that auditors employed by The Florida Bar who violate confidentiality may be found to be in contempt of this Court.\n\nA further condition that should accompany the promulgation of a rule authorizing random audits is that such authority should only operate prospectively. That is, such audits should pertain only to trust funds received or disbursed, and transactions effected, subsequent to the effective date of a new rule providing for same. Authority for random audits should not apply to the lawyers' records of trust funds that have been disbursed to clients or paid to their nominees prior to the effective date of the rule. Such a qualification would prevent unnecessary expenditure of time and labor and interference in the internal affairs of law offices. Authority for random audits, not based on any probable cause for inquiry, would be a drastic change in the Integration Rule. Confining its scope to trust account transactions arising subsequent to the effective date of the rule, after which all lawyers would be on notice of their liability to audit, would seem to be required by fundamental fairness. Despite these reservations, I dissent from the total rejection of random audits.\n\nProposed rule 11.13(1) provides time standards to effect speedy determinations of probable cause and speedy trials. The proposed rule would require grievance committees to make findings of probable cause within ninety days, with the time period running from thirty days after receipt of written charges or from the date of the first grievance committee meeting following the receipt of charges. The rule would further require that trial be commenced within ninety days of the day after the date of the filing of the formal complaint. Extensions of these time periods in exceptional circumstances are provided for. Much of the difficulty we are experiencing under the present system of discipline stems from the unreasonable delays that have occurred in many cases prior to their reaching this Court. The proposed rule is well adapted to the alleviation of this problem. I dissent from the rejection of proposed rule 11.13(1).\n\nWith the foregoing exceptions, I concur with the majority opinion.\n\nOVERTON, Justice, concurring in part, dissenting in part.\n\nI concur with the adoption of the new proposed rules but dissent from that portion of the opinion which rejects and modifies certain proposed rules which would substantially benefit the disciplinary process. Although I dissent from the rejection of these proposals, I agree that our disciplinary process, as modified by these new rules, will be one of the best and most innovative in the nation.\n\nUnearned Attorney's Fees and Random Audits\n\nI dissent from the rejection of proposed Rule 11.02(4)(d) concerning unearned attorney's fees and Rule 11.02(4)(e) pertaining to random audits. I disagree with the majority opinion that unearned attorney's fees are adequately covered by the present rules and believe that the proposed rule is an improvement. I recognize we have recently adopted a new trust accounting rule, but I would still modify it further to allow random audits as proposed by the special committee.\n\nProbable Cause and Speedy Trial\n\nI also dissent from the majority's failure to adopt proposed Rule 11.04(3) concerning the nature of the probable cause hearing and proposed Rule 11.13(1) which provides for a speedy trial rule. The special disciplinary committee headed by former Justice Karl was created principally because our disciplinary procedures had to be \"more expeditious and responsive to the needs of this day and time.\" That need was also recognized by then president of The Florida Bar, Edward J. Atkins.\u003cspan class=\"fnref\"\u003e1\u003c/span\u003e The two rejected proposed rules were drafted to assist in expediting the disciplinary process, and I believe they should be adopted as proposed.\n\nImmunity from Bar Discipline\n\nI dissent from the total rejection of proposed Rule 11.12(6)(c) which implements in a more effective manner our decision in Ciravolo v. The Florida Bar, 361 So.2d 121 (Fla.1978). I believe that for the aid of the state attorneys of this state, a specific procedure should be placed in the disciplinary rules for obtaining immunity from bar discipline. To avoid judge shopping and the involvement of the entire Supreme Court, I believe the granting of immunity should be authorized only by the Chief Justice or a Justice designated by him. Whether we provide the means to grant this immunity through the entire court or through the Chief Justice alone, better administration would result from placing the procedure within our disciplinary rules and not leave it to this Court's decision in Ciravolo v. The Florida Bar to establish that procedure.\n\nAlthough I have dissented from the rejection and modification of certain of the proposed rules for the reasons expressed, I believe the rules which we have adopted will substantially improve our disciplinary procedure.\n\nALDERMAN, Justice, concurring in part, dissenting in part.\n\nFor the most part, I agree with the majority opinion. I would approve, however, proposed rule 11.02(4)(d), which relates to unearned fees. In my opinion, an attorney should not be able to use a fee received from his client until the fee is earned. The proposed rule clearly excepts from an unearned fee the historic common law retainer fee paid solely to secure availability of the services of a lawyer. It protects the client not only from the dishonest lawyer who might use the fee with no intention of performing the work but also from the lawyer who used the fee while fully intending to perform the work but, because of his death or some other unforeseen event, is unable to do so.\n\nI would approve proposed rule 11.02(4)(e), which deals with spot audits and provides for in-house auditors. I believe that this rule would substantially improve the degree of compliance with trust accounting procedures and would reduce trust fund defalcations. Furthermore, I find that the recent decision of the Supreme Court of the United States in Marshall v. Barlow's, Inc., 436 U.S. 307, 98 S. Ct. 1816, 56 L. Ed. 2d 305 (1978), which held that inspection of business premises without a warrant pursuant to section 8(a), Occupational Health and Safety Act, violated the fourth amendment to the United States Constitution, presents a different situation than we have here. In Marshall, the Supreme Court acknowledged that an exception to the search warrant requirement has been recognized for regulated business and stated that a businessman in regulated industry effectively consents to restrictions placed upon him. The audit of lawyers' trust accounts is more analogous to an audit of bank records by a bank examiner.\n\nI would also approve the recommended revision of rule 11.10(9), which revokes the permission granted a suspended, disbarred, resigned, or inactive lawyer to be employed by a law firm or professional association, because I believe that a suspended or disbarred lawyer who continues to work in or hang around a law office is asking for trouble. To permit a disbarred or suspended attorney's employment as a law clerk or investigator with a law firm would be detrimental to the integrity and reputation of the Bar because it invites public misunderstanding of the disciplinary action taken against the lawyer. Furthermore, it reduces the effect of any order of suspension or disbarrment.\n\nFinally, I would approve the qualifications proceedings proposed by the committee. Proposed rule 11.14 provides procedures for conducting qualification proceedings against an attorney incapable of practicing law, generally or in a particular field of law, because of lack of expertise or qualifications or inability to render legal services in a prompt and competent manner. Remedies which may be imposed on the accused attorney through these proceedings include placement on the inactive list, restrictions upon the right to practice, or subjecting the right to practice to certain conditions such as required supervision, compulsory attendance of CLE courses, passage of designated law school courses, or passage of all or a portion of The Florida Bar examination. This rule would be beneficial to the Bar and to the public.\n\nON REHEARING\n\nPer Curiam.\n\nThe Florida Bar has filed a petition for rehearing requesting (1) that the effective date of the new rules be amended from July 1, 1979, to October 1, 1979; (2) that the three-year service rule limitation imposed upon grievance committee members by Florida Bar Integration Rule, article XI, rule 11.03(2)(d) be waived until October 1, 1979, to permit grievance members presently serving to continue service up to October 1, 1979; (3) that the word \"branch\" be inserted before the words \"staff counsel\" in the second line of new rule 11.04(6)(b) to make it clear that the Court is creating a two-tier review of all formal complaints within the office of staff counsel, and that the words \"Bar headquarters\" be inserted before \"staff counsel\" in lines 10, 11, 14, and 20 of this rule; (4) that this Court modify the trust account auditing rule proposed by the Special Committee as suggested in Justice Boyd's dissenting opinion and adopt this proposed rule as modified; and (5) that the Court extend until July 20, 1979, the time in which the Board of Governors of The Florida Bar may make an additional request for rehearing.\n\nWe hereby grant The Florida Bar's requests (1), (2), and (3). Accordingly, these rules shall be effective and shall apply to all grievance matters commenced on or after October 1, 1979. All cases not referred to a referee before October 1, 1979, shall be tried in accordance with these rules. All grievance committees shall be re-constituted to conform to these rules as of October 1, 1979. Florida Bar Integration Rule, article XI, rule 11.03(2)(d) of the present rules is waived until October 1, 1979, and grievance committee members presently serving are permitted to continue to serve up to October 1, 1979.\n\nWe hereby deny the Bar's requests (4) and (5).\n\nIt is so ordered.\n\nENGLAND, C. J., and ADKINS, BOYD, OVERTON, SUNDBERG, HATCHETT and ALDERMAN, JJ., concur in that part of the decision which grants requests (1), (2), and (3).\n\nENGLAND, C. J., and ADKINS, SUNDBERG and HATCHETT, JJ., concur in that part of the decision which denies request (4).\n\nENGLAND, C. J., and ADKINS, BOYD and OVERTON, JJ., concur in that part of the decision which denies request (5).\n\nSUNDBERG, J., concurs in part and dissents in part with an opinion with which HATCHETT and ALDERMAN, JJ., concur.\n\nALDERMAN, J., concurs in part and dissents in part with an opinion with which BOYD and OVERTON, JJ., concur only as to request (4).\n\nSUNDBERG, Justice, concurring in part and dissenting in part.\n\nI concur with this Court's opinion on rehearing insofar as it goes. However, in addition I would grant the Bar's application for an extension of time in which to make an additional request for rehearing. It is my understanding that the board of governors seeks such additional time in order to obtain clarification of certain portions of the Court's original opinion. Because the original opinion in this case made substantial revisions in the disciplinary procedures for the Bar, it does not appear inappropriate to grant additional time to The Florida Bar so that our new procedures may be fully clarified before the Bar commences to function under the new procedures.\n\nAccordingly, I dissent from the majority's denial of request No. 5.\n\nHATCHETT and ALDERMAN, JJ., concur.\n\nALDERMAN, Justice, concurring in part, dissenting in part.\n\nI would grant all five requests made by The Florida Bar in its petition for rehearing.\n\nBOYD and OVERTON, JJ., concur only as to request (4).\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003e1. Proposed rule 11.02(4)(d) provides: (d) UNEARNED FEES. (1) Definition: An unearned fee is a fee (a) which is not an historic common law retainer fee paid solely to secure availability of the services of a lawyer; (b) for which services have not yet been proportionately performed pursuant to the terms of the contract or other arrangement with the client; and (c) which the client had not expressly consented in writing shall be exempt from the provision of this rule 11.02(4)(d). (2) All monies received by a lawyer as unearned fees shall remain in the trust account and shall not be withdrawn until earned.\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003e2. Proposed rule 11.02(4)(e) provides: (e) STAFF AUDITORS AND RANDOM AUDITS. Staff auditors shall be retained by The Florida Bar and shall audit accounts of members of The Florida Bar on a random basis or when requested by staff counsel. A random audit shall be conducted in the following manner: (i) the auditor shall determine that the trust accounting procedures as provided in this rule are being followed. (ii) the auditor shall use sampling techniques to audit selected accounts unless discrepancies are found which would indicate a need for a more detailed or complete audit. (iii) audit reports shall be forwarded to staff counsel on a confidential basis. (iv) a copy of an audit conducted under this rule shall be furnished to the audited attorney forthwith.\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003e3. Proposed rule 11.04(3) provides: (3) THE ACCUSED. The accused Attorney may be required to testify and to produce evidence as any other witness unless he claims a privilege or right properly available to him under applicable federal or state law, and When so required he may be accompanied by counsel. Before any finding of probable cause or private reprimand is made the accused shall be advised in general terms the nature of the conduct which is being investigated and he shall be given an opportunity to make a statement personally or by counsel, verbally or in writing, sworn or unsworn, explaining, refuting or admitting the alleged misconduct. Unless found to be impractical by the chairman of the grievance committee due to unreasonable delay or other good cause, the accused shall be granted the right to be present at any grievance committee hearing when evidence is to be presented to the committee, to face his accuser, to call witnesses, and to cross examine subject to reasonable limitation.\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003e4. Proposed rule 11.10(9) provides: (9) EMPLOYMENT OF CERTAIN DISCIPLINED ATTORNEYS. When attorneys have been placed on the inactive list, suspended, disbarred or allowed resignation pursuant to Rule 11.08 by order of this Court, they are ineligible to practice law until reinstated or readmitted. No Florida lawyer shall employ a suspended, disbarred, Resigned or inactive lawyer in connection with the practice of law or permit such a lawyer to be in, upon or about law office premises except as a client. Any disbarred, suspended, resigned or inactive lawyer who accepts such employment or frequents law office premises other than as a client shall be in contempt of the disbarrment, suspension, resignation or inactive status order. However, this shall not preclude a lawyer, law firm or professional association from employing the suspended, disbarred or resigned individual to perform such services only as may ethically be performed by other lay persons employed in attorneys offices under the following conditions: (a) Notice of employment along with a full job description will be provided to staff counsel before employment commences. (b) Information reports verified by the employee and employer will be submitted to staff counsel quarterly, such reports shall contain a statement by the employing lawyer certifying that no aspect of the employee's work for the period involved the unauthorized practice of law. (c) No suspended or disbarred attorney shall have direct contact with any client or receive, disburse or otherwise handle funds or property of a client.\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003e5.

Except as Otherwise provided In Herein These Rules of Discipline, the time intervals required are directory only and are not jurisdictional. Failure to observe such directory intervals may result in contempt of the agency having jurisdiction or of the Supreme Court, but will not prejudice the offending party except where so provided. (a) SPEEDY PROBABLE CAUSE DETERMINATION. Except as otherwise provided by this Rule, a grievance committee shall have 90 days to conduct an investigation into alleged misconduct of an accused attorney, determine whether or not to make a finding of probable cause, and, if a finding of probable cause is made, file the record of its investigation and a formal complaint with the executive director. The time period established in this section commences 30 days after receipt of written charges of misconduct or lack of qualification by the staff counsel, or on the date of the first grievance committee meeting held following the committee's receipt of charges from staff counsel whichever first occurs. Upon timely application by a grievance committee, the Board of Governors may order an extension of time where exceptional circumstances, as defined in this Rule, are shown to exist. If no probable cause determination is timely made, upon motion filed with the Board of Governors and served upon the grievance committee the accused attorney shall be forever discharged from Bar discipline for the misconduct. The Board of Governors before granting such motion shall determine that the accused attorney has neither directly or indirectly hindered the investigation of the grievance committee. The filing date for this purpose shall be the date the record and formal complaint is postmarked by U.S. Mail addressed to Bar Headquarters or the date actually delivered to Bar Headquarters, whichever occurs first. (b) SPEEDY TRIAL RULE. Except as otherwise provided by this Rule, every attorney against whom a formal complaint is filed by a grievance committee or the Board of Governors shall be brought to trial within 90 days. The time period established by this section shall commence on the day after the date of filing of the formal complaint. The Referee may order an extension of time or continuance where exceptional circumstances, as defined in this Rule, are shown to exist. If no trial is timely held, upon motion filed with the Referee and served upon the Board of Governors the accused attorney shall be forever discharged from Bar discipline for the misconduct. The Referee before granting such motion shall determine that the accused attorney has neither directly or indirectly hindered the investigation of the complaint and has been continuously available during such period of time for trial. (c) EXCEPTIONAL CIRCUMSTANCES. Exceptional circumstances shall not include heavy caseload of grievance committee, investigators, or Bar counsel, lack of diligent preparation, failure to obtain available witnesses, or other avoidable or foreseeable delays. Exceptional circumstances are those which as a matter of substantial justice to the accused attorney or the Bar or both require an extension of time. Such circumstances include (i) unexpected illness or unexpected incapacity or unforeseeable and unavoidable absence of a person whose presence or testimony is uniquely necessary for a full and adequate investigation or trial; (ii) a showing by the Bar that the case is so unusual and so complex, due to the number of defendants or the nature of the investigation or prosecution or otherwise, that it is unreasonable to expect adequate investigation or preparation within the periods of time established by this Rule; (iii) a showing by the Bar that specific evidence or testimony is not available despite diligent efforts to secure it, but will become available at a later time; provided, not more than two continuances shall be granted on this ground; (iv) a showing by the accused or the Bar of necessity for delay grounded on developments which could not have been anticipated and which will materially affect the investigation or trial; (v) a showing that a delay is necessary to accommodate a co-defendant when there is reason not to sever the cases in order to proceed promptly with trial of the defendant; (vi) on mutual agreement of Bar counsel and the accused attorney which agreement is concurred in by the Board of Governors or referee; (vii) a showing by the Bar that the accused had caused major delay or disruption of preparation of proceedings, as by preventing the attendance of witnesses or otherwise. Under the foregoing circumstances the Referee may set a trial date or the Board of Governors may set a new limit on time for finding probable cause within a reasonable time. If proceedings are revived after being deferred under Rule 11.02(3)(b) this shall be considered an exceptional circumstance. (d) PENDING MATTERS. Rule (a) shall not apply to pending charges on which a committee has not found probable cause on the date this rule takes effect. Rule (b) shall not apply to pending cases on which there has been a finding of probable cause prior to the date this rule takes effect.\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003e7. Proposed rule 11.14 provides: Rule 11.14 QUALIFICATION PROCEEDINGS (1) NATURE OF PROCEEDINGS. Qualification proceedings shall relate to an attorney who is incapable of practicing law generally or in a particular field of law because of physical or mental disease or infirmity, lack of expertise or qualifications, inability to render legal services in a prompt and competent manner or other reason. At such times as may be appropriate proceedings shall be denoted as qualification proceedings and an investigatory grievance committee shall serve additionally as a qualification committee. Otherwise, such cases shall proceed in the same manner as other proceedings under this article. (2) REMEDIES WHICH MAY BE ADJUDGED. Disposition of such cases may include placing of the attorney upon an inactive list, imposition of appropriate restrictions upon the right to practice law or subjecting the right to practice law to appropriate conditions. Such conditions or restrictions may include, but are not limited to, practice under required supervision, compulsory attendance at designated continuing legal education programs, attendance at and passage of designated law school courses, passage of all or a designated portion of the examination given by the Board of Bar Examiners or other designated examination, loss or withdrawal of the right to list certification or specialty designations, or prohibition or limitation of the right to practice law in designated areas of law or before designated tribunals. When appropriate, such conditions or restrictions may be continuing or may be for a time certain. (3) RELIEF FROM QUALIFICATION ORDERS. Relief from continuing conditions or restrictions may be sought by petition to the Supreme Court with notice to The Florida Bar. Such petitions for relief may be referred to a referee for hearing and recommendation to the Supreme Court. (4) CONSOLIDATION WITH GRIEVANCE PROCEEDINGS. In appropriate cases involving common facts, a qualification proceeding may be consolidated for investigation and hearing with any other proceeding under this article.\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003e8. Proposed rule 11.03(3) provides: (3) REFEREES. The Board of Governors shall annually or as often as necessary recommend members of The Florida Bar to this court to act as referees in disciplinary proceedings. This court will certify annually or as often as necessary a panel of those approved to act as referees. All retired Supreme Court, district court of appeal and circuit judges shall be eligible, with their consent, to serve as referee. (3) REFEREES. The Supreme Court shall appoint referees to try disciplinary cases. Such appointees shall ordinarily be sitting circuit judges but the court may appoint retired judges or members of The Florida Bar with extensive trial experience. The referee shall reside in a different circuit than the respondent.\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003e9. Proposed rule 11.04(2)(a) provides: (a) INVESTIGATION. A grievance Or qualification committee is required to consider all charges of misconduct Or lack of qualification forwarded to the committee by staff counsel whether based upon a written complaint or not. No formal investigation by a grievance or qualification committee shall proceed unless the matter has been referred to the committee by staff counsel. All written charges of misconduct or lack of qualification received by a committee member from a source other than staff counsel shall within 10 days be forwarded to staff counsel for docketing and other appropriate action unless the committee member receiving the complaint satisfies the complainant within the 10-day period that formal investigation of the complaint is not required.\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003e10. Proposed rule 11.06(5)(d) provides: (d) DISPOSITION OF MOTIONS. Hearings upon motions may be deferred until the final hearing; and whenever heard, rulings thereon may be reserved until termination of the final hearing But a motion to maintain confidential status for the protection of a client or to continue the confidential status of a complaint founded on an attorney's rejection of a private reprimand for minor misconduct under rule 11.04(6)(c)(i) which is filed within 20 days after service of the complaint on the respondent shall be decided before trial and the proceedings shall remain confidential until an order is issued on the motion. When the motion is predicated on rejection of a private reprimand, confidentiality shall be retained unless the referee determines that the charge, if true, involves conduct more serious than minor misconduct as defined in rule 11.04(6)(c)(ii).\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\u003cspan class=\"fn\"\u003e* We thank the chairman and members of the special committee Frederick B.
